TI  == the influence of biofilm formation by gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes on bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the worldwide leading vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age. bv is characterized by the replacement of beneficial lactobacilli and the augmentation of anaerobic bacteria. gardnerella vaginalis is a predominant bacterial species, however, bv is also associated with other numerous anaerobes, such as atopobium vaginae, mobiluncus mulieris, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptoniphilus sp.. currently, the role of g. vaginalis in the etiology of bv remains a matter of controversy. it is however known that, in bv patients, a biofilm is usually formed on the vaginal epithelium and g. vaginalis is typically the predominant species. so, the current paradigm is that the establishment of a biofilm plays a key role in the pathogenesis of bv. this review provides background on the influence of biofilm formation by g. vaginalis and other anaerobes in the polymicrobial etiology of bv, through its initial adhesion until biofilm formation and discusses the commensal and synergic interactions established between them to understand the phenotypic shift of g. vaginalis' biofilms into bv establishment.

TI  == sensitive detection of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is characterized by a polymicrobial proliferation of anaerobic bacteria and depletion of lactobacilli, which are components of natural vaginal microbiota. currently, there are limited conventional methods for bv diagnosis, and these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and rarely allow for  the detection of more than one agent simultaneously. therefore, we conceived and  validated a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-pcr) assay for the simultaneous screening of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents (bv-aas) related to symptomatic bv: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, atopobium vaginae, ureaplasma urealyticum, megasphaera type i, clostridia-like bacteria vaginosis-associated bacteria (bvabs) 1, 2, and 3, sneathia sanguinegens, and mycoplasma genitalium. the overall validation parameters of m-pcr compared to single pcr (spcr) were extremely high, including agreement of 99.1% and sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of 100.0%, negative predictive value of 97.0%, accuracy of 99.3%, and agreement with nugent results of 100.0%. the prevalence of bv-aas was very high (72.6%), and simultaneous agents were detected in 53.0%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the m-pcr assay. therefore, the m-pcr assay has great potential to impact bv diagnostic methods in vaginal samples and  diminish associated complications in the near future.

TI  == the significance of lactobacillus crispatus and l. vaginalis for vaginal health and the negative effect of recent sex: a cross-sectional descriptive study across groups of african women.
AB  == background: women in sub-saharan africa are vulnerable to acquiring hiv infection and reproductive tract infections. bacterial vaginosis (bv), a disruption of the  vaginal microbiota, has been shown to be strongly associated with hiv infection.  risk factors related to potentially protective or harmful microbiota species are  not known. methods: we present cross-sectional quantitative polymerase chain reaction data of the lactobacillus genus, five lactobacillus species, and three bv-related bacteria (gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and prevotella bivia) together with escherichia coli and candida albicans in 426 african women across different groups at risk for hiv. we selected a reference group of adult hiv-negative women at average risk for hiv acquisition and compared species variations in subgroups of adolescents, hiv-negative pregnant women, women engaging in traditional vaginal practices, sex workers and a group of hiv-positive women on combination antiretroviral therapy. we explored the associations between presence and quantity of the bacteria with bv by nugent score, in relation to several factors of known or theoretical importance. results: the presence of species across kenyan, south african and rwandan women was remarkably similar and few differences were seen between the two groups of reference women in kenya and south africa. the rwandan sex workers and hiv-positive women had the highest g. vaginalis presence (p = 0.006). pregnant women had a higher lactobacillus genus mean log (7.01 genome equivalents (geq)/ml) compared to the reference women (6.08 geq/ml). l. vaginalis (43%) was second to l. iners (81.9%) highly present in women with a normal nugent score. recent sexual exposure negatively affected the presence of l. crispatus (<0.001), l. vaginalis (p = 0.001), and lactobacillus genus (p < 0.001). having more than one sexual partner in the last three months was associated with an increased prevalence of g. vaginalis (p = 0.044) and l. iners (p = 0.001). conclusions: although the composition of species across the studied african countries was similar, the presence of protective species i.e. l. crispatus and l. vaginalis in women with a normal nugent score appeared lower compared to non-african studies.  furthermore, lactobacillus species were negatively affected by sexual behavioural. strategies to support protective lactobacillus species are urgently  needed. trial registration: the study is registered at the trial registration at  the national health research ethics council south africa with the number doh2709103223.

TI  == the association of uterine cervical microbiota with an increased risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in korea.
AB  == recent studies have suggested potential roles of the microbiome in cervicovaginal diseases. however, there has been no report on the cervical microbiome in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin). we aimed to identify the cervical microbiota of korean women and assess the association between the cervical microbiota and cin, and to determine the combined effect of the microbiota and human papillomavirus (hpv) on the risk of cin. the cervical microbiota of 70 women with cin and 50 control women was analysed using pyrosequencing based on the 16s rrna gene. the associations between specific microbial patterns or abundance of specific microbiota and cin risk were assessed using multivariate logistic regression, and the relative excess risk due to interaction (reri) and the synergy index (s) were calculated. the phyla firmicutes, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, tenericutes, fusobacteria and tm7 were predominant in the microbiota and four distinct community types were observed in all women. a high score of the pattern characterized by predominance of atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus iners with a minority of lactobacillus crispatus had a higher cin risk (or 5.80, 95% ci 1.7319.4) and abundance of a. vaginae had a higher cin risk (or 6.63, 95% ci 1.6127.2). the synergistic effect  of a high score of this microbial pattern and oncogenic hpv was observed (or 34.1, 95% ci 4.95284.5; reri/s, 15.9/1.93). a predominance of a. vaginae, g. vaginalis and l. iners with a concomitant paucity of l. crispatus in the cervical microbiota was associated with cin risk, suggesting that bacterial dysbiosis and  its combination with oncogenic hpv may be a risk factor for cervical neoplasia.

TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == colonization of the upper genital tract by vaginal bacterial species in nonpregnant women.
AB  == objective: the objective of the study was to evaluate the upper genital tract (ugt) presence of vaginal bacterial species using sensitive molecular methods capable of detecting fastidious bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated bacteria. study design: vaginal swabs were collected prior to hysterectomy. the excised uterus was sterilely opened and swabs collected from the endometrium and upper endocervix. dna was tested in 11 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for 12 bacterial species: lactobacillus iners, l crispatus, l jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, megasphaera spp, prevotella spp, leptotrichia/sneathia, bvab1, bvab2, bvab3, and a broad-range16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene assay. endometrial fluid was tested with luminex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cytokines and defensins and tissue for gene expression of defensins and cathelicidin. results: we enrolled 58 women: mean aged 43 +/- 7 years, mostly white (n = 46; 79%) and bv negative (n = 43; 74%). by species-specific quantitative pcr, 55 (95%) had ugt colonization with at least 1  species (n = 52) or were positive by 16s pcr (n = 3). the most common species were l iners (45% ugt, 61% vagina), prevotella spp (33% ugt, 76% vagina) and l crispatus (33% ugt, 56% vagina). median quantities of bacteria in the ugt were lower than vaginal levels by 2-4 log10 ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene copies per swab. there were no differences in the endometrial inflammatory markers between women with no bacteria, lactobacillus only, or any bv-associated species in the ugt. conclusion: our data suggest that the endometrial cavity is not sterile in most women undergoing hysterectomy and that the presence of low levels of bacteria in the uterus is not associated with significant inflammation.

TI  == high atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis vaginal loads are associated with preterm birth.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis is a risk factor for preterm birth. the various conventional methods for its diagnosis are laborious and not easily reproducible. molecular quantification methods have been reported recently, but the specific risk factors they might identify remain unclear. methods: a prospective multicenter national study included pregnant women at risk of preterm birth. a quantitative molecular tool using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction  assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension quantified atopobium vaginae,  gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacilli, mycoplasma hominis, and the human albumin gene (for quality control). results: in 813 pregnancies, high vaginal loads of either or both of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were associated with preterm birth  (hazard ratio [hr], 3.9; 95% confidence interval {ci}, 1.1-14.1; p = .031). a high vaginal load of a. vaginae was significantly associated with shortened time  to delivery and therefore pregnancy length. these times were, respectively, 152.2 and 188.2 days (hr, 5.6; 95% ci, 1.5-21.3; p < .001) before 22 weeks, 149.0 and 183.2 days (hr, 2.8; 95% ci, 1.1-8.2; p = .048) before 28 weeks, and 132.6 and 170.4 days (hr, 2.2; 95% ci, 1.1-4.6; p = .033) before 32 weeks. after multivariate analysis, a. vaginae levels >/=10(8) copies/ml remained significantly associated with delivery before 22 weeks of gestation (adjusted hr, 4.7; 95% ci, .2-17.6; p = .014). conclusions: high vaginal loads of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis are associated with late miscarriage and prematurity in high-risk pregnancies. a high vaginal load of a. vaginae (dna level >/=10(8) copies/ml) identifies a population at high risk of preterm birth. further studies that both screen for and then treat a. vaginae are needed. clinical trials registration: nct00484653.

TI  == quantification of atopobium vaginae loads may be a new method for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: traditional methods for the diagnosis of bv is either with poor sensitivity or poor specificity. thus, establishing a new method based on the vaginal flora is vital for the diagnosis of bv. methods: this article is a retrospective research. based on the amsel criteria and nugent score, 230 bv-positive patients and 360 healthy women were enrolled, specific pcr and quantitative pcr were applied to quantify 5 bv-associated bacteria, including gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, leptotrichia/sneathia species, megasphaera species and mobiluncus mulieris. roc curve was facilitated to screen  a bacterial panel with optimal sensitivity and specificity. results: specific pcr showed that the area under roc curve of a.vag, g.vag + a.vag, g.vag + a.vag + lepto, g.vag + a.vag + mega and g.vag + a.vag + m.mul were 0.845, 0.862, 0.865, 0.869 and 0.867, the sensitivity and specificity were higher than 80%, which were practicable methods for the diagnosis of bv. quantitative pcr showed the area under roc curve of gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, leptotrichia/sneathia species, megasphaera species and mobiluncus mulieris were 0.959, 0.996, 0.933, 0.748 and 0.639, when the cutoff value of atopobium vaginae  loads was 247,800 copies/ml, the optimal sensitivity and specificity were 0.979 and 0.952, which was distinctly better than specific pcr. conclusions: quantification ofatopobium vaginae loads may be a new method of excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of bv.

TI  == characterization of the vaginal microflora in health and disease.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is an imbalance of the vaginal bacterial microbiota and its aetiology is still unknown. our aims were to investigate the diagnostic potential of species/genus specific quantitative pcr (qpcr) for bacteria present in swabs and first-void urine (fvu) samples using nugent's and claeys' criteria and 454 sequencing of the vaginal microbiome as reference. methods: self-collected swabs, vaginal smears and fvu were obtained from 177 women from greenland (study i and iii) and physician-collected vaginal swabs and  smears were obtained from 163 swedish women (study ii). bv was diagnosed by nugent's criteria in study i and iii and by amsel's criteria in study ii. the vaginal swabs and fvu samples were analysed by qpcr for selected vaginal bacteria in all three studies and for four sexually transmitted infections (stis) in study i. results: study i: stis were common in women from greenland and bv was found in 45% of these women but was not associated with individual stis. in multivariate logistic analysis, atopobium vaginae and prevotella spp. were both independently  associated with bv in swabs. bv could be subdivided into clusters dominated by a  single or a few species together. seven vaginal bacteria (a. vaginae, prevotella  spp. gardnerella vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis associated bacterium (bvab) 2, eggerthella-like bacterium, leptotrichia amnionii and megasphaera type 1) had areas under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve > 85% in swabs, suggesting that they were good predictors of bv according to nugent. study ii: for the majority of species/genera, the kappa values indicated fair to good agreement when their presence was determined by 454 pyrosequencing versus real-time pcr. the same seven vaginal bacteria as found in study i, had areas under the roc-curve > 85% in swabs from swedish women, demonstrating a good diagnostic accuracy for bv according to amsel. study iii: in a multivariate model, megasphaera type 1 and prevotella spp. remained significantly associated with bv in fvu samples. a linear regression analysis showed good agreement between bacterial load from swabs and fvu, but prevotella spp. could be detected  in high numbers in a few fvu samples without being present in swabs. after applying roc curve analysis, the same seven vaginal bacteria as previously mentioned showed good prediction for bv according to nugent in fvu. bv could be detected with comparable sensitivity in fvu and vaginal swabs. conclusion: bv can be diagnosed by molecular methods performed either on swabs or urine but it is important to apply thresholds in order to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis.  furthers it was possible to identify clusters of bv dominated by single or paired bacteria, and these clusters could classify bv into subgroups, providing a more detailed understanding of the condition. seven vaginal bacteria were highly accurate for bv diagnosis both in swabs and fvu. finally a good agreement between nugent and claeys was found.

TI  == bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling.
AB  == objectives: sexually transmitted infections are a significant cause of genital disease, infertility and hospital admissions. the economic impact is high. an accurate diagnosis is often difficult and time consuming. we report the development and validation of a novel bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling (stip) assay that detects 18 sexually transmitted infections  using a multiplex pcr followed by luminex bead-based hybridisation. methods: stip was validated using urogenital samples pretested by commercially available quantitative pcr, microscopy or by culturing methods. results: stip specifically  detects chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, treponema pallidum,  trichomonas vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma (m.) genitalium, m. hominis, m. pneumonia, m. spermatophilum, ureaplasma urealyticum and u. parvum, and quantifies bacterial vaginosis-associated atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis as well as three candida species and normal genital flora-associated lactobacillus species. stip reached an overall concordance of 95-100% with commercially available quantitative pcr tests. compared to nugent score, stip reached a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 86% for bacterial vaginosis detection. candida specimens, pretested by direct culturing, were identified with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 99%. conclusions: stip is a powerful high-throughput tool in assessing a broad spectrum of urogenital infections.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by analysis of first-void-urine specimens.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is traditionally diagnosed using vaginal samples. the aim of this study was to investigate whether bv can be diagnosed from first-void  urine (fvu). self-collected vaginal smears, vaginal swabs, and fvu were obtained  from 176 women. bv was diagnosed by nugent's criteria. the fvu and vaginal swabs  were analyzed by quantitative pcrs (qpcrs) for selected vaginal bacteria (atopobium vaginae, prevotella spp., gardnerella vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium 2, eggerthella-like bacterium, "leptotrichia amnionii," megasphaera type 1), and all had an area under the receiver operating  characteristic (roc) curve of >85%, suggesting good prediction of bv according to the nugent score. all seven bacteria in fvu were significantly associated with bv in univariate analysis. an accurate diagnosis of bv from urine was obtained in this population by a combination of qpcrs for megasphaera type 1 and prevotella spp. the same two bacteria remained significantly associated with bv in a multivariate model after adjusting for the other five species. there was no statistically significant difference between the sensitivities and specificities  of bv diagnosis by molecular methods performed on swabs and fvu samples. a linear regression analysis showed good agreement between bacterial loads from swabs and  fvu, but prevotella spp. could be detected in high numbers in a few fvu samples without being present in swabs. this method will allow diagnosis of bv in studies where only urine has been collected and where detection of bv is considered relevant.

TI  == vaginal microbiome in women from greenland assessed by microscopy and quantitative pcr.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition, although its aetiology remains unexplained. the aim of this study was to analyse the composition of vaginal microbiota in women from greenland to provide a quantitative description and improve the understanding of bv. methods: self-collected vaginal smears and swabs were obtained from 177 women. the vaginal smears were graded for bv according to nugent's criteria. the vaginal swab samples were analysed by 19 quantitative pcrs (qpcrs) for selected vaginal bacteria and by pcr for four sexually transmitted infections (stis). results: stis were common: mycoplasma genitalium 12%, chlamydia trachomatis 7%, neisseria  gonorrhoeae 1%, and trichomonas vaginalis 0.5%. bv was found in 45% of women, but was not associated with individual stis. seven of the 19 vaginal bacteria (atopobium vaginae, prevotella spp., gardnerella vaginalis, bvab2, eggerthella-like bacterium, leptotrichia amnionii, and megasphaera type 1) had areas under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve > 85%, suggesting they are good predictors of bv according to nugent. prevotella spp. had the highest odds ratio for bv (or 437; 95% ci 82-2779) in univariate analysis considering only specimens with a bacterial load above the threshold determined by roc curve analysis as positive, as well as the highest adjusted odds ratio in  multivariate logistic regression analysis (or 4.4; 95% ci 1.4-13.5). bv could be  subdivided into clusters dominated by a single or a few species together. conclusions: bv by nugent score was highly prevalent. two of seven key species (prevotella spp. and a. vaginae) remained significantly associated with bv in a multivariate model after adjusting for other bacterial species. g. vaginalis and  prevotella spp. defined the majority of bv clusters.

TI  == [diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a common, complex clinical syndrome characterized by alterations in the normal vaginal flora. when symptomatic, it is associated with  a malodorous vaginal discharge and on occasion vaginal burning or itching. under  normal conditions, lactobacilli constitute 95% of the bacteria in the vagina. bacterial vaginosis is associated with severe reduction or absence of the normal  h2o2-producing lactobacilli and overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and gardnerella  vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, mycoplasma hominis and mobiluncus species. most types of infectious disease are diagnosed by culture, by isolating an antigen or  rna/dna from the microbe, or by serodiagnosis to determine the presence of antibodies to the microbe. therefore, demonstration of the presence of an infectious agent is often a necessary criterion for the diagnosis of the disease. this is not the case for bacterial vaginosis, since the ultimate cause of the disease is not yet known. there are a variety of methods for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis but no method can at present be regarded as the best. diagnosing bacterial vaginosis has long been based on the clinical criteria of amsel, whereby three of four defined criteria must be satisfied. nugent's scoring system has been further developed and includes validation of the categories of observable bacteria structures. up-to-date molecular tests are introduced, and better understanding of vaginal microbiome, a clear definition for bacterial vaginosis, and short-term and long-term fluctuations in vaginal microflora will help to better define molecular tests within the broader clinical context.

TI  == the villain team-up or how trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis alter innate immunity in concert.
AB  == objectives: complex interactions of vaginal microorganisms with the genital tract epithelium shape mucosal innate immunity, which holds the key to sexual and reproductive health. bacterial vaginosis (bv), a microbiome-disturbance syndrome  prevalent in reproductive-age women, occurs commonly in concert with trichomoniasis, and both are associated with increased risk of adverse reproductive outcomes and viral infections, largely attributable to inflammation. to investigate the causative relationships among inflammation, bv and trichomoniasis, we established a model of human cervicovaginal epithelial cells colonised by vaginal lactobacillus isolates, dominant in healthy women, and common bv species (atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia). methods: colonised epithelia were infected with trichomonas vaginalis (tv) or exposed to purified tv virulence factors (membrane lipophosphoglycan (lpg), its ceramide-phosphoinositol-glycan core (cpi-gc) or the endosymbiont trichomonas vaginalis virus (tvv)), followed by assessment of bacterial colony-forming units, the mucosal anti-inflammatory microbicide secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and chemokines that drive pro-inflammatory,  antigen-presenting and t cells. results: tv reduced colonisation by lactobacillus but not by bv species, which were found inside epithelial cells. tv increased interleukin (il)-8 and suppressed slpi, likely via lpg/cpi-gc, and upregulated il-8 and rantes, likely via tvv as suggested by use of purified pathogenic determinants. bv species a vaginae and g vaginalis induced il-8 and rantes, and also amplified the pro-inflammatory responses to both lpg/cpi-gc and tvv, whereas p bivia suppressed the tv/tvv-induced chemokines. conclusions: these molecular host-parasite-endosymbiont-bacteria interactions explain epidemiological associations and suggest a revised paradigm for restoring vaginal immunity and preventing bv/tv-attributable inflammatory sequelae in women.

TI  == composition of the vaginal microbiota in women of reproductive age--sensitive and specific molecular diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is possible?
AB  == background and objective: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common vaginal disorder, characterized by depletion of the normal lactobacillus-dominant microbiota and overgrowth of commensal anaerobic bacteria. this study aimed to investigate the composition of the vaginal microbiota in women of reproductive age (healthy women and women with bv), with the view of developing molecular criteria for bv diagnosis. materials and methods: vaginal samples from 163 women  (79 control, 73 bv and 11 intermediate (lactobacillary grade ii flora) cases) were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing of the hypervariable regions v3-v4 of the  16s rrna gene and 16 quantitative bacterial species/genus-specific real-time pcr  assays. sensitivities and specificities of potential bv markers were computed using the amsel criteria as reference standard for bv. the use of quantitative thresholds for prediction of bv, determined for both relative abundance measured  with 454 pyrosequencing and bacterial load measured with qpcr, was evaluated. results: relative to the healthy women, the bv patients had in their vaginal microbiota significantly higher prevalence, loads and relative abundances of the  majority of bv associated bacteria. however, only gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, eggerthella, prevotella, bvab2 and megasphaera type 1 detected at or above optimal thresholds were highly predictable for bv, with the best diagnostic accuracy shown for a. vaginae. the depletion of lactobacillus species  combined with the presence of either g. vaginalis or a. vaginae at diagnostic levels was a highly accurate bv predictor. conclusions: quantitative determination of the presence of g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, eggerthella, prevotella, bvab2 and megasphaera type 1 as well as the depletion of lactobacillus was highly accurate for bv diagnosis. measurements of abundance of  normal and bv microbiota relative to total bacteria in vaginal fluid may provide  more accurate bv diagnosis, and be used for test-of-cure, rather than qualitative detection or absolute counts of bv related microorganisms.

TI  == effect of sexual debut on vaginal microbiota in a cohort of young women.
AB  == objective: bacterial vaginosis is uncommon in women who are virgins. we estimated effects of sexual debut on vaginal bacterial colonization. methods: women who were virgins and aged 18-22 years enrolled in a study of human papillomavirus acquisition were followed every 4 months for up to 2 years. vaginal swabs from before and after sexual debut or two independent visits for those remaining virgins were tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, gardnerella vaginalis, and the bacterial vaginosis-associated species atopobium vaginae, megasphaera species, leptotrichia species, sneathia species, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium-1, -2, and -3. results: we evaluated 97 women: 71  who became sexually active and 26 who remained virgins. at first sampling, 22 of  26 (85%) women who remained virgins were colonized with lactobacillus species compared with 22 of 26 (85%) at follow-up (p>.99). g vaginalis was present in 12  of 26 (46%) initially and 11 of 26 (42%) at follow-up (p>.99). among women who became sexually active, colonization with lactobacillus species remained stable:  65 of 71 (92%) compared with 66 of 71 (93%) (p>.99), whereas colonization with g  vaginalis increased (28 of 71 [39%] compared with 40 of 71 [56%]; p=.02). among women who did not initiate sexual activity during the study, two of 26 (8%) had any bacterial vaginosis-associated species detected at both the first and second  visits (p>.99). among women who became sexually active during the study, 15 of 71 (21%) were colonized with bacterial vaginosis-associated species initially compared with 13 of 71 (18%) after sexual debut (p=.77). conclusions: among women who were virgins, vaginal colonization with bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterial species is uncommon and does not change after sexual debut.

AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common pathology of women in reproductive age that can lead to serious health complications, and is associated with shifts in the normal microflora from predominance of lactobacillus spp. to a proliferation of other anaerobes such as g. vaginalis and a vaginae, which can be detected by pcr. the optimal pcr pathogen detection assay relies mainly on the specificity and sensitivity of the primers used. findings: here we demonstrate that in silico analytical testing of primer specificity is not a synonym to in vitro analytical specificity by testing a range of published and newly designed primers with both techniques for the detection of bv-associated microorganisms. conclusions: by testing primer in vitro specificity with a sufficient range of bacterial strains, we were able to design primers with higher specificity and sensitivity. also by comparing the results obtained for the newly designed primers with other previously published primers, we confirmed that in silico analysis is not sufficient to predict in vitro specificity. as such care must be  taken when choosing the primers for a detection assay.

TI  == longitudinal qpcr study of the dynamics of l. crispatus, l. iners, a. vaginae, (sialidase positive) g. vaginalis, and p. bivia in the vagina.
AB  == background: to obtain more detailed understanding of the causes of disturbance of the vaginal microflora (vmf), a longitudinal study was carried out for 17 women during two menstrual cycles. methods: vaginal swabs were obtained daily from 17 non-pregnant, menarchal volunteers. for each woman, gram stains were scored, the  quantitative changes of 5 key vaginal species, i.e. atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus crispatus, l. iners, (sialidase positive) gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia were quantified with qpcr and hydrogen-peroxide production was assessed on tmb+ agar. results: women could be divided in 9 subjects with predominantly normal vmf (grades ia, ib and iab, group n) and 8 with predominantly disturbed vmf (grades i-like, ii, iii and iv, group d). vmf was variable between women, but overall stable for most of the women. menses were the strongest disturbing factor of the vmf. l. crispatus was present at log7-9 cells/ml in grade ia, iab and ii vmf, but concentrations declined 100-fold during menses. l. crispatus below log7 cells/ml corresponded with poor h(2)o(2)-production. l. iners was present at log 10 cells/ml in grade ib, ii and  iii vmf. sialidase negative g. vaginalis strains (average log5 cells/ml) were detected in grade i, i-like and iv vmf. in grade ii vmf, predominantly a mixture  of both sialidase negative and positive g. vaginalis strains (average log9 cells/ml) were present, and predominantly sialidase positive strains in grade iii vmf. the presence of a. vaginae (average log9 cells/ml) coincided with grade ii and iii vmf. p. bivia (log4-8 cells/ml) was mostly present in grade iii vaginal microflora. l. iners, g. vaginalis, a. vaginae and p. bivia all increased around  menses for group n women, and as such l. iners was considered a member of disturbed vmf. conclusions: this qpcr-based study confirms largely the results of previous culture-based, microscopy-based and pyrosequencing-based studies.

TI  == development and validation of a semiquantitative, multitarget pcr assay for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == quantitative pcr assays were developed for 4 organisms reported previously to be  useful positive indicators for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (bv)--atopobium vaginae, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium 2 (bvab-2), gardnerella vaginalis, and megasphaera-1--and a single organism (lactobacillus crispatus) that has been implicated as a negative indicator for bv. vaginal samples (n = 169), classified as positive (n = 108) or negative (n = 61) for bv based on a combination of the nugent gram stain score and amsel clinical criteria, were analyzed for the presence and quantity of each of the marker organisms, and the results were used to construct a semiquantitative, multiplex pcr assay for bv based on detection of 3 positive indicator organisms (a. vaginae, bvab-2, and megasphaera-1) and classification of samples using a combinatorial scoring system. the prototype bv pcr assay was then used to analyze the 169-member developmental sample set and, in a prospective, blinded manner, an additional 227 bv-classified vaginal samples (110 bv-positive samples and 117 bv-negative samples). the bv pcr assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.7% (202/209), a specificity of 92.2% (153/166), a positive predictive value of 94.0%, and a negative predictive value of 95.6%, with 21 samples (5.3%) classified as indeterminate for bv. this assay provides a reproducible and objective means of evaluating critical components of the vaginal microflora in women with signs and symptoms of vaginitis and is comparable in diagnostic accuracy to the conventional gold standard for diagnosis of bv.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) candidate bacteria: associations with bv and behavioural practices in sexually-experienced and inexperienced women.
AB  == background: in recent years several new fastidious bacteria have been identified  that display a high specificity for bv; however no previous studies have comprehensively assessed the behavioural risk associations of these bacterial vaginosis-candidate organisms (bv-cos). methods: we examined the associations between 8 key previously described bv-cos and bv status established by nugent's score (ns). we also examined the sexual practices associated with each bv-co. we  incorporated 2 study populations: 193 from a sexually-inexperienced university population and 146 from a highly sexually-active clinic population. detailed behavioural data was collected by questionnaire and vaginal smears were scored by the nugent method. stored samples were tested by quantitative pcr assays for the  8 bv-cos: atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, leptotrichia spp., megasphaera type i, sneathia spp., and the clostridia-like bacteria bvab1, bvab2  and bvab3. associations between bv-cos and bv and behaviours were examined by univariate and multivariable analyses. results: on univariate analysis, all bv-cos were more common in bv compared to normal flora. however, only megasphaera type i, bvab2, a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were significantly independently associated with bv by multivariable analysis. six of the eight bv-cos (megasphaera type i, bvab2, bvab3, sneathia, leptotrichia and g. vaginalis) were  rare or absent in sexually-unexposed women, and demonstrated increasing odds of detection with increasing levels of sexual activity and/or numbers of lifetime sexual partners. only g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were commonly detected in sexually-unexposed women. megasphaera type i was independently associated with women-who-have-sex-with women (wsw) and lifetime sexual partner numbers, while unprotected penile-vaginal-sex was associated with bvab2 detection by multivariate analysis. conclusions: four of eight key bv-cos were significantly associated with bv after adjusting for the presence of other bv-cos. the majority of bv-cos were absent or rare in sexually-unexposed women, and associated with increasing sexual exposure, suggesting potential sexual transmission of bv-cos.

TI  == detection of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna genes for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
AB  == to preliminarily evaluate the applicability of bacterial dna as a marker for the  forensic identification of vaginal fluid, we developed and performed pcr-based detection of 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus spp. dominating the vagina  and of bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria from dna extracted from body fluids and stains. as a result, 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii and atopobium vaginae were specifically detected in vaginal fluid and female urine samples. bacterial genes detected in female urine  might have originated from contaminated vaginal fluid. in addition, those of lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis were also detected in non-vaginal body fluids such as semen. because bacterial genes were successfully amplified in dna samples extracted by using the general procedure for animal tissues without any optional treatments, dna samples prepared for the  identification of vaginal fluid can also be used for personal identification. in  conclusion, 16s ribosomal rna genes of l. crispatus, l. jensenii and a. vaginae could be effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.

TI  == [bacterial vaginosis in 2011: a lot of questions remain].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is one of the most frequent vaginal affections. it results from a deep imbalance of the vaginal ecosystem whose mechanisms remain mysterious, even if recent progress were accomplished in their comprehension: if  the flora implied in the bacterial vaginosis is recognized like polymorphic, it appears that gardnerella vaginalis plays a major part with two genomically different forms: a commensal form (slightly adhesive to the epithelial cells), and a pathogenic one (strongly adhesive to the epithelial cells); the changes in  lactobacilli are also to take into account: l. iners could be a marker of the vaginal flora imbalance whereas l. crispatus is generally met in the normal vaginal flora. these findings could influence the composition of coming probiotics; it is recognized that bacterial vaginosis is involved in the risk of  prematurity but molecular quantification of g. vaginalis (and of atopobium vaginae) is more sensitive for the diagnosis of bv what could improve the detection of high-risk pregnant women. the isolated antibiotic treatments are not very effective on the prevention of recurrences. the rebalancing of the vaginal flora is essential. in this field, the local estrogens showed some effectiveness. the use of probiotics is promising and can be recommended in complement of the antibiotic treatment even if the results of the clinical studies are still too heterogeneous to lead to precise indications.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis, atopobium vaginae and nifuratel.
AB  == as bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a potential cause of obstetric complications and gynecological disorders, there is substantial interest in establishing the most effective treatment. standard treatment - metronidazole or clindamycin, by either vaginal or oral route is followed by relapses in about 30% of cases, within a month from treatment completion. this inability to prevent recurrences reflects our lack of knowledge on the origins of bv. atopobium vaginae has been recently reported to be associated with bv in around 80% of the cases and might be involved in the therapeutic failures. this review looks at the potential benefits of nifuratel against a. vaginae compared to the standard treatments with metronidazole and clindamycin. in vitro, nifuratel is able to inhibit the growth  of a. vaginae, with a mic range of 0.125-1 mug/ml; it is active against g. vaginalis and does not affect lactobacilli. metronidazole is active against a. vaginae only at very high concentrations (8-256 mug/ml); it is partially active against g. vaginalis and also has no effect on lactobacilli. clindamycin acts against a. vaginae with an mic lower than 0.125 mug/ml and is active on g. vaginalis but it also affects lactobacilli, altering the vaginal environment. these observations suggest that nifuratel is probably the most valid therapeutic  agent for bv treatment.

TI  == multiplex detection of bacteria in complex clinical and environmental samples using oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent microspheres.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a recurring polymicrobial syndrome that is characterized by a change in the "normal" microbiota from lactobacillus-dominated to a microbiota dominated by a number of bacterial species, including gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and others. this condition is associated with a range of negative health outcomes, including hiv acquisition, and it can be difficult to manage clinically. furthermore, diagnosis of bv has relied on the use of gram stains of vaginal swab smears that are scored on various numerical criteria. while this diagnostic is simple, inexpensive, and well suited to resource-limited settings, it can suffer from problems related to subjective interpretations and it does not give a detailed profile of the composition of the vaginal microbiota. recent deep sequencing efforts have revealed a rich, diverse  vaginal microbiota with clear differences between samples taken from individuals  that are diagnosed with bv compared to those individuals that are considered normal, which has resulted in the identification of a number of potential targets for molecular diagnosis of bv. these studies have provided a wealth of useful information, but deep sequencing is not yet practical as a diagnostic method in a clinical setting. we have recently described a method for rapidly profiling the vaginal microbiota in a multiplex format using oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent beads with detection on a luminex platform. this method, like current gram stain-based methods, is rapid and simple but adds the additional advantage of exploiting molecular knowledge arising from sequencing studies in probe design. this method therefore provides a way to profile the major microorganisms  that are present in a vaginal swab that can be used to diagnose bv with high specificity and sensitivity compared to gram stain while providing additional information on species presence and abundance in a semi-quantitative and rapid manner. this multiplex method is expandable well beyond the range of current quantitative pcr assays for particular organisms, which is currently limited to 5 or 6 different assays in a single sample. importantly, the method is not limited  to the detection of bacteria in vaginal swabs and can be easily adapted to rapidly profile nearly any microbial community of interest. for example, we have  recently begun to apply this methodology to the development of diagnostic tools for use in wastewater treatment plants.

TI  == the complex vaginal flora of west african women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the spectrum of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv) has recently expanded through taxonomic changes and the use of molecular methods. these methods have yet to be used in large-scale epidemiological studies in africa where bv is highly prevalent. methods: an analysis of samples obtained during a clinical trial of the management of vaginal discharge in four west african countries. samples were available from 1555 participants; 843 (54%) had bv. nucleic acids of 13 bacterial genera or species potentially associated with bv were detected through the polymerase chain reaction. results: the associations between various components of the vaginal flora were complex. excluding lactobacillus, the other 12 micro-organisms were all associated with each other at the p</=0.001 level. the prevalence of various bacterial genera or species varied according to age, sexual activity and hiv status. in multivariate analysis, the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, bifidobacterium, megasphaera elsdenii, dialister, mycoplasma hominis, leptotrichia, and prevotella were independently associated with bv as was the absence of lactobacillus and peptoniphilus. however, mobiluncus, atopobium vaginae, anaerococcus, and eggerthella were not independently associated with bv. unexpectedly, after treatment with a regimen that included either metronidazole or tinidazole, the proportion of patients with a complete resolution of symptoms by day 14 increased with the number of bacterial genera or species present at enrolment. conclusions: numerous bacterial genera or species were strongly associated with each other in  a pattern that suggested a symbiotic relationship. bv cases with a simpler flora  were less likely to respond to treatment. overall, the vaginal flora of west african women with bv was reminiscent of that of their counterparts in industrialized countries.

TI  == the genital econiche: focus on microbiota and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == ecological and evolutionary forces shaping the normal and abnormal microflora of  the genital econiche are discussed, in particular those related to bacterial vaginosis, which worldwide is the most common vaginal infection, with numerous obstetrical and gynecological complications, including acquisition and transmission of hiv and other sexually transmitted infections (stis). characterized by a heavy overgrowth of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes  with no signs of inflammation, bacterial vaginosis has been regarded a microbiological and immunological enigma. immune tolerance to both normal and abnormal vaginal microbiota, mainly derived from gut microflora, as a result of coevolution with humans might explain the absence of inflammation, supported by short-chain fatty acids, known to modulate immune responses, that are produced in large quantities by anaerobes. recent studies have implicated the development of  a vaginal biofilm with gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae as main players in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis. supporting this conclusion are data such as those demonstrating heavy growth of g. vaginalis and diversified anaerobes with numerous "clue cells" that are sloughing off from the biofilm. gardnerella and atopobium organisms attached to these clue cells can be demonstrated in the male genital econiche, likely reflecting a heterosexual transmission of the disorder.

AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using self-collected vaginal specimens for the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays of bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated bacteria versus practitioner-collected swabs. a cross-sectional study included 190 pregnant women enrolled before 20 weeks' gestation from september 2008 to november 2009. self- and practitioner-collected swabs were taken during the same prenatal visit for each woman, qpcr assays performed for each, and the results compared. the quantification of the human albumin gene was used as an internal control to ensure sampling quality and accurate comparisons. the level of agreement of the qpcr assays for each microorganism was calculated with the spearman product moment correlation coefficient and the kappa statistic. in all, 370 vaginal samples (185 self- and 185 practitioner-collected swabs) had a narrow range of values for the number of albumin gene copies and a significant correlation coefficient (spearman's rho = 0.532; p < 0.001). the agreement between both sampling methods was excellent (spearman's rho was 0.748 for atopobium vaginae, 0.918 for lactobacillus species, 0.940 for gardnerella vaginalis; p < 0.001), especially for high concentrations of a. vaginae (>/=10(8) copies/ml; kappa value = 0.973; p < 0.001) and g. vaginalis (>/=10(9) copies/ml; kappa value = 0.903; p  < 0.001). this study demonstrates the validity and reliability of self- versus practitioner-collected swabs for the molecular quantification of lactobacillus species, g. vaginalis, and a. vaginae.

TI  == disruption of urogenital biofilms by lactobacilli.
AB  == the process that changes a relatively sparse vaginal microbiota of healthy women  into a dense biofilm of pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria is poorly  understood. likewise, the reverse step whereby an aberrant biofilm is displaced and returns to a healthy lactobacilli dominated microbiota is unclear. in order to study these phenomena, in vitro experiments were performed to examine the structure of biofilms associated with aerobic vaginosis, urinary tract infections, and bacterial vaginosis (bv). uropathogenic escherichia coli were able to form relatively thin biofilms within five days (6 mum height), while atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis formed thicker biofilms 12 mum in height within two days. challenge of e. coli biofilms with lactobacilli did not result in pathogen displacement. however, the resulting thicker lactobacilli infused biofilms, caused significant e. coli killing. e. coli biofilms challenged with secreted products of l. rhamnosus gr-1 caused a marked decrease in cell density, and increased cell death. similarly challenge of bv biofilms with lactobacilli infiltrated bv biofilms and caused bacterial cell death. metronidazole produced holes in the biofilm but did not eradicate the organisms.  the findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an aberrant vaginal microbiota, and strengthen the position that combining probiotics with antimicrobials could better eradicate pathogenic biofilms.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of menstruation on the bacterial population of healthy japanese women's vulvas, especially the labia minora. labia minora swabs were obtained from 10 premenopausal, nonpregnant japanese women at premenstruation and on day 2 of menstruation. vaginal swabs were also obtained from 3 out of the 10 women. no significant difference was found in the average bacterial cell count between the menstruation and premenstruation samples. molecular analysis using a 16s rrna gene-based clone library method detected 22 genera from the labia minora swabs (total 20), with the genus lactobacillus being predominant at both premenstruation and during menstruation in 7 out of the 10 women. of the other 3 women, 2 showed various kinds of bacterial species, including oral and fecal bacteria, with atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis predominating in the remaining woman's vulva in both conditions. in total, 6 out of 10 cases (60%) showed significantly different microbiota of the labia minora between the two conditions. these results imply that menstruation may promote a distortion of the bacterial flora around the vulva, although it causes no significant increase of the bacterial count.

TI  == high vaginal concentrations of atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis in women undergoing preterm labor.
AB  == objective: to estimate the relationship between vaginal quantification of the main microorganisms related with bacterial vaginosis and the risk of preterm delivery among women with preterm labor. methods: molecular methods were used to  prospectively quantify lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and mycoplasma hominis in vaginal fluid samples from women admitted for  spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes from july 2007 through july 2008. the primary outcome measure was the relationship between bacterial concentration  at admission and preterm delivery, before 37 weeks of gestation. sensitivity and  specificity of molecular cutoff values and 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated using the university of british columbia bayesian calculator type 2. results: of the 90 women included, 36 delivered before 37 weeks of gestation (40%). preterm delivery was not associated with the presence of lactobacillus species, g vaginalis, a vaginae, or m hominis. in contrast, molecular quantification detected high concentrations of a vaginae (10(6)/ml or more: 25.0% in the preterm group and 9.3% in the term group, p=.04) and g vaginalis (10(7)/ml or more: 16.7% and 3.7%, p=.03) more often in women with preterm deliveries compared with term deliveries. moreover, high vaginal concentrations of these two microorganisms together were associated with a significantly (p=.03) shorter interval between preterm labor and delivery (46 days, 95% ci 30-61) than were lower concentrations (85 days, 95% ci 75-95). the hazard ratio for a short preterm labor-to-delivery interval was three times higher for high vaginal fluid  concentrations of a vaginae and g vaginalis than for lower concentrations (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% ci 1.1-9.5, p=.03). conclusion: the risk of preterm delivery is significantly associated with high vaginal concentrations of a vaginae and g vaginalis in women with preterm labor. clinical trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, nct00484653. level of evidence: iii.

TI  == multiplex detection of bacteria associated with normal microbiota and with bacterial vaginosis in vaginal swabs by use of oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent microspheres.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a recurrent condition that is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases, preterm births, and pelvic inflammatory  disease. in contrast to the lactobacillus-dominated normal vaginal microbiota, bv is characterized by a lack of lactobacilli and an abundance of anaerobic and gram-negative organisms, including gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae. to date, the laboratory diagnosis of bv has relied upon the fulfillment of criteria determined by microscopic observation of gram-stained vaginal swabs. we  describe a molecular-based method for the easy determination of the species profile within the vaginal microbiota based on the amplification of the chaperonin-60 genes of all bacteria present in the swab and hybridization of the  amplicon to species-specific oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent beads that are identified by flow cytometry with a luminex instrument. we designed a nineplex luminex array for characterization of the vaginal microbiota and applied it to the analysis of vaginal swabs from individuals from africa and north america. using the presence of a. vaginae or g. vaginalis, or both, as the defining criterion for bv, we found that the method was highly specific and sensitive for  the diagnosis of bv using microscopy as a gold standard.

AB  == background: the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. the primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as  sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. results: based on gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (bv) microflora and  that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous gram-negative and gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. on average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. the species most often found were: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus anginosus group spp., enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp., mobiluncus curtisii and bacteroides ureolyticus. lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. there was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. there was  however a highly significant correlation between the presence of e. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with m. curtisii, atopobium vaginae and gardnerella  vaginalis primer sets. conclusion: our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. it reveals a  mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a bv microflora.

TI  == gene polymorphisms of toll-like and related recognition receptors in relation to  the vaginal carriage of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae.
AB  == host genetic factors have previously been found to act as determinants of differential susceptibility to major infectious diseases. it is less clear whether such polymorphisms may also impose on pathogen recognition in mucosal overgrowth conditions such as bacterial vaginosis, an anaerobic overgrowth condition characterised by the presence of a vaginal biofilm consisting of the gram-positive anaerobes gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae. we selected  34 single nucleotide polymorphisms pertaining to 9 genes involved with toll-like  receptor-mediated pathogen recognition and/or regulation (lbp, cd14, tlr1, tlr2,  tlr4, tlr6, md2, card15 and sigirr) and assessed in a nested case-control study their putative association with bacterial vaginosis, as diagnosed by gram staining, and with the vaginal carriage of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis, as determined by species-specific pcr, among 144 pregnant women. carriage of g. vaginalis during early pregnancy was associated with the -1155a>g substitution in the promoter region of the md2 gene (p=0.041). the presence of a. vaginae during  the first half of the pregnancy was significantly associated with the cd14 intron 2 1342g>t (p=0.039), the tlr1 exon 4 743a>g (p=0.038), and the card15 exon 4 14772a>t (p=0.012) polymorphisms, and marginally significantly associated with the lbp exon13 26842c>t (p=0.056), the cd14 promoter -260c>t (p=0.052), and the tlr1 promoter -7202a>g (p=0.062) polymorphisms. however, no association between gene polymorphisms and bacterial vaginosis as such could be documented. our data  suggest that some degree of genetic susceptibility involving pathogen recognition may occur with the key bacterial vaginosis organism, a. vaginae.

TI  == molecular quantification of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae loads to  predict bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a poorly detected public health problem that is associated with preterm delivery and for which no reliable diagnostic tool exists. methods: molecular analysis of 231 vaginal samples, classified by gram stain-based nugent score, was used to propose molecular criteria for bv; these criteria were prospectively applied to 56 new samples. a quantitative molecular tool targeting 8 bv-related microorganisms and a human gene was developed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension. the targeted microorganisms were gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus species, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, and candida albicans (which can be identified by gram staining), as well as atopobium vaginae, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum (which cannot be detected by gram staining). results: with use of the nugent score, 167 samples were classified as normal, 20 were classified as bv, and 44 were classified as intermediate. except for u. urealyticum, m. mulieris, and lactobacillus species,  dna of the tested bacteria was detected more frequently in samples demonstrating  bv, but the predictive value of such detection was low. the molecular quantification of a. vaginae (dna level, > or = 10(8) copies/ml) and g. vaginalis (dna level, > or = 10(9) copies/ml) had the highest predictive value for the diagnosis of bv, with excellent sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values; 25 (57%) of the samples demonstrating intermediate flora had a bv profile. when applied prospectively, our molecular criteria had total positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 99%, respectively. conclusions: we report a highly reproducible, quantitative tool to objectively analyze vaginal flora that uses cutoff values for the concentrations of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis to establish the molecular diagnosis of bv.

TI  == atopobium vaginae triggers an innate immune response in an in vitro model of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder among women of reproductive age. the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis is poorly understood, but is defined by a transition in the vaginal flora from the predominant lactobacillus species to other bacterial species such as atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis. this change is associated with an increase in vaginal cytokine secretion. we hypothesize that vaginal epithelial cells respond to bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria by triggering an innate immune response.  we observed that vaginal epithelial cells secreted interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in response to atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis, but not to lactobacillus crispatus. atopobium vaginae induced increased levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 transcripts, as well as increased transcripts for the antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin 4. this innate immune response required live bacteria capable of protein synthesis in direct contact with vaginal epithelial cells. the response of vaginal epithelial cells was mediated by toll-like receptor 2, required the adaptor protein myd88, and involved activation of the nfkappab signaling pathway. these results suggest that atopobium vaginae stimulates an innate immune response from vaginal epithelial cells, leading to localized cytokine and defensin production, and possibly contributes to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == the human vaginal bacterial biota and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the bacterial biota of the human vagina can have a profound impact on the health  of women and their neonates. changes in the vaginal microbiota have been associated with several adverse health outcomes including premature birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, and acquisition of hiv infection. cultivation-independent molecular methods have provided new insights regarding bacterial diversity in this important niche, particularly in women with the common condition bacterial vaginosis (bv). pcr methods have shown that women with bv have complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include many fastidious species, particularly from the phyla bacteroidetes and actinobacteria. healthy women are mostly colonized with lactobacilli such as lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, and lactobacillus iners, though a variety of other bacteria may be present. the microbiology of bv is heterogeneous. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae coating the vaginal epithelium in some subjects with bv suggests that biofilms may contribute to this condition.

TI  == quantitative determination by real-time pcr of four vaginal lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between l. gasseri and l. iners.
AB  == background: most studies of the vaginal microflora have been based on culture or  on qualitative molecular techniques. here we applied existing real-time pcr formats for lactobacillus crispatus, l. gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis and developed new formats for atopobium vaginae, l. iners and l. jensenii to obtain a quantitative non culture-based determination of these species in 71 vaginal samples from 32 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years.  results: the 71 vaginal microflora samples of these women were categorized, using the ison and hay criteria, as refined by verhelst et al. (2005), as follows: grade ia: 8 samples, grade iab: 10, grade ib: 13, grade i-like: 10, grade ii: 11, grade iii: 12 and grade iv: 7.l. crispatus was found in all but 5 samples and was the most frequent lactobacillus species detected. a significantly lower concentration of l. crispatus was found in grades ii (p < 0.0001) and iii (p = 0.002) compared to grade i. l. jensenii was found in all grades but showed higher concentration in grade iab than in grade ia (p = 0.024). a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were present in high concentrations in grade iii, with log10 median concentrations (log10 mc), respectively of 9.0 and 9.2 cells/ml. twenty (38.5%) of the 52 g. vaginalis positive samples were also positive for a. vaginae. in grade ii we found almost no l. iners (log10 mc: 0/ml) but a high concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 8.7/ml). by contrast, in grade iii we found a high concentration of l. iners (log10 mc: 8.3/ml) and a low concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 0/ml). these results show a negative association between l. gasseri and l. iners (r = -0.397, p = 0.001) and between l. gasseri and a. vaginae (r = -0.408, p < 0.0001). conclusion: in our study we found a clear negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri and between a. vaginae and l. gasseri. our results do not provide support for the generally held proposition that grade ii is an intermediate stage between grades i and iii, because l. gasseri, abundant in grade ii is not predominant in grade iii, whereas l. iners,  abundant in grade iii is present only in low numbers in grade ii samples.

TI  == an adherent gardnerella vaginalis biofilm persists on the vaginal epithelium after standard therapy with oral metronidazole.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of standard treatment with oral metronidazole in the eradication of the bacterial vaginosis biofilm. study design: we conducted an interventional follow-up study in which 18 patients with bacterial vaginosis were treated with oral metronidazole during 1 week and subsequently had a single random follow-up assessment at 1-week intervals, up to 5 weeks, with 3 patients representing each point in time. follow-up assessment included conventional scoring of the vaginal microflora and  determination of bacterial biofilm characteristics on a vaginal biopsy through bacterial 16/23s recombinant dna-based fluorescence in-situ hybridization. results: although all patients recovered, we consistently observed the resurgence with treatment cessation of a dense and active bacterial biofilm on the vaginal mucosa, primarily consisting of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae. conclusion: a large reservoir of the core bacteria to bacterial vaginosis persists as a biofilm after metronidazole treatment.

TI  == rapid detection of atopobium vaginae and association with organisms implicated in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == atopobium vaginae, a fastidious, anaerobic, gram-positive cocci-shaped bacterium  that generates large quantities of lactic acid, is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). published nucleic acid amplification tests for identifying a. vaginae are directed toward the 16s ribosomal dna with suboptimal specificity and require isolation of the organism. here, sequencing of an a. vaginae genomic library has led to the development of a highly specific and sensitive real-time pcr test for detection of a. vaginae directly from gynecological cervicovaginal swab samples. the real-time pcr did not cross-react with dna extracted from other members of the atopobium genus, species with closely related 16s ribosomal dna, and a panel of 51 other human pathogens. the dna extraction and pcr assembly were amenable to automation using corbett robotics x-tractor gene and cas-4200n liquid handling systems. the real-time pcr was used to analyze 96 cervicovaginal swab samples submitted to our clinical laboratory for detection of organisms associated with bv. of those samples, 28 were positive for a. vaginae. of the 28  positive samples, 23 were concomitant with gardnerella vaginalis detection. these results suggest that further clinical study of the relationship of a. vaginae with g. vaginalis and the development of bv should be performed.

TI  == targeted pcr for detection of vaginal bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == several novel bacterial species have been detected in subjects with bacterial vaginosis (bv) by using broad-range pcr assays, but this approach is insensitive  for detecting minority species. we developed a series of taxon-directed 16s rrna  gene pcr assays for more sensitive detection of key vaginal bacteria. we sought to determine the prevalence of each species in the vagina, its association with bv, and the utility of pcr for the microbiological diagnosis of bv. targeted pcr  assays were developed for 17 vaginal bacterial species and applied to 264 vaginal-fluid samples from 81 subjects with and 183 subjects without bv. the results were compared to those of two widely accepted methods for diagnosing bv,  the use of clinical findings (amsel criteria) and the interpretation of vaginal-fluid gram stains (nugent criteria). leptotrichia/sneathia, atopobium vaginae, an eggerthella-like bacterium, megasphaera species, and three novel bacteria in the order clostridiales are among the bacterial species significantly associated with bv. pcr detection of either a megasphaera species or one of the clostridiales bacteria yielded a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 89% for  diagnosis of bv compared to the amsel clinical criteria and a sensitivity of 95.9% and a specificity of 93.7% compared to the nugent criteria (gram stain). pcr detection of one or more fastidious bacterial species is a more reliable indicator of bv than detection of bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis, previously linked to bv, highlighting the potential of pcr for the diagnosis of bv.

TI  == rapid characterization of the normal and disturbed vaginal microbiota by application of 16s rrna gene terminal rflp fingerprinting.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a prevalent infection in women of reproductive age associated with numerous sequelae, including preterm delivery, amniotic fluid infections and an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. the  vaginal microbiota in bv patients is characterized by a shift from lactobacilli to a diverse spectrum of mostly anaerobic bacteria. in this study, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) was used to characterize the vaginal bacterial communities from 50 women with bv and 20 healthy subjects. in the bv samples, 23 species or phylotypes from 17 genera could be identified, including atopobium vaginae, megasphaera sp., lactobacillus iners, gardnerella vaginalis and three recently described phylotypes from the order clostridiales. the number of detected species or phylotypes was on average 6.3 per sample (range 2-14). in contrast, in normal samples, only lactobacillus species could be identified. in conclusion, t-rflp provides a rapid and reliable technique to investigate the diversity of the predominant vaginal microbiota and allows differentiation of the flora of bv and healthy women. as such, t-rflp may be helpful both in the diagnosis of bv from vaginal fluids and in a better understanding of the bacterial succession involved in the aetiology of bv.

AB  == background: we investigated associations between atopobium vaginae and bacterial  vaginosis (bv) and the role that a. vaginae plays in recurrent bv after oral metronidazole therapy. methods: women with abnormal vaginal discharge or odor were enrolled in a cross-sectional study (n=358); the proportion of those infected with gardnerella vaginalis and a. vaginae was determined by polymerase chain reaction. women with bv (nugent score [ns] 7-10 or 4-6 with > or =3 amsel criteria; n=139) were treated with oral metronidazole (400 mg twice a day for 7 days) and examined at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months or until they reached an ns of 7-10  and recurrence of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis infection was established. results: a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were highly sensitive for bv--96% (95% confidence interval [ci], 91%-98%) and 99% (95% ci, 97%-100%), respectively. however, a. vaginalis was more specific for bv (77% [95% ci, 71%-82%]) than was g. vaginalis  (35% [95% ci, 29%-42%]). g. vaginalis was detected in 100% and a. vaginae in 75%  of women with recurrent bv; higher organism loads were present in women with recurrent bv. a. vaginae was rarely detected without g. vaginalis, and women in whom both organisms were detected had higher rates of recurrent bv (83%) than women infected with g. vaginalis only (38%) (p<.001). conclusions: infection with a. vaginae is more specific for bv than infection with g. vaginalis. the higher recurrence rates in women in whom both a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were detected  suggest that a. vaginae makes a significant contribution to bv. however, its etiological role remains unclear.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
AB  == background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2  to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and  a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole  resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on  a more limited number of strains.

TI  == throwing the dice for the diagnosis of vaginal complaints?
AB  == background: vaginitis is among the most common conditions women are seeking medical care for. although these infections can easily be treated, the relapse rate is high. this may be due to inadequate use of the diagnostic potential. methods: we evaluated the misjudgement rate of the aetiology of vaginal complaints. a total of 220 vaginal samples from women with a vaginal complaint were obtained and analysed for numbers of total lactobacilli, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, total aerobic cell counts and total anaerobic cell counts including bifidobacteria, bacteroides spp., prevotella spp. additionally, the presence of atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, candida spp. and trichomonas vaginalis  was evaluated by dna-hybridisation using the pcr and affirm vpiii microbial identification test, respectively. results: the participating physicians diagnosed bacterial vaginosis (bv) as origin of discomfort in 80 cases, candidiasis in 109 cases and mixed infections in 8 cases. however, a present bv,  defined as lack of h2o2-lactobacilli, presence of marker organisms, such as g. vaginalis, bacteroides spp. or atopobium vaginae, and an elevated ph were identified in only 45 cases of the women examined. candida spp. were detected in  46 cases. interestingly, an elevated ph corresponded solely to the presence of atopobium vaginae, which was detected in 11 cases. conclusion: errors in the diagnosis of bv and candida vulvovaginitis (cv) were high. interestingly, the cases of misjudgement of cv (77%) were more numerous than that of bv (61%). the use of amsel criteria or microscopy did not reduce the number of misinterpretations. the study reveals that the misdiagnosis of vaginal complaints is rather high.

TI  == comparison between gram stain and culture for the characterization of vaginal microflora: definition of a distinct grade that resembles grade i microflora and  revised categorization of grade i microflora.
AB  == background: the microbiological diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually made  using nugent's criteria, a useful but rather laborious scoring system based on counting bacterial cell types on gram stained slides of vaginal smears. ison and  hay have simplified the score system to three categories and added a fourth category for microflora with a predominance of the streptococcus cell type. because in the nugent system several cell types are not taken into account for a  final score, we carried out a detailed assessment of the composition of the vaginal microflora in relation to standard gram stain in order the improve the diagnostic value of the gram stain. to this purpose we compared gram stain based  categorization of vaginal smears with i) species specific pcr for the detection of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae and with ii) tdna-pcr for the identification of most cultivable species. results: a total of 515 samples were obtained from 197 pregnant women, of which 403 (78.3%) were categorized as grade  i microflora, 46 (8.9%) as grade ii, 22 (4.3%) as grade iii and 8 (1.6%) as grade iv, according to the criteria of ison and hay. another 36 samples (7.0%) were assigned to the new category 'grade i-like', because of the presence of diphtheroid bacilli cell types. we found that 52.7% of the grade i-like samples contained bifidobacterium spp. while l. crispatus was present in only 2.8% of the samples and g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were virtually absent; in addition, the species diversity of this category was similar to that of grade ii specimens.based on the presence of different lactobacillus cell types, grade i specimens were further characterized as grade ia (40.2%), grade iab (14.9%) and grade ib (44.9%). we found that this classification was supported by the finding  that l. crispatus was cultured from respectively 87.0% and 76.7% of grade ia and  iab specimens while this species was present in only 13.3% of grade ib specimens, a category in which l. gasseri and l. iners were predominant. conclusion: further refinement of gram stain based grading of vaginal smears is possible by distinguishing additional classes within grade i smears (ia, iab and ib) and by adding a separate category, designated grade i-like. a strong correlation was found between grade ia and the presence of l. crispatus and between grade i-like  and the presence of bifidobacteria. this refinement of gram stain based scoring of vaginal smears may be helpful to improve the interpretation of the clinical data in future studies, such as the understanding of response to treatment and recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in some women, and the relationship between bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth.

AB  == background: the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains largely elusive, although some microorganisms, including gardnerella vaginalis, are suspected of playing a role in the etiology of this disorder. recently culture-independent analysis of microbial ecosystems has proven its efficacy in characterizing the diversity of bacterial populations. here, we report on the results obtained by combining culture and pcr-based methods to characterize the normal and disturbed  vaginal microflora. results: a total of 150 vaginal swab samples from healthy women (115 pregnant and 35 non-pregnant) were categorized on the basis of gram stain of direct smear as grade i (n = 112), grade ii (n = 26), grade iii (n = 9)  or grade iv (n = 3). the composition of the vaginal microbial community of eight  of these vaginal swabs (three grade i, two grade ii and three grade iii), all from non-pregnant women, were studied by culture and by cloning of the 16s rrna genes obtained after direct amplification. forty-six cultured isolates were identified by tdna-pcr, 854 cloned 16s rrna gene fragments were analysed of which 156 by sequencing, yielding a total of 38 species, including 9 presumptively novel species with at least five species that have not been isolated previously from vaginal samples. interestingly, cloning revealed that atopobium vaginae was  abundant in four out of the five non-grade i specimens. finally, species specific pcr for a. vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis pointed to a statistically significant co-occurrence of both species in the bacterial vaginosis samples. conclusions: although historically the literature regarding bacterial vaginosis has largely focused on g. vaginalis in particular, several findings of this study--like the abundance of a. vaginae in disturbed vaginal microflora and the presence of several novel species--indicate that much is to be learned about the  composition of the vaginal microflora and its relation to the etiology of bv.
