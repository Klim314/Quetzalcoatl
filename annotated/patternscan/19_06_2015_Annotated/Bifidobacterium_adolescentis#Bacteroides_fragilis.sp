TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == use of accuracy profile procedure to validate a real-time pcr method to quantify  bacteria in feces.
AB  == this study describes a novel validation procedure of real-time pcr based on accuracy profile to estimate bacterial concentrations in fecal samples. to assess the performance of the method, measurements of axenic fecal samples spiked with a measured quantity of known bacterial species (bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecium, and escherichia coli) were performed under repeatability and intermediate precision conditions. data collected were used to compute a tolerance interval that was compared to a defined acceptance interval. it is concluded that the method is valid and relevant for the studied validation range of 8.20-10.24 and 7.43-9.47 log10 cfu/g of feces to ensure proper measurement of b. fragilis and e. coli, respectively. the loq is 8.20 and 7.43 log10 cfu/g of feces. in contrast, the method is not valid for the quantification of e. faecium and b. adolescentis, but by applying a correction factor of +0.63 log10 cfu/g, it can be considered valid for e. faecium. this correction is included in the final results. in conclusion, the accuracy profile is a statistical tool that is easy to use and totally adapted to validate real-time pcr.

TI  == ethnic diversity of gut microbiota: species characterization of bacteroides fragilis group and genus bifidobacterium in healthy belgian adults, and comparison with data from japanese subjects.
AB  == the composition of the human gut microbiota is related to host health, and it is  thought that dietary habits may play a role in shaping this composition. here, we examined the population size and prevalence of six predominant bacterial genera and the species compositions of genus bifidobacterium (g-bifid) and bacteroides fragilis group (g-bfra) in 42 healthy belgian adults by quantitative pcr (qpcr) over a period of one month. the population sizes and prevalence of these bacteria were basically stable throughout the study period. the predominant g-bifid species were bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum ss. longum,  and the predominant g-bfra species were bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis, and bacteroides ovatus. the belgian gut microbiota data were then compared with gut microbiota data from 46 japanese subjects collected according to the same protocol (matsuki et al., appl. environ. microbiol. 70, 167-173, 2004). the population size and prevalence of bifidobacterium catenulatum group were significantly lower in the belgian gut microbiota than in the japanese gut microbiota (p < 0.001); however, the population size and prevalence of g-bifid did not differ. this species-level qpcr analysis will be helpful for investigating the diversity of gut microbiota among ethnic groups.

TI  == intestinal bacteroides species associated with coeliac disease.
AB  == aims: to characterise the predominant species of bacterial populations associated with duodenal biopsies of paediatric patients with active and treated coeliac disease. methods: 20 biopsy specimens from patients with active coeliac disease,  12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations were analysed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. results: bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from controls than in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis/bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in controls than in patients with coeliac disease (p<0.05). bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in controls than in patients with treated coeliac disease (p<0.01). bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with active coeliac disease than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p<0.01). bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease than in controls. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis were more prevalent in patients with active coeliac disease than in patients with treated coeliac disease and control children. a higher lab diversity was found in patients with treated coeliac disease and controls than in patients with active coeliac disease. weissella spp and lactobacillus fermentum were more frequently detected  in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls and patients with active coeliac disease. conclusions: bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lab populations in the duodenum of spanish children with typical coeliac disease (active and treated) and controls differ in diversity and species composition; this could contribute to features of the disease.

TI  == interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts  were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be  influenced by the individual's microbiota.

TI  == altered early infant gut microbiota in children developing allergy up to 5 years  of age.
AB  == background: early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is postulated to protect children from allergy, while clostridium (c.) difficile colonization might be associated with allergic disease. previous studies of infant gut microbiota in relation to subsequent allergy development have mostly employed culture-dependent techniques, studied genera of bacteria and the follow-up period was limited to 2 years. objective: to relate gut microbiota in early infancy, notably bifidobacteria and lactobacilli at species level, to allergy development  during the first 5 years of life and study if environmental factors influence the early infant gut microbiota. methods: fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 47 swedish infants, followed prospectively to 5 years of age. bacterial dna was analysed with real-time pcr and related to allergy development, family size as well as endotoxin and fel d 1 levels in house dust samples. primers binding to c. difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and bacteroides fragilis were used. children regarded as  allergic manifested allergic symptoms and were skin prick test positive during their first 5 years while non-allergic children were neither. results: children who developed allergy were significantly less often colonized with lactobacilli group i (lactobacillus (l.) rhamnosus, l. casei, l. paracasei), bifidobacterium adolescentis and c. difficile during their first 2 months. infants colonized with several bifidobacterium species had been exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin and grew up in larger families than infants harbouring few species. conclusion: a more diverse gut microbiota early in life might prevent allergy development and may be related to the previously suggested inverse relationship between allergy,  family size and endotoxin exposure.

TI  == coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  == coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. the aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and  ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. while 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less  common (4% incidence). coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from bacteroides fragilis with clostridium perfringens, and bifidobacterium adolescentis with c. perfringens. oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from b. adolescentis with fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii with c. perfringens and f. nucleatum with lactobacillus paracasei. heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.

TI  == molecular monitoring of the fecal microbiota of healthy human subjects during administration of lactulose and saccharomyces boulardii.
AB  == diet is a major factor in maintaining a healthy human gastrointestinal tract, and this has triggered the development of functional foods containing a probiotic and/or prebiotic component intended to improve the host's health via modulation of the intestinal microbiota. in this study, a long-term placebo-controlled crossover feeding study in which each subject received several treatments was performed to monitor the effect of a prebiotic substrate (i.e., lactulose), a probiotic organism (i.e., saccharomyces boulardii), and their synbiotic combination on the fecal microbiota of three groups of 10 healthy human subjects  differing in prebiotic dose and/or intake of placebo versus synbiotic. for this purpose, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicons was used to detect possible changes in the overall bacterial composition using the universal v(3) primer and to detect possible changes at the subpopulation level using group-specific primers targeting the bacteroides fragilis subgroup, the genus bifidobacterium, the clostridium lituseburense group (cluster xi), and the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group (cluster xiva). although these populations remained fairly stable based on dgge profiling, one pronounced change was observed in the universal fingerprint profiles after lactulose ingestion. band position analysis and band sequencing revealed that a band appearing or intensifying following lactulose administration could be assigned to the species bifidobacterium adolescentis. subsequent analysis with real-time pcr (rt-pcr) indicated a statistically significant increase (p < 0.05)  in total bifidobacteria in one of the three subject groups after lactulose administration, whereas a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed in the other two groups. combined rt-pcr results from two subject groups indicated a borderline significant increase (p = 0.074) of b. adolescentis following lactulose intake. the probiotic yeast s. boulardii did not display any detectable universal changes in the dgge profiles, nor did it influence the bifidobacterial  levels. this study highlighted the capacity of an integrated approach consisting  of dgge analysis and rt-pcr to monitor and quantify pronounced changes in the fecal microbiota of healthy subjects upon functional food administration.

TI  == integrated analysis of established and novel microbial and chemical methods for microbial source tracking.
AB  == several microbes and chemicals have been considered as potential tracers to identify fecal sources in the environment. however, to date, no one approach has  been shown to accurately identify the origins of fecal pollution in aquatic environments. in this multilaboratory study, different microbial and chemical indicators were analyzed in order to distinguish human fecal sources from nonhuman fecal sources using wastewaters and slurries from diverse geographical areas within europe. twenty-six parameters, which were later combined to form derived variables for statistical analyses, were obtained by performing methods that were achievable in all the participant laboratories: enumeration of fecal coliform bacteria, enterococci, clostridia, somatic coliphages, f-specific rna phages, bacteriophages infecting bacteroides fragilis ryc2056 and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ga17, and total and sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria; genotyping of f-specific rna phages; biochemical phenotyping of fecal coliform bacteria and enterococci using miniaturized tests; specific detection of bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium dentium; and measurement of four fecal sterols. a number of potentially useful source indicators were detected (bacteriophages infecting b. thetaiotaomicron, certain genotypes of f-specific bacteriophages, sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria, 24-ethylcoprostanol, and epycoprostanol), although no one source identifier alone provided 100% correct classification of the fecal source. subsequently, 38 variables (both single and derived) were defined from the measured microbial and chemical parameters in order to find the best subset of variables to develop predictive models using the lowest possible number of measured parameters. to this end, several statistical or machine learning methods were evaluated and provided two successful predictive models based on just two variables, giving 100% correct classification: the ratio of the densities of somatic coliphages and phages infecting bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to the density of somatic coliphages and the ratio of the densities of fecal coliform bacteria and phages infecting bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to the density of fecal coliform bacteria. other models with high rates of correct classification were developed, but in these cases, higher numbers of variables were required.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == intestinal mucosa-associated bacteria modulate rat mast cell reactivity.
AB  == it is well known that in some conditions bacteria of physiological flora of gastrointestinal tract may become pathogenic. each complaint which causes injury  of gastrointestinal wall integrity permits bacteria to penetrate the tissues and  affect the tissue cells. since mast cells represent one of very important and numerous cellular elements of the gastrointestinal tract walls, bacteria can exert the effects on them. therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the influence of four strains of intestinal mucosa-associated bacteria--bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides fragilis, bifidobacterium adolescentis and escherichia coli on the mast cell reactivity. our experiments were performed in vitro on isolated rat peritoneal mast cells and the reactivity of these cells was estimated on the basis of histamine release. we used the suspensions of whole bacteria, killed by heating at 65 degrees c. we have noticed that the magnitude of bacteria-induced histamine release from mast cells was very low (up to 6.0%) when compared with histamine release induced with con a, compound 48/80 and tnf-alpha. however, all studied bacteria changed the reactivity of mast cells in  anaphylactic (with cona) and anaphylactoid (with compound 48/80) reactions. after 40 min preincubation with b. thetaioataomicron, b. fragilis, b. adolescentis or e. coli cona-induced histamine release was diminished up to 25%, 71%, 58% and and 68% of maximal histamine release, respectively. preincubation of rat mast cells with b. thetaioataomicron, b. fragilis, b. adolescentis or e. coli also changed their reactivity in anaphylactoid reaction with compound 48/80 (histamine release was diminished up to 70%, 63%, 63% and 60%, respectively).

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of n-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == n-acetylchitooligosaccharides ((glcnac)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. a chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using hcl. after purification, the purity of each (glcnac)(1-6) was >86%. the growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (bm) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize glcnac and (glcnac)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium limosum could use (glcnac)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (glcnac)(1-6). glcnac was used more readily than (glcnac)(2-6) by staphylococcus  aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. in bm, streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon.
AB  == the effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane (aom)-induced aberrant crypt foci (acf) and dna adducts in the rat colon was investigated. male sprague-dawley rats were administered cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens for five weeks and given injections of aom at 15 mg/kg body weight at the first and second weeks. the number of acf five weeks after the start of the experiment was decreased in the rats treated with the cultures or culture supernatants of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens. the half-life of o6-methylguanine (o6-meg) in the l. acidophilus group was shorter than that in the gam broth group. the half-life of 7-methylguanine did not differ among the groups. these results suggest that the metabolite(s) of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens inhibit(s) the acf formation in rats treated with aom and that the inhibitory effect of l. acidophilus is due to the enhanced removal of o6-meg from the colon mucosal dna.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic c3h/he  male mice.
AB  == the effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, c. paraputrificum, c. perfringens, c. innocuum, c. nexile, c. ramosum, c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides multiacidus, bacteroides fragilis, veillonella alcalescens, v. parvula, and lactobacillus acidophilus. the incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, and c. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). in contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, c. perfringens, and bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from  that in germfree animals (0.5). the present study demonstrated that the presence  of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.

TI  == [antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  == antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, bacteroides and fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with  metronidazole. in addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against p. prevotii, b. fragilis ss. fragilis and f. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in gam broth containing  of 4 mic, 2 mic, 1 mic and 1/2 mic of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. all the strains of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus including p. anaerobius, p. saccharolyticus, p. prevotii and ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of bacteroides including b. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). to this concentration all strains of fusobacterium including f. varium (20 strains), f. mortiferum (2 strains) and other fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.

TI  == experimental shigella infections in laboratory animals. i. antagonism by human normal flora components in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == germfree mice were associated with selected species of human intestinal bacteria  and then challenged with a streptomycin-resistant shigella flexneri strain. antagonism against shigella was most pronounced in mice associated with escherichia coli and least pronounced in mice associated with bacteroides fragilis. a moderate degree of antagonism could be demonstrated in mice associated with either streptococcus faecalis or bifidobacterium adolescentis. shigella persisted in the cecal contents of e. coli-associated mice at very low,  stable levels. shigella populations were reduced to levels below detection in the ceca of mice diassociated with e. coli and bacteroides. upon subsequent administration of streptomycin, bacteroides disappeared from the ceca. the e. coli population was greatly reduced, and shigella reappeared at very high population levels as an apparent recombinant which resembled e. coli biochemically. a streptomycin-resistant e. coli population subsequently emerged and became dominant in the ceca. shigella concomitantly declined to levels below  detection.
