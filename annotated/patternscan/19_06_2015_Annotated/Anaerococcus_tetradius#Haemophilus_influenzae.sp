TI  == nationwide surveillance of 6 otorhinolaryngological infectious diseases and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in the isolated pathogens in japan.
AB  == the japanese three academic societies joint antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance committee has conducted a nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and rates of isolation in 6 otolaryngological diseases. the surveillance program was conducted in the otorhinolaryngological departments  of 29 universities, and their 26 affiliated hospitals. patients suffering from acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, acute nasal sinusitis, chronic nasal sinusitis, acute tonsillitis, and peritonsillar abscess between january 2011 and  june 2012 were investigated. the collected swab or incision samples were cultivated for microbial identification, and the drug susceptibility of detected  bacteria was measured at the kitasato university research center for infections and antimicrobials. the surveillance focused on three gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus), three gram-negative bacteria (haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three anaerobic bacteria (peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., and fusobacterium spp.). bacterial susceptibility to 39 antimicrobial drugs was investigated. we compared bacterial isolation ratio of each disease in this surveillance from those of past 4 times surveillance which we performed formerly, and we also compared percentage of main drug resistant strains from those of past 4 times surveillance. the age composition between this time and former surveillances was not statistically significant by student-t test. we were unable to completely resolve the rise in resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase non-producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, beta-lactamase producing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae, and beta-lactamase producing amoxicillin clavulanic acid-resistant h. influenzae. we suggest promoting the proper usage of antimicrobial drugs in order to avoid the spread of these bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == complications of adenotonsillectomy: a case report of meningitis due to dual infection with nontypeable haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae, and a prospective study of the rate of postoperative bacteremia.
AB  == case report: bacterial meningitis is a rare complication of adenotonsillectomy. we present a case of meningitis due to nontypeable haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae after adenotonsillectomy. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns indicated that the oral cavity was the source of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. blood culture study: as bacteremia is thought to be one of the etiologies of meningitis, we prospectively investigated the rate of bacteremia as a complication of adenotonsillectomy. of the 46 patients included in the study, mean age of five years old, 11 (24%) had positive blood cultures during the operation. h. influenzae was the commonest organism grown (seven cultures), three of seven produced beta-lactamase, followed by s. pneumoniae (one culture), h. parainfluenzae (one culture), peptostreptococcus micros (one culture), and veillonella spp. (one culture). the bacteria were composed of tonsil or adenoid surface cultures in eight of 11 patients (73%). conclusions: we present a rare case of meningitis complicating a adenotonsillectomy procedure, in a three years  old boy. meningitis is a rare complication of adenotonsillectomy, but bacteremia  which may lead to meningitis occurs frequently, as the results.

TI  == sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  == sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. it is approved in japan for use  in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococcus spp., enterococcus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus spp., morganella morganii, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., fusobacterium spp., chlamydia trachomatis, chlamydophila pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae. in terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in  otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, c. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin  recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.

TI  == bacteriological findings and antimicrobial resistance in odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == the main objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of chronic maxillary sinusitis of dental origin, and to evaluate the microbiology of odontogenic and non-odontogenic chronic maxillary sinusitis. aspirates from 59 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis (47 non-odontogenic, 12 odontogenic), collected during a 3-year period, were microbiologically processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. moreover, antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated in the isolated bacteria. in this study, 20 % of chronic maxillary sinusitis cases were associated with a dental origin, and sinus lift procedures were the main aetiological factor. our microbiological findings showed that all specimens from  chronic maxillary sinusitis were polymicrobial. sixty aerobes and 75 anaerobes were recovered from the 47 cases of non-odontogenic sinusitis (2.9 bacteria per specimen); 15 aerobes and 25 anaerobes were isolated from the 12 patients with odontogenic sinusitis (3.3 bacteria per specimen). the predominant aerobes were staphylococcus aureus (27) and streptococcus pneumoniae (16), while the more frequent anaerobes were peptostreptococcus species (31) and prevotella species (30). haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were absent in sinusitis associated with a dental origin. overall, 22 % of staphylococcus aureus isolates  were oxacillin-resistant, and 75 % of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant; 21 % of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria were penicillin-resistant, and 44 % of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were beta-lactamase-positive. vancomycin and quinopristin-dalfopristin had the highest in vitro activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus species, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefotaxime showed the highest in vitro activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria; and moxifloxacin, metronidazole and clindamycin were the most active against anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == microbiology of sinusitis.
AB  == most sinus infections are viral, and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses are the most common causes of sinusitis. the most common bacteria isolated from pediatric and adult patients with community-acquired acute purulent sinusitis are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria (prevotella  and porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.) are the main isolates in chronic sinusitis. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other aerobic and facultative gram-negative rods are commonly isolated from patients with nosocomial sinusitis, the immunocompromised host, those with hiv infection, and in cystic fibrosis. fungi and pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common isolates in neutropenic patients. the microbiology of sinusitis is influenced by the previous antimicrobial therapy, vaccinations, and the presence of normal flora capable of interfering with the growth of pathogens.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == microbiology of acute complicated bacterial sinusitis at the university of the witwatersrand.
AB  == design: a retrospective chart review study at two referral hospitals identified 226 consecutive surgical patients with acute complicated sinusitis. subjects: one hundred and fifty-nine male and 67 female patients, with a mean age of 16.5 (standard deviation 0.7) years, underwent external fronto-ethmoidectomy with maxillary sinus washout and 13 had a concurrent craniotomy. results: a total of 233 micro-organisms were isolated from 163 patients(72.1%), and 63 (27.9%) were culture-negative. positive isolates included streptococcus milleri (18.5%), staphylococcus aureus (12.4%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (10.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.6%), haemophilus influenzae (8.6%) and the anaerobes, peptostreptococcus (6.4%) and prevotella (4.7%) species. the prevalences of s. pneumoniae (2.6%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (1.3%) and moraxella catarrhalis (0.4%) were low. polymicrobial disease was present in 56 patients (34.4%). there was a significant difference between the two hospitals in the prevalences of some bacteria (p<0.05). antibiotic resistance was highest towards the penicillins (64.3%) and cephalosporins (12.5%). effective empiric treatment was achieved with metronidazole and a choice of amoxicillin-clavulanate or ampicillin plus cloxacillin or penicillin plus chloramphenicol. conclusion: the polymicrobial nature and severity of complicated sinusitis warrants a de-escalation approach to antimicrobial therapy. the combination of beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins and metronidazole is a reasonable choice for initial empiric antibacterial therapy. selection of drugs for empirical antibiotic therapy in patients with acute complicated sinusitis should be supported by knowledge of the local prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients.

TI  == the bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. however, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include:  anaerobic gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas); fusobacterium spp; and peptostreptococcus spp. in addition, streptococcus spp (including streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have been reported. aerobic and facultative  gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are haemophilus influenzae, treponema pallidum, bartonella henselae, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. the choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.

TI  == the effects of treatment of acute otitis media with a low dose vs a high dose of  amoxicillin on the nasopharyngeal flora.
AB  == objective: to compare the effects on the nasopharyngeal flora of therapy of acute otitis media in children with either a low dose or a high dose of amoxicillin. design: retrospective study. patients: of 50 children diagnosed as having acute otitis media, 25 received a low dose of amoxicillin (45 mg/kg/d) (group 1) and 25 received a high dose of amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d) (group 2) for 10 days, and both  groups were evaluated. intervention: antimicrobial treatment. results: before therapy, potential pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus) were isolated from the nasopharynx of 15 children in group 1 (60%) and 13 in group 2 (52%). the number of penicillin-susceptible isolates was equally reduced after both therapies. however, an increase was noted in the recovery of s aureus only in group 2 (from  2 to 6 organisms). a greater eradication rate of interfering organisms following  therapy was noted in group 2 (from 86 to 36) than in group 1 (from 92 to 60) (p < .001). these organisms include alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and peptostreptococcus and prevotella species. conclusions: the oral flora at the end of therapy with a high dose of amoxicillin is more depleted of organisms with interfering capability than following treatment with a low dose of amoxicillin. these changes may contribute to the greater recovery rate of patients infected with s aureus who received a high dose of amoxicillin.

TI  == the bacteriology of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps.
AB  == objective: to compare the bacteriologic findings in ethmoidal biopsy specimens and nasal lavage samples from healthy control patients and from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (crs) with nasal polyps (crsnp+) and without nasal polyps  (crsnp-). design: comparative microbiologic investigation. setting: university hospital. patients: the study included 31 crsnp+ patients, 13 crsnp- patients, and 21 control patients. intervention: aerobe and anaerobe bacterial culture of nasal lavage samples and biopsy specimens of anterior ethmoidal mucosa. main outcome measure: analysis of biopsy specimens from 65 patients and nasal lavage samples from 63 patients. results: mixed cultures of aerobe and anaerobe bacteria were mainly detected in the biopsy specimens. the most common aerobe bacteria found in the biopsy specimens were coagulase-negative staphylococci, corynebacterium species, staphylococcus aureus, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci. propionibacterium and peptostreptococcus species were the most common anaerobes.  pathogenic bacteria such as s. aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae were detected in biopsy specimens from 16 of 31 crsnp+ patients (52%), 4 of 13 crsnp- patients (31%), and 10 of 21 control patients (48%). there were no significant differences in the bacterial cultures of the biopsy specimens between the 3 patient groups (p >.30). the majority of bacteria detected in the biopsy specimens were also detected in the corresponding lavage samples; however, in 35% of patients, pathogenic bacteria were found only in nasal lavage samples and not  in corresponding biopsy specimens. conclusions: there are no significant differences in the bacteriologic features of ethmoidal biopsy specimens between crsnp+, crsnp-, and control patients. therefore, a bacteriologic pathogenesis of  the polyps in crsnp+ patients seems unlikely. the general use of antibiotics in patients with crs appears questionable. investigation of nasal lavage samples is  not suitable for predicting the bacteriologic features of inflamed sinuses of patients with crs.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == effect of smoking cessation on the microbial flora.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of smoking cessation on the frequency of recovery of potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic interfering bacteria in the nasopharynges of smokers. design: nasopharyngeal cultures were taken from 20  smokers before and 12 to 15 months after cessation of smoking. potential pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. results: eleven potential pathogens (0.92 pathogens per subject) were isolated from nasopharyngeal cultures obtained  from 9 individuals before smoking cessation, and 2 (0.17 per subject) were recovered from 2 individuals after smoking cessation (p < .05). bacterial interference between 2 aerobic (alpha and nonhemolytic streptococci) and 2 anaerobic species (prevotella and peptostreptococcus species) and 4 potential pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes) was observed. bacterial interference was noted in 35 instances against the 4 potential pathogens by 14 normal flora isolates that were recovered from the smokers before cessation and in 116 instances by 42 isolates after cessation (p < .01). conclusion: to our knowledge, these findings illustrate for the first time that the high number of pathogens and low number of interfering organisms found in the nasopharynx of smokers revert to normal levels after complete cessation of smoking.

TI  == human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  == telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following  single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the  median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. against two azithromycin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (mic=0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. all three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin mic=4.0 microg/ml). both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (finegoldia [peptostreptococcus] magna peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella bivia, and prevotella melaninogenica). moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both prevotella species. in this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of h. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. these findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.

TI  == bacteriology of chronic sinusitis and acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  == objective: to establish the microbiological characteristics of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (aecs). setting: academic medical center. patients: thirty-two patients with chronic sinusitis and 30 patients with aecs. main outcome measure: the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of maxillary aecs and chronic maxillary sinusitis. results: a total of 81 isolates (33 aerobic and 48 anaerobic) were recovered from the 32 cases (2.5 per specimen) with chronic sinusitis. aerobes alone were recovered in 8 specimens (25%), anaerobes only were isolated in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 13 (41%). the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus. the predominant anaerobic bacteria were peptostreptococcus subspecies, fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and propionibacterium acnes. twenty-one beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 17 specimens (53%). a total of 89 isolates (40 aerobic and facultatives, and 49 anaerobic) were recovered from the 30 patients (3.0 per specimen) with aecs. aerobes were recovered in 8 instances (27%), anaerobes only  in 11 (37%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 11 (37%). the predominant aerobes were streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae, and s aureus. the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus subspecies, fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and p acnes. thirty-six beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 28 specimens (53%). conclusions: this study demonstrates that the organisms isolated from patients with aecs were predominantly anaerobic and were similar to those generally recovered in patients with chronic sinusitis. however, aerobic bacteria that are usually found in acute infections (eg, s pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis) can also emerge in some of the episodes of aecs.

TI  == evaluation of 4 swab transport systems for the recovery of atcc and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  == despite limitations of swab transport systems (sts), many clinical samples and bacterial isolates are sent on these devices. we evaluated the performance of 4 commercial sts: m40 transystem (s1, copan italia, bovezzo, italy), uni-ter (s2, meus, piove di sacco, italy), euromed (s3, lab service, surbo, italy), and eurotubo (s4, deltalab, rubi, spain). survival of atcc and clinical strains with  characterized resistance mechanisms, stored at room temperature and using the roll-plate method (nccls m40-a) after holding times of 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, was assessed. after 24 h, only s1 was able to maintain streptococcus  pneumoniae (atcc 6305), haemophilus influenzae (10211), and neisseria meningitidis (13090) viability with a percentage range of recovery with respect to the baseline count at zero time of 104-184%. neisseria gonorrhoeae (43069) was uncultivable after 6 h with all sts except s1 (46% recovery). eighteen percent recovery after 24 h and 7% after 6 h was observed for fusobacterium nucleatum (25586) and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (27337), respectively, but only with s1. resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates do not affect survival with any of the sts.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mic90 of mepm for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. mepm were active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (ipm) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (87.9%). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in proteus mirabilis. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which mic90 of  mepm was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in  conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful  carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == [two cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and  haemophilus influenzae].
AB  == most of bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. however, we have encountered two very interesting cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. in the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (cfdn), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered.  the treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. microbiological examination of pus revealed the  presence of streptococcus pneumoniae and finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated s. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp). after an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in the second case, after an incision and drainage of bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (ampc), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. the treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. however, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of haemophilus influenzae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated h. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae (blnar). after performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, cftm-pi, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in addition, the analysis of these two cases using pk/pd theory revealed that the time above mic reached 100% with administration of cftm-pi 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. there are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. in addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on pk/pd theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.

TI  == microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  == objectives: we undertook to evaluate the microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (aecs). methods: repeated aspirations of maxillary sinus secretions by endoscopy were performed in 7 patients over a period of 125 to 242  days. results: bacteria were recovered for all 22 aspirates, and the number of isolates was between 2 and 4. a total of 54 isolates were isolated: 16 aerobic and facultative bacteria and 38 anaerobic bacteria. the aerobic bacteria were haemophilus influenzae (7 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (3), moraxella catarrhalis (3), staphylococcus aureus (2), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1). the anaerobic bacteria included pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp (19), peptostreptococcus spp (9), fusobacterium spp (8), and propionibacterium acnes (2). a change in the types of isolates was noted in all consecutive cultures obtained from the same patients as different organisms emerged and previously isolated bacteria were no longer recovered. an increase in antimicrobial resistance was noted in 6 instances. conclusions: this study illustrates the microbial dynamics of aecs in which anaerobic and aerobic bacteria prevail, and highlights the importance of obtaining cultures from patients with aecs for guidance in selection of proper antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == recovery of potential pathogens and interfering bacteria in the nasopharynx of smokers and nonsmokers.
AB  == background: active smoking and passive exposure to cigarette smoke are associated with colonization by some potentially pathogenic species of bacteria and an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in both adults and children. in an  attempt to explain these observations, this study compared the frequency of isolation of potential pathogens, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that possess interfering capabilities (ie, interfering with the in vitro growth of potential pathogens) in the nasopharynx of smokers to their recovery in nonsmokers. methods: nasopharyngeal specimens for cultures were taken from 20 smokers and 20  nonsmokers. potential pathogens, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with interfering capabilities against these organisms were identified. results: fourteen potential pathogens (0.7 per patient) were isolated from nasopharyngeal  cultures obtained from 11 of the 20 smokers, and 4 (0.2 per patient) were recovered from 3 of the 20 nonsmokers (p < 0.01). in vitro bacterial interference between two aerobic (alpha-hemolytic and nonhemolytic streptococci) and two anaerobic species (prevotella and peptostreptococcus species), and four potential pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae [non-type b], moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pyogenes) was observed. bacterial interference was noted in 61 instances against the four potential pathogens by 22 normal flora isolates that were recovered from the group of smokers, and in 155 instances by 50 isolates from the group of nonsmokers (p < 0.01). conclusions: these findings illustrate for the first time that the nasopharyngeal flora of smokers contains fewer aerobic and anaerobic organisms with interfering capabilities and more potential pathogens compared with those of nonsmokers.

TI  == bacteriology of chronic dacryocystitis in a tertiary eye care center.
AB  == purpose: to determine the current bacteriology of adult chronic dacryocystitis in a tertiary eye care center and compare it with previously reported studies. methods: clinical and microbiological records of patients with diagnosis of chronic dacryocystitis between january 1999 and march 2002 were reviewed for age, sex, lacrimal sac side involved, and culture results. patients younger than 16 years of age and patients who were receiving any systemic or topical antibiotics  were excluded from the study. results: one hundred eighty-eight adult patients with an average age of 50.5 years (range, 16 to 91 years), who had a diagnosis of chronic dacryocystitis, were identified. the study was predominated by female subjects (65.4%). of the cultures from the nasolacrimal sac, 183 (97.3%) were positive for bacteria, with an average of 2.3 (1 to 6) microorganisms. more than  2 microorganisms were present in 66.1% of the cultures, whereas a single microorganism was recovered from 33.9% of the cultures. the majority of microorganisms in our study were gram-positive bacteria, representing 53.7% of the overall microorganisms cultured with a predominance of staphylococcus species. gram-negative bacteria were recovered from 26.0% of the specimens with predominance of haemophilus influenzae. anaerobic microorganisms were present in  19.1% of the samples. the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms were  propionibacterium acne and peptostreptococcus species. conclusions: several bacterial species may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic dacryocystitis in adults, and the majority of patients harbor multiple microorganisms in their nasolacrimal sacs. the high rate of microorganism-positive lacrimal sac cultures  suggests that adult patients should be treated for their infection before any intraocular surgery because of the potential risk of infection.

TI  == microbiology and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal abscesses in children. predominant anaerobic organisms isolated in peritonsillar, lateral pharyngeal, and retropharyngeal abscesses are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium and peptostreptococcus spp.; aerobic organisms are group a streptococcus ( streptococcus pyogenes ), staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae . anaerobic bacteria can be isolated from most abscesses whenever appropriate techniques for their cultivation have been used, while s. pyogenes is isolated in only about one third of cases. more than two thirds of deep neck abscesses contain beta-lactamase producing organisms. management of tonsillar, peritonsillar, and retropharyngeal abscesses is similar. systemic antimicrobial therapy should be given in large doses whenever the diagnosis is made. however, when pus is formed, antimicrobial therapy is effective only in conjunction with adequate surgical drainage. untreated abscesses can rupture spontaneously into the pharynx, causing catastrophic aspiration. other complications are extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through facial planes and the prevertebral space. death can occur from aspiration, airway obstruction, erosion into major blood vessels, or extension to the mediastinum.

TI  == microbial dynamics of purulent nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  == this review presents the microbiological dynamic and therapeutic options in the management of purulent nasopharyngitis (npt). the nasopharynx (np) of healthy children is generally colonized by relatively non-pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic organisms, some of, which possess the ability to interfere with the growth of potential pathogens. conversely, carriage of potential respiratory aerobic pathogen such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, as well as some anaerobic bacteria (peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium and prevotella spp.) increases during purulent npt. the development of purulent npt in children is associated with the pre-existing colonization by potential pathogens and the absence of interfering organisms in the np. controversy exists regarding the management of npt as no conclusive evidence exists to date that the administration of antimicrobials will shorten the illness.

TI  == increased antimicrobial resistance in organisms recovered from otitis media with  effusion.
AB  == previous studies concerning the microbiology of otitis media with effusion (ome)  did not correlate the past use of antimicrobial agents with the recovered organism's antimicrobial susceptibility. a retrospective analysis of cultures obtained from aspirates of 129 children with ome was performed. the study identified the isolated organisms and determined their susceptibility to the most recently administered antimicrobials. bacterial growth was noted in 58 (45 per cent) patients. aerobic organisms only were recovered in 37 aspirates (63 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in seven (12 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 14 (24 per cent). a total of 92 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.6 isolates per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.5 anaerobes). there were a total of 66 aerobic isolates, including haemophilus influenzae non type-b (20 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (17), and staphylococcus spp. (seven). twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. (eight each) and propionibacterium acnes (four). resistance to the antimicrobial used was found in 60 (65 per cent) isolates, recovered from 41 (71 per cent) of the patients. of the 41 patients in whom resistance was detected, 37 (90 per cent) had been treated within three months of culture and four (10 per cent) had completed treatment more than three months before the cultures were taken (p < 0.01). the highest rate of recovery of resistant organisms was following trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (96 per cent), amoxycillin (71 per cent), and azithromycin (56 per cent). of the patients treated with amoxycillin, h influenzae predominated. s pneumoniae was recovered from four of the seven (57 per cent) after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, four of 14 (29 per cent) following amoxycillin, and three of 11 (27 per cent) after azithromycin. the data illustrate the relationship between resistance to the antimicrobials given to children and their recovery from the middle ear of patients with ome.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

AB  == the current review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria in children. staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae type-b, and group a streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, kingela kingae, neisseria meningiditis and salmonella spp are the predominant aerobic bacteria that cause arthritis in children. gonococcal arthritis can occur in sexually active adolescents. the predominant aerobes causing osteomyelitis in children are s. aureus, h. influenzae type-b, gram-negative enteric bacteria, beta-hemolytic streptococci, s. pneumoniae, k. kingae, bartonella henselae and borrelia burgdorferi. anaerobes have rarely been  reported as a cause of these infections in children. the main anaerobes in arthritis include anaerobic gram negative bacilli including bacteroides fragilis  group, fusobacterium spp., clostridium spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis, in contrast to anaerobic osteomyelitis, involved a single isolate. most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis are secondary to hematogenous spread. many patients with osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria have evidence of anaerobic infection elsewhere in the body, which is the source of the organisms involved in osteomyelitis. treatment of arthritis and osteomyelitis involving anaerobic bacteria includes symptomatic therapy, immobilization in some cases, adequate drainage of purulent material and antibiotic therapy effective to these organisms.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of suppurative sialadenitis.
AB  == aspirates of pus from acute suppurative sialadenitis were investigated for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 47 specimens, 32 from parotid, 9 from submandibular and 6 from sublingual glands yielded bacterial growth. fifty five isolates, 25 aerobic and 30 anaerobic, were isolated from parotid infection: anaerobic bacteria only were detected in 13 (41%) specimens, aerobic or facultative bacteria only in 11 (34%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic  bacteria in 8 (25%). of a total of 17 isolates, 8 aerobic and 9 anaerobic, from submandibular gland infection: anaerobic bacteria only were detected in 3 (33%) specimens, aerobic or facultative bacteria only in 4 (44%) and mixed aerobic and  anaerobic bacteria in 2 (22%). ten isolates, 5 aerobic and 5 anaerobic, were from sublingual gland infection: anaerobic bacteria only were detected in 2 (33%) specimens, aerobic or facultative bacteria only in 2 (33%) and mixed aerobic and  anaerobic bacteria in 2 (33%). the predominant aerobes were staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae while the predominant anaerobes were gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp., and fusobacterium spp.) and peptostreptococcus spp. the study highlights the polymicrobial nature and importance of anaerobic bacteria in acute suppurative sialadenitis.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == bacteriology of adenoids and tonsils in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.
AB  == adenoids and tonsils electively removed from 25 children with a history of recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs) adenotonsillitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. two hundred twenty-four organisms (112 aerobes and facultatives, 110 anaerobes, and 2 candida albicans) were isolated from the tonsils, and 229 (111 aerobes and facultatives and 118 anaerobes) were isolated from the adenoids. mixed infection was present in all instances, with an average of 9.1 isolates per specimen. the predominant aerobes  were streptococcus sp, haemophilus influenzae, and gabhs, and the prevalent anaerobes were peptostreptococcus, prevotella, and fusobacterium spp. beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 72 isolates recovered from 22  tonsils (88%) and in 74 isolates recovered from 21 adenoids (84%). discrepancies  in the organisms recovered were found between the tonsils and adenoids. of the aerobic isolates, 20% were isolated only in tonsils and 18% only in adenoids. of  the anaerobes, 20% were found only in tonsils and 26% only in adenoids. this study demonstrates a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora in both adenoids and tonsils, and discrepancies in recovery of pathogens such as gabhs. the adenoids may serve as a potential source of tonsillitis caused by gabhs.

TI  == bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == objectives: to assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (bl) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (aecb). methods: the microbiology, bl production by the different isolates, and bl contents in the sputum were determined. results: eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). the predominant aerobic isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), haemophilus influenzae (11), moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (19), prevotella sp. (11), and fusobacterium sp.(6). mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. the predominant aerobic blpb were h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobic blpb were prevotella sp. and fusobacterium sp. beta-lactamase activity  was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which blpb were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor blpb. conclusions: the rapid detection of bl activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with aecb.

TI  == [pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin (zithromac), a novel 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent].
AB  == azithromycin (zithromac), a 15-membered ring macrolide antibacterial agent, was approved to be manufactured in japan in march 2000. it showed good in vitro and/or in vivo antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, peptostreptococcus micros, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydia pneumoniae. its activity against h. influenzae was particularly more potent than that of currently used macrolide antibacterial agents. after oral administration to patients, azithromycin was readily absorbed and became widely distributed throughout the body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and phagocytic cells than in serum or plasma. its distribution into phagocytes was as high as more than 10 times that of erythromycin, and azithromycin was readily released from phagocytes in the presence of s. aureus. in experimentally infected mice, the concentration of azithromycin was higher in infected tissues than in uninfected tissues, which indicated that azithromycin was selectively delivered to infected tissues by migrating phagocytes. these pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties were reflected in good clinical results for the treatment of respiratory infections and other infections with once daily dosing for 3 days.

TI  == dynamics of nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  == purpose: our goal was to characterize the dynamics and bacterial interaction of the aerobic and anaerobic flora of nasal discharge of children at different stages of uncomplicated nasopharyngitis. methods and patients: serial semiquantitative nasopharyngeal (np) and quantitative nasal discharge (nd) cultures were taken every 3 to 5 days from 20 children in whom purulent discharge eventually developed (group 1), and a single culture was obtained from a group of 20 who had only clear discharge (group 2). results: aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all np cultures. bacterial growth was present in 8 (40%) nds of group 2. only 7 (35%) of the clear nds of group 1 showed bacterial growth; the number increased to 14 (70%) at the mucoid stage and 20 (100%) at the purulent stage. it declined to 6 (30%) at the final clear stage. the number of species and total number of organisms increased in the nds of group 1. group 1 patients had higher recovery rates of streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae in their np cultures than group 2 patients (p < 0.05). during the purulent stage, peptostreptococcus species were isolated in 15 (75%), fusobacterium species in 10 (50%), prevotella species in 9 (45%), h influenzae in 8 (40%), s pneumoniae in 6 (30%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci in 5 (25%) of group 1 nds. this was higher than their recovery in the clear stages of both groups and the mucoid stage of group 1. a total of 8 organisms capable of interfering with the growth of potential pathogens were isolated from the nps of  group 1, as compared with 35 from group 2 (p < 0.001). conclusions: the development of purulent nasopharyngitis is associated with the pre-existing presence of potential pathogens and the absence of interfering organisms.

(5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

(7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

AB  == we observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985,  1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified  in 254 among the 266 patients. their ages were less than 3 months after birth in  50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. the  causative organisms were h. influenzae in 134 patients and s. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. next to the above bacteria ranked s. agalactiae in 29 and e. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. l. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and n. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. s. pyogenes, enterococcus spp., peptostreptococcus spp., p. mirabilis and enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. the causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. h. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but s. pneumoniae  exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. there was a decreasing tendency with s. agalactiae and e. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. however, panipenem (phonetic) is  likely to be effective for insensible s. pneumoniae for the time being.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin against recent obtained clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activities of clarithromycin (cam), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cam and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates that were obtained from outpatients in 1994 and 1996. the results are summarized as follows; 1. it was not showed that cam-resistant strains were increasing among staphylococcus spp., beta-streptococci, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis, campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni, chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma pneumoniae. it appeared that resistances to cam and macrolides (mls) were increasing among streptococcus pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the drug susceptibility patterns to mls were similar and detection frequencies of induced  resistant strains that were resistant to only 14-membered ring mls including cam  and constitutive resistant strains that were resistant to 14 and 16-membered ring mls were high among streptococcus pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp. it appears that mls-resistance systems are linked to each other, and that this was a cause of increasing mls-resistance among these bacterial species. 3. notwithstanding of antibiotic resistance problems, cam is still useful since it maintains strong antimicrobial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, b. pertussis, c. jejuni subsp. jejuni, c. trachomatis and m. pneumoniae, and it controls arginate producing abilities of mucoide strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == cloning and expression of the two genes coding for l-serine dehydratase from peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus: relationship of the iron-sulfur protein to both l-serine dehydratases from escherichia coli.
AB  == the structural genes sdha and sdhb, coding for the alpha- and beta-subunits of the [4fe-4s] cluster containing l-serine dehydratase from peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, have been cloned and sequenced. expression of modified sdhb together with sdha in escherichia coli led to overproduction of active his6-tagged l-serine dehydratase. e. coli mew22, deficient in the l-serine dehydratase l-sd1, was complemented by this sdhba construct. the derived amino acid sequence of sdhba shares similarities with both monomeric l-serine dehydratases, l-sd1 and l-sd2, from e. coli and with a putative l-serine dehydratase from haemophilus influenzae, which suggests that these three enzymes  are also iron-sulfur proteins.

TI  == immune response to fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and other anaerobes in children with acute tonsillitis.
AB  == the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-gabhs tonsillitis. antibody titres to four gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. an average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in gabhs tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-gabhs tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. there were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both gabhs  and non-gabhs groups. these bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, peptostreptococcus spp., f. nucleatum, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. significantly higher antibodies levels to  f. nucleatum and p. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients  with non-gabhs pharyngo-tonsillitis (p < 0.001) and gabhs tonsillitis (p < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. the  increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-gabhs and gabhs tonsillitis.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of bacterial tracheitis in children.
AB  == study objectives: establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of bacterial tracheitis in children. method: retrospective review of specimens obtained from 14 children with bacterial tracheitis that were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. results: a total 30 bacterial isolates were recovered, 17 aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 13 anaerobic. aerobic bacteria only were present in six (43%) specimens, anaerobes only in three (21%), and mixed aerobic  and anaerobic flora in five (36%). polymicrobial flora was recovered in 10 of the 14 specimens. the predominant organisms were staphylococcus aureus (5 isolates),  haemophilus influenzae type b (4), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas (4), fusobacterium sp. (2), and moraxella catarrhalis (2). two organisms that were also isolated from the tracheal aspirates were recovered from the blood of two patients (one each of h. influenzae and prevotella intermedia). eleven beta-lactamase-producing organisms  were isolated from nine patients. these included all isolates of s. aureus and m. catarrhalis, and two each of h. influenzae and prevotella sp. conclusions: these  data confirm the predominance of s. aureus and h. influenzae in causing bacterial tracheitis in children and suggest a potential role for anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == in children, sinusitis is a common, generally uncomplicated, and self limiting disease which drops with age. the diagnosis is difficult because of relatively non specific signs and symptoms that overlap with viral upper respiratory infection and allergy. plain paranasal sinus radiographs are not adequate, in determining the extent of involvement in recurrent or chronic sinusitis and so ct scan has become the standard. viral illness appears to be the most common predisposing factor. immune defects (mainly ig2 and iga) may exist in a significant percentage of children. the role of allergy seems less important. with advances in the genetic field of cystic fibrosis, genetic factors are advocated in chronic or recurrent sinusitis. the most common bacterial pathogens  in pediatric sinusitis patients are sp (streptococcus pneumoniae), hi (hemophilus influenza) and mc (moraxella catarrhalis). other less frequent bacterial species  include group a streptococcus, group c streptococcus, streptococcus viridans, peptostreptococcus, moraxella species and eikenella corrodens. respiratory anaerobes are not common. antibiotics resistant to the action of the beta-lactamase are the cornerstone in medical treatment. in recurrent acute sinusitis prophylactic antimicrobials may be helpful. the indication for surgery  remains controversial. to date, we have no prospective studies comparing surgical to medical therapy in order to guide us in deciding surgical indication. it is therefore recommended to follow a conservative track and to limit surgical procedures in children with suppurative complications, nasal obstruction from polyposis or refractory sinusitis aggravating chronic pulmonary disease such as asthma.

TI  == microbiology of the transition from acute to chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == repeated aspirations of sinus secretions by endoscopy was performed in five patients over a period of 34-50 days and, ultimately, surgical drainage was done  in three who presented with acute maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and became chronic. the aspirates were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. most of the bacteria isolated from the first culture were aerobic or facultative bacteria: streptococcus pneumoniae (three isolates), haemophilus influenzae non-type-b (two) and moraxella catarrhalis (one). three of these cultures yielded bacteria that were resistant to the antimicrobial agents prescribed for treatment. failure to respond to therapy was associated with the emergence of resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in subsequent aspirates. these organisms included fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. eradication of the infection was achieved in all instances following the administration of antimicrobial agents effective against these bacteria, and in three instances by surgical drainage. this study illustrates the microbial dynamics of maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy.

AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
AB  == gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326  had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

TI  == bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == objective: to assess the bacteriology and beta-lactamase enzyme activity in aspirates of 10 acutely and 13 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses. results: the predominant organisms isolated in acute sinusitis were streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis, and those found in chronic sinusitis were prevotella species, fusobacterium species, and peptostreptococcus species. four beta-lactamase-producing organisms (blpos) were  isolated in four specimens (40%) obtained from acutely inflamed sinuses, and 14 blpos were recovered from 10 chronically inflamed sinuses (77%). the predominant  blpos in acute sinusitis were h influenzae, and m catarrhalis; those in chronic sinusitis were staphylococcus aureus, prevotella species, fusobacterium species,  and bacteroides fragilis. conclusions: beta-lactamase activity was detected in 12 (three in acute and nine in chronic sinusitis) of the 14 aspirates that contained blpos. the detection of beta-lactamase activity in sinus aspirates provides support for the role of blpos in the failure of penicillin therapy in sinusitis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == changes in the core tonsillar bacteriology of recurrent tonsillitis: 1977-1993.
AB  == microbiological studies of the core of tonsils removed from children with recurrent tonsillitis due to group a beta-hemolytic streptococci were conducted during three periods, with 50 patients in each period: 1977-1978 (period 1), 1984-1985 (period 2), and 1992-1993 (period 3). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, with 8.1 organisms per tonsil (3.8 aerobes and 4.3 anaerobes). the predominant isolates in each period were staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, peptostreptococcus species, pigmented prevotella species, porphyromonas species, and fusobacterium species. the rate of recovery of haemophilus influenzae type b increased from 24% in period 1 to 76% in period 2 (p < .001); a decline to 12% in period 3 correlated with a concomitant increase in the frequency of recovery of non-type b strains of h. influenzae from 4% and 10% in periods 1 and 2, respectively, to 64% in period 3 (p < .001). both the rate of recovery of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and the number of these organisms per tonsil increased over time. specifically, beta-lactamase-producing  strains were detected in 37 tonsils (74%) during period 1, in 46 tonsils (92%) during period 2, and in 47 tonsils (94%) during period 3, and the number of such  strains per tonsil increased from 1.1 in period 1 to 2.9 and 3.3 in periods 2 and 3, respectively.

AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (cmx), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cmx and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from october of 1993 to march of 1994. the results are summarized as follows; 1.  cmx showed strong antimicrobial activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. antimicrobial activities of cmx against benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) and pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc), and these strong activities suggested that cmx might have strong antimicrobial activities against  beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis. 2. antimicrobial  activities of cmx against microaerophiles, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius and gemella morbillorum and against peptostreptococcus  spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. the mic90's of cmx against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. these values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% cmx nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. it appears likely  that sufficient concentrations exceeding mics against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using cmx nasal solution.

TI  == intracranial complications of sinusitis in childhood.
AB  == complications of sinusitis in children, such as intracranial abscess formation, are uncommon and are often clinically unremarkable in comparison to similar disease processes in adults. between 1983 and 1991, 443 children were admitted to children's national medical center in washington, dc, for treatment of sinusitis. fourteen of these children presented with intracranial extension of the infection and abscess formation. a retrospective review of these patients revealed that the risk of developing an intracranial abscess secondary to sinusitis was 3%. the management of these patients included surgical drainage of the infected sinuses and intracranial surgical exploration. cranialization and exenteration of the frontal sinus proved to be effective single-stage procedures. while not indicated in all patients, these procedures eliminated the sinus as a source of continued or potential infection and obviated the need for a second obliterative procedure. combined antimicrobial therapy and surgical drainage should be the management protocol.

AB  == aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. a total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes  (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases  and together with anaerobes in 87. the most common aerobic isolates were streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. fusobacterium necrophorum and prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, prevotella intermedia from 32%, peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and actinomyces odontolyticus  from 23%. the rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with s. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with f. necrophorum (p < .01). recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with f. necrophorum than among those infected with s. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; p < .0001) or with s. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; p < .05). beta-lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients  studied harbored one or more such strains.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of du-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  == du-6859, (-)-7-[(7s)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1r,2r)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. the mics for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (mic90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. mic50s of du-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those  of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. du-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml,  respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. although the activity of du-6859 against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the mic50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the mic90 level. du-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. strains of bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to du-6859; mic90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. du-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the action of du-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the mics. du-6859 activity was not affected by different media, ph, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

AB  == we examined the antibacterial activity of mx in comparison with those of other ceps, using aerobic gram-positive cocci, aerobic gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria, 870 strains in total, all isolated from clinical specimens, in 1979 and 1980. against streptococcus, cmx showed superior antibacterial activity than those of cfx, cmz, cxm and ctm. against h. influenzae, cmx also showed superior antibacterial activity than those of cfx, cmx, cxm, ctm and cez.  abpc-and pipc-resistant strains were sensitive to cmx. ctx, cpz and czx also showed antibacterial activities equivalent to that of cmx. against enteric bacteria, e. coli, klebsiella, e. cloacae, serratia, c. freundii and proteus, cmx showed superior antibacterial activity than those of cfx, cmz, cxm, ctm and cez.  especially, against e. coli, klebsiella, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri and p. inconstans, cmx showed strong antibacterial activity. as to non-fermentation bacteria, cmx's antibacterial activity was relatively weak except p. putrefaciens, alcaligenes and comamonas. however, it was superior than that of cez. in comparison with other ceps, the strength of cmx varied according to the kinds of bacteria. as to anaerobic bacteria, cmx showed strong antibacterial activity against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, c. perfringens, veillonella and fusobacterium. however, its antibacterial activity against bacteroides was similar to those of other ceps.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. the tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of  7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. there were 207 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates were 101 bacteroides sp (including 10 b fragilis group, and 47 b melaninogenicus group), 29 fusobacterium sp, 34 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 peptococcus sp and 9 peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 veillonella sp. there were 185 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group a, 4 group b, and 2 each group c and f), 14 haemophilus sp (including 12 h influenzae type b) and 5 h parainfluenzae. beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. these were all isolates of s aureus (24) and b fragilis (10), 15 of 47 b melaninogenicus (32%),  5 of the 12 b oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 h influenzae type b (17%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.

TI  == anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of decubitus ulcers in children.
AB  == forty-two children with decubitus ulcers were studied using aerobic and anaerobic techniques. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 21 (50%) of the patients, five times as the only isolates and 16 times mixed with aerobes. aerobes only were present in 20 (48%) of the patients. there were a total of 83 isolates, 46 aerobes and 37 anaerobes, with an average of two species per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.9 anaerobes). the predominant anaerobic isolates were gram-positive cocci (17), bacteroides fragilis (6), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4). the most common aerobic isolates were staphylococcus aureus (23), group a beta hemolytic streptococci (6), hemophilus influenzae (5), and enterobacter agglomerans (5). the polymicrobial etiology of decubitus ulcers in hospitalized children is demonstrated.

TI  == anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of acute conjunctivitis.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic cultures and clinical data were obtained from 131 patients  presenting with acute conjunctivitis. similar cultures were obtained from 60 noninflamed individuals. anaerobes were isolated from 66 patients, 51 times in mixed culture with aerobes and 15 times (11.5%) as the only isolates. aerobes only were recovered in 54 patients. the organisms found to be statistically significantly more commonly recovered from eyes with conjunctivitis were staphylococcus aureus, hemophilus influenzae, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes. no statistical difference was present between the bacterial flora of the eyes with unilateral conjunctivitis when compared to their uninvolved mates in 20 cases in which only one eye was involved.

TI  == bacteriological findings in sinusitis (1963-1975).
AB  == two different studies were performed in order to determine the role of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in sinusitis. aerobes: a retrospective study of 331 cases  of all types of sinusitis (from 1963 till 1975) showed an increasing occurrence of haemophilus influenzae during the last three years. only in the acute sinusitis is streptococcus pneumoniae more frequently found than haemophilus influenzae, which exhibits the highest occurrence in chronic and undeterminable cases. we found cultures with pathogenic aerobes in 64% of the acute and 56% of the chronic cases of sinusitis. anaerobes: a prospective study of 100 sinus secretions from 66 patients with paranasal sinusitis showed the great importance  of anaerobes; they were present in 33% of samples, pure anaerobic cultures in 12% and mixed aerobic-anaerobic in 21%. peptostreptococcus sp. showed the highest occurrence (15%). anaerobic sinusitis is more frequent in unilateral cases. the presence of anaerobes is not dependent on the patient's age or the duration of the sinusitis. in 76% the anaerobes disappeared after the initial antral irrigation.

TI  == evaluation of bacteriological transport systems.
AB  == seven commercially manufactured bacteriological transport systems, including culturette, trans-cul (with stuart and amies), handiswab, securline (with amies and amies without charcoal) and culture caddy, were evaluated to determine whether these systems were capable of maintaining the viability and constant numbers of mixtures of hardy, fastidious and anaerobic organisms over 72 hours at 25c and 4c. the results of the study indicated that if specimens are maintained in transport systems at 25c they should be cultured at four hours to minimize loss of viability and to assure accurate quantitation. no one transport system excelled over the other for maintenance of cultures at room temperature. most organisms survived well in all of the transport systems for 72 hours when refrigerated.

TI  == efficiency of a transport medium for the recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from applicator swabs.
AB  == the survival of four aerobic and four anaerobic pathogens was evaluated quantitatively on cotton swabs and calcium alginate swabs stored in dry tubes as  compared with swabs stored in amies transport medium without charcoal. survival of the pathogens was markedly improved when stored in amies transport medium, although there was considerable loss of viability after a few hours of storage.
