TI  == biological and genetic classification of canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == to investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive lab and bifidobacteria (bf) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, and streptococcus. the lab and bf isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on sds-page protein profile analysis of whole cells. furthermore, partial 16s rdna sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. the identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus lactobacillus  (78.8%), seven species to the genus bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus enterococcus (11.6%), one species of streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). in particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were l. reuteri, l. animalis, and l. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. besides these, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, and streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. the sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the ddbj and the similarity was above 97.2%. their partial 16s rrna genes were registered in the ddbj.

TI  == molecular profiling of lactobacillus, streptococcus, and bifidobacterium species  in feces of active racehorses.
AB  == diversity and compositions of the lactobacillus, streptococcus, and bifidobacterium group in the feces of six healthy, actively racing horses (thoroughbreds) were analyzed by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and real-time pcr with primer sets specific for each group. pcr-dgge analysis of the feces showed that lactobacillus equi, lactobacillus johnsonii, a phylogenetic relative of lactobacillus salivarius, a phylogenetic relative of lactobacillus gastricus, and weissella confusa were predominant in almost all of the feces tested, and streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus was predominant in the streptococcus group. the bifidobacterium group was not detected by single-pcr but atypical species of the  group were found in three of the six thoroughbreds tested by nested-pcr. calculation and estimation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria revealed that lactic acid bacteria were predominant in the feces and bifidobacteria were minor. these results indicate that the community of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in horse feces are unique because of the presence of specific species for horse feces and a minority of the bifidobacterium group. repeated tests of the feces from the same horse over 3 months showed that the diversity and composition of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the feces was basically stable throughout the test period.
