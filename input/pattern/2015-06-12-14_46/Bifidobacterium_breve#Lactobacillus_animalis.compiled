TI  - Evaluation of culture media for selective enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the suitability of Transgalactosylated oligosaccharides-mupirocin lithium salt (TOS-MUP) and MRS-clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (MRS-CC) agars, along with several other culture media, for selectively enumerating bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species commonly used to make fermented milks. Pure culture suspensions of a total of 13 dairy bacteria strains, belonging to eight species and five genera, were tested for growth capability under various incubation conditions. TOS-MUP agar was successfully used for the selective enumeration of both Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and B. breve M-16 V. MRS-CC agar showed relatively good selectivity for Lactobacillus acidophilus, however, it also promoted the growth of Lb. casei strains. For this reason, MRS-CC agar can only be used as a selective medium for the enumeration of Lb. acidophilus if Lb. casei is not present in a product at levels similar to or exceeding those of Lb. acidophilus. Unlike bifidobacteria and coccus-shaped LAB, all the lactobacilli strains involved in this work were found to grow well in MRS pH 5.4 agar incubated under anaerobiosis at 37 degrees C for 72 h. Therefore, this method proved to be particularly suitable for the selective enumeration of Lactobacillus spp.
TI  - Use of tuf gene-based primers for the PCR detection of probiotic Bifidobacterium  species and enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented milk by cultural and quantitative real-time PCR methods.
AB  - Due to the increasing use of bifidobacteria in probiotic products, it is essential to establish a rapid method for the qualitative and quantitative assay of the bifidobacteria in commercial products. In this study, partial sequences of the tuf gene for 18 Bifidobacterium strains belonging to 14 species were determined. Alignment of these sequences showed that the similarities among these Bifidobacterium species were 82.24% to 99.72%. Based on these tuf gene sequences, 6 primer sets were designed for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of B. animalis subsp. animalis, B. animalis subsp. lactis, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. longum subsp. infantis, B. longum subsp. longum, and the genus of Bifidobacterium, respectively. These Bifidobacterium species are common probiotic species present in dairy and probiotic products. When each target Bifidobacterium spp. was assayed with the designed primers, PCR product with expected size was generated. In addition, for each target species, more than 70 bacterial strains other than the target species, including strains of other Bifidobacterium species, strains of Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., and other bacterial species, all generated negative results. PCR assay with primers specific to B. animalis subsp. lactis and B. longum subsp. longum confirmed the presence of these Bifidobacterium species in commercial yogurt products. In addition, for each product, enumeration of the bifidobacteria cells by culture method with BIM-25 agar and the quantitative real-time PCR showed similar cell counts. Such results indicated that within 15-d storage (4 degrees C) after manufacture, all the bifidobacteria cells originally present in yogurt products were viable and culturable during the storage.
TI  - The use of probiotics in healthy volunteers with evacuation disorders and hard stools: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evacuation disorders and hard stools are common in industrialized countries, affecting on average 12% to 17% of the adult healthy population at any age. Dietary supplementation with probiotic microorganisms may be useful in reducing the disorder. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 different probiotic blends, either mixed Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021) and Bifidobacterium breve BR03 (DSM 16604) or Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis BS01 (LMG P-21384), in the management of evacuation disorders and intestinal discomfort. In a period of 5 years (2003 to 2008), the study involved 300 healthy volunteers (151 males and 149 females; age 24 to 71 y) with evacuation disorders and hard stools. In particular, subjects were divided into 3 groups: 80 subjects in the group A received placebo, 110 subjects in the group B received mixed L. plantarum LP01 and B. breve BR03 (2.5 x 10 colony-forming units/d of each strain), and 110 subjects in the group C received B. animalis subsp. lactis BS01 (5 x 10 colony-forming units/d) for 30 days. At the beginning of the observational study, the healthy status of volunteers was evaluated by a complete, laboratory and ultrasound study of the abdomen. The physical examination was repeated after 15 and 30 days. In particular, the main troubles typically associated with evacuation disorders and hard stools as well as abdominal bloating were considered as parameters of interest. Exclusion criteria were items of gastrointestinal diseases and antibiotics intake. RESULTS: Subjects treated with the mixed probiotic strains L. plantarum LP01 and B. breve BR03 or B. animalis subsp. lactis BS01 reported a significant improvement in the number of weekly bowel movements and in the main troubles associated with evacuations, particularly consistency of feces and ease of expulsion. Discomfort items such as abdominal bloating and anal itching, burning, or pain also registered a relevant improvement in the active groups receiving probiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The intake of an effective amount of mixed L. plantarum LP01 and B. breve BR03 or B. animalis subsp. lactis BS01 for 30 days is able to significantly relieve the evacuation disorders and hard stools, thus providing a useful tool for the management of such condition, which is particularly widespread in industrialized countries at any age.
TI  - Oral treatment with probiotics reduces allergic symptoms in ovalbumin-sensitized  mice: a bacterial strain comparative study.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Evidence demonstrating an important role of the intestinal microbiota in the incidence of allergic disorders has led to the concept of using probiotics as possible antiallergic therapy. This study aimed to select a bacterial strain with the best antiallergic treatment effects from a panel of 6 bacterial strains in a mouse model of ovalbumin(OVA)-allergic asthma. METHODS: OVA-sensitized BALB/c mice were orally administered the bacterial strains Bifidobacterium breve M-16V, B. infantis NumRes251, B. animalis NumRes252 and NumRes253, Lactobacillus plantarum NumRes8 and L. rhamnosus NumRes6. After challenge by OVA inhalation in the lungs, the response to methacholine was measured. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed by analyzing bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for the presence of eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes and for interleukin 4, interleukin 5, interleukin 10 and interferon-gamma. OVA-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a were measured in serum. Next, the effect on acute allergic skin reaction was measured after treatment with B. breve M-16V and L. plantarum NumRes8. RESULTS: Of the panel of 6 strains, B. breve M-16V and L. plantarum NumRes8 inhibited (1) the response to methacholine, (2) reduced the number of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, (3) reduced both OVA-specific IgE and (4) OVA-specific IgG1, whereas the other strains did not affect all these parameters simultaneously. B. breve M-16V but not L. plantarum NumRes8 reduced interleukin 4, interleukin 5 and interleukin 10. Furthermore, B. breve M-16V but not L. plantarum NumRes8 reduced acute allergic skin reactions to OVA. CONCLUSION: B. breve M-16V was identified as the most potent antiallergic strain.
TI  - The effect of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) byproducts and ellagitannins on the growth of human gut bacteria.
AB  - The consumption of pomegranate products leads to a significant accumulation of ellagitannins in the large intestines, where they interact with complex gut microflora. This study investigated the effect of pomegranate tannin constituents on the growth of various species of human gut bacteria. Our results showed that pomegranate byproducts and punicalagins inhibited the growth of pathogenic clostridia and Staphyloccocus aureus. Probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were generally not affected by ellagitannins, while relatively small growth inhibition by ellagic acid likely resulted from decreasing media quality due to the formation of tannin-protein complexes. The effect of pomegranate ellagitannins on bifidobacteria was species- and tannin-dependent. The growth of Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis was slightly inhibited by punicalagins, punicalins, and ellagic acid. POMx supplementation significantly enhanced the growth of Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium infantis.
TI  - Detection of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (Bb12) in the intestine after feeding of sows and their piglets.
AB  - A real-time PCR method has been developed to distinguish Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies in the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs. Identification of a highly conserved single-copy tuf gene encoding the elongation factor Tu involved in bacterial protein biosynthesis was used as a marker to differentiate homologous Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (strain Bb12) from Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis, as well as Bifidobacterium suis, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, several species of Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus faecium. Real-time PCR detection of serially diluted DNA extracted from a pure culture of Bb12 was linear for bacterial numbers ranging from 10 to 10,000 tuf gene copies per PCR (r(2) = 0.99). Relative differences in Bb12 bacterial numbers in pigs fed daily with Bb12 were determined after detection of Bb12 tuf gene copies in DNA extracted from the intestinal contents. Piglets treated with Bb12 immediately after birth maintained a high level of Bb12 in their large intestines with continuous daily administration of Bb12. Piglets born to Bb12-treated sows during the last third of their gestation and also treated with Bb12 at birth (T/T group) had a higher number of Bb12 organisms per gram of intestinal contents compared to placebo-treated piglets born to placebo-treated sows (C/C group), Bb12-treated sows (T/C group), or piglets born to placebo sows but treated with Bb12 immediately after birth (C/T group). In addition, there was a significant increase in gene expression for Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in piglets from the T/T group, with no change in TLR2 and TLR4. These findings suggest that the tuf gene represents a specific and functional marker for detecting Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strain Bb12 within the microbiota of the intestine.
TI  - The effect of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. administration on the morphology of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas in piglets.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of administration of probiotic bacteria on morphology of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas. The experiment was performed on 15 piglets at the age from 3 to 35 days, intragastrically administered with Bifidobacterium breve, B. animalis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria. In all piglets examined, the development of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas was observed to progress normally. After microflora administration to the piglets, an increase in the number of fibrocytes and fibroblasts was observed in the mucosa lamina propria of stomach and intestines. An increase was also reported in the number and activation of endocrine cells in the stomach and small intestines. The activity of alkaline and acid phosphatases, as well as succinic (SDH) and lactic (LDH) dehydrogenases, was found to be higher after the administration of probiotics. The administration of bacteria, especially of Lactobacillus acidophilus, caused an increase in the number of lymphocytes and lymphoid cells in lamina propria and intraepithelial lymphocytes in the small intestine. Enhanced proliferation of crypt cells was observed in the crypts of intestinal glands; however, there were no statistically significant differences in the PCNA index between the control and probiotic-administered groups. The performed study showed that the administration of probiotic bacteria has no negative impact on the morphology of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreas and is found beneficial to its functioning and immune processes.
TI  - Production of oligosaccharides in yogurt containing bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures.
AB  - Yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, and Bifidobacterium longum) and by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees C) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. The survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing B. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. In fact, the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing B. infantis. However, yogurts containing B. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. The use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (B. animalis, B. infantis, or B. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effects of Galla Rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of Galla Rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.
TI  - Development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - An in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. The transit tolerance of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37 degrees C to a simulated gastric juice (pH 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (pH 8.0), containing pancreatin USP (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. The methodology was also employed to determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [SBTCI] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. The majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. Only one isolate, Lactobacillus fermentum KLD, was considered intrinsically resistant. The addition of milk proteins, singly and in combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. In this regard, two isolates, Lact. casei 212.3 and Bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. In general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. However, it increased that of Lact. casei 242 and Lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of B. bifidum 2715 and B. animalis Bo. Selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. Only Lact. casei F19 and B. adolescentis 15703T showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. In general, the addition of milk proteins and SBTCI did not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. However, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of Lact. casei F19 but diminished that of B. breve 15700T. It is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. In addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.
TI  - Digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - The numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal DNA of Bifidobacterium longum 6001 and Bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. These DNA probes strongly hybridized with DNA of B. longum, B. adolescentis, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium suis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium angulatum, and Bifidobacterium animalis. Detectable positive signals with DNA of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, and Bifidobacterium thermophilum were also found after hybridization. When dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these DNA probes; Lactobacillus fermentum JCM 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. The counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using BL agar medium. Furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.
