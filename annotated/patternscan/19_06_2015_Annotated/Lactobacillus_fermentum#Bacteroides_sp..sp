TI  == polysaccharide from seeds of plantago asiatica l. affects lipid metabolism and colon microbiota of mouse.
AB  == polysaccharide from the seeds of plantago asiatica l. was given via oral administration to mice (0.4 g/kg body weight, 30 days) to observe its effects on  mouse nutrient metabolism and colon microbiota. it was found the polysaccharide intake could lower the apparent absorption of lipid. total triglyceride, cholesterol, and atherogenic index in blood serum with total lipid and cholesterol levels in liver of polysaccharide group mice were all significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). furthermore, the effect of the  polysaccharide intake on mouse colon bacterial communities was investigated. mice from the polysaccharide group showed a higher colon bacterial diversity than the  control group. bacteroides sp., eubacterium sp., butyrate-producing bacteria butyrivibrio sp., and probiotics bifidobacterium bifidum , lactobacillus fermentum , and lactobacillus reuteri in mouse colon were all increased after polysaccharide intake. these indicated that the intake of polysaccharide from p.  asiatica l. could be beneficial for lipid metabolism and colon microbiota.
