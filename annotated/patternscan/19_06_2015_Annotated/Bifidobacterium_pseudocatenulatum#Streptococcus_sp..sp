TI  == viability and activity of bifidobacteria during refrigerated storage of yoghurt containing mangifera pajang fibrous polysaccharides.
AB  == the viability and activity of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum g4, b. longum bb  536 and yoghurt cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) were studied in yoghurt containing 0.75% mangefira pajang fibrous polysaccharides (mpfp) and inulin. growth of probiotic organisms,  their proteolytic activities, the production of short chain fatty acids (lactic,  acetic and propionic) and the ph of the yoghurt samples were determined during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees c for 28 d. b. pseudocatenulatum g4 and b. longum bb 536 showed better growth and activity in the presence of mpfp and inulin, which significantly increased the production of short chain fatty acids as well as the proteolytic activity of these organisms. practical application: this is the first study reported on produce synbiotic yoghurt as a functional food for specified health uses contains bifidobacteria and m. pajang fibrous polysaccharides. m. pajang fibrous polysaccharides can be used as a prebiotic particularly in dairy products to increase the viability and activity of bifidobacteria which can be used as probiotic to exert health benefit to the human by yoghurt that is considered common use in society; thus, the benefits of  synbiotic yoghurt are readily accessible to the member of society.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.
