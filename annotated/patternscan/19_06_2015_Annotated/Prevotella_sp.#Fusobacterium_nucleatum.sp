TI  == the influence of biofilm formation by gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes on bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the worldwide leading vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age. bv is characterized by the replacement of beneficial lactobacilli and the augmentation of anaerobic bacteria. gardnerella vaginalis is a predominant bacterial species, however, bv is also associated with other numerous anaerobes, such as atopobium vaginae, mobiluncus mulieris, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptoniphilus sp.. currently, the role of g. vaginalis in the etiology of bv remains a matter of controversy. it is however known that, in bv patients, a biofilm is usually formed on the vaginal epithelium and g. vaginalis is typically the predominant species. so, the current paradigm is that the establishment of a biofilm plays a key role in the pathogenesis of bv. this review provides background on the influence of biofilm formation by g. vaginalis and other anaerobes in the polymicrobial etiology of bv, through its initial adhesion until biofilm formation and discusses the commensal and synergic interactions established between them to understand the phenotypic shift of g. vaginalis' biofilms into bv establishment.

TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == association between periodontal condition and subgingival microbiota in women during pregnancy: a longitudinal study.
AB  == objective: in this study, the gingival conditions and the quantitative detection  for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in pregnant women were determined. material  and methods: quantitative determinations of periodontal bacteria by using a sybr  green system in women during pregnancy were performed. women at the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and non-pregnant women were included in this study. a. actinomycetemcomitans was observed in high numbers in women at the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy with a significant difference (p<0.05). f. nucleatum and  p. intermedia were also observed in high levels. results and conclusion: our results show that pregnant women are more susceptible to gingivitis, and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival biofilm might be taken into account for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  == nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. all the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (control). all the interventions had a duration of 30 days. the dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. the supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). the total genome counts  from the control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). after 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis. other major periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels.  the toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts  in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16s rrna gene clone library analysis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. methodology: apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the  kyushu university hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. dna was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16s rrna gene. enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and specific fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis with specific primers. results: bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were p. gingivalis (19.9%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and propionibacterium acnes (9%). bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. in addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: prevotella spp., treponema spp., peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113, olsenella uli, slackia exigua, selemonas infelix, p. gingivalis with type iv fima, and a combination of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113 and predominance of streptococcus spp. on the other hand, neither enterococcus faecalis nor c. albicans were detected in any of the samples. conclusion: whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the  persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. the diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.

TI  == effects of stress hormones on the production of volatile sulfur compounds by periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == little is known about the effects of stress hormones on the etiologic agents of halitosis. thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the effects of adrenaline (adr), noradrenaline (na) and cortisol (cort) on bacteria that produce volatile sulfur compounds (vsc), the major gases responsible for bad breath. cultures of fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas endodontalis (pe), prevotella intermedia (pi) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were exposed to 50 microm adr, na and cort or equivalent volumes of sterile water as controls for 12 and 24 h. growth was evaluated based on absorbance at 660 nm. portable gas chromatography was used to measure vsc concentrations. kruskal-wallis and the dunn post-hoc test were used to compare the groups. for fn, adr, na and cort significantly reduced bacterial growth after 12 h and 24 h (p<0.05). all the substances tested increased hydrogen sulfide (h2s) production (p<0.05). for pe, all the substances tested reduced bacterial development after 24 h (p<0.05), and  na significantly increased the h2s concentration after 12 h (p<0.05). in the pg and pi cultures, no effects on bacterial growth were observed (p>0.05). in the pi cultures, adr, na and cort increased h2s (p<0.05). catecholamines and cortisol can interfere with growth and h2s production of sub-gingival species in vitro. this process appears to be complex and supports the association between stress and the production of vsc.

TI  == bacteriological analysis of necrotic pulp and fistulae in primary teeth.
AB  == objectives: primary teeth work as guides for the eruption of permanent dentition, contribute for the development of the jaws, chewing process, preparing food for digestion, and nutrient assimilation. treatment of pulp necrosis in primary teeth is complex due to anatomical and physiological characteristics and high number of bacterial species present in endodontic infections. the bacterial presence alone  or in association in necrotic pulp and fistula samples from primary teeth of boys and girls was evaluated. material and methods: necrotic pulp (103) and fistula (7) samples from deciduous teeth with deep caries of 110 children were evaluated. bacterial morphotypes and species from all clinical samples were determined. results: a predominance of gram-positive cocci (81.8%) and gram-negative coccobacilli (49.1%) was observed. in 88 out of 103 pulp samples, a high prevalence of enterococcus spp. (50%), porphyromonas gingivalis (49%), fusobacterium nucleatum (25%) and prevotella nigrescens (11.4%) was observed. porphyromonas gingivalis was detected in three out of seven fistula samples, enterococcus spp. in two out of seven samples, and f. nucleatum, p. nigrescens and d. pneumosintes in one out of seven samples. conclusions: our results show that enterococcus spp. and p. gingivalis were prevalent in necrotic pulp from deciduous teeth in boys from 2 to 5 years old, and that care of the oral cavity of children up to five years of age is important.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == bacterial community development in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == current knowledge of the microbial composition of dental plaque in early gingivitis is based largely on microscopy and cultural methods, which do not provide a comprehensive description of oral microbial communities. this study used 454-pyrosequencing of the v1-v3 region of 16s rrna genes (approximately 500  bp), and bacterial culture, to characterize the composition of plaque during the  transition from periodontal health to gingivitis. a total of 20 healthy volunteers abstained from oral hygiene for two weeks, allowing plaque to accumulate and gingivitis to develop. plaque samples were analyzed at baseline, and after one and two weeks. in addition, plaque samples from 20 chronic periodontitis patients were analyzed for cross-sectional comparison to the experimental gingivitis cohort. all of the healthy volunteers developed gingivitis after two weeks. pyrosequencing yielded a final total of 344,267 sequences after filtering, with a mean length of 354 bases, that were clustered into an average of 299 species-level operational taxonomic units (otus) per sample. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots revealed significant shifts in the bacterial community structure of plaque as gingivitis was induced, and community diversity increased significantly after two weeks. changes in the relative abundance of otus during the transition from health to gingivitis were correlated to bleeding on probing (bop) scores and resulted in the identification of new health- and gingivitis-associated taxa. comparison of the healthy volunteers to the periodontitis patients also confirmed the association of a number of putative periodontal pathogens with chronic periodontitis. taxa associated with gingivitis included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, lachnospiraceae [g-2] sp. hot100, lautropia sp. hota94, and prevotella oulorum, whilst rothia dentocariosa was associated with periodontal health. further study  of these taxa is warranted and may lead to new therapeutic approaches to prevent  periodontal disease.

TI  == comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: this clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [lpss]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating lps contents with clinical/radiographic findings. in addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. methods: samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. the limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16s rdna) was used for bacterial investigation. results: endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 eu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively (p < .05). the median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly  higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (p < .05). prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). conclusions: teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique (roqt) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB  == approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. the aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. oligonucleotides targeting the 16s ribosomal dna gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. these probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as tm7 sp. ot 346, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041. sensitivity and  specificity of the probes were determined. a universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a ccd camera. in a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and actinomyces gerencseriae were  the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. among uncultivated/unrecognized species, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and prevotella sp. ot 306 were the most numerous. porphyromonas gingivalis and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. direct hybridization of total  nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  == background: direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and dna-dna hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (orn). the purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible  after radiation therapy. design: bacterial dna was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, transformed into escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. results: from the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were  detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. the predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone fg014, uncultured bacterium clone  rl178, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella spp. the study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in orn. in contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. conclusions: diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of orn in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. to better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with orn is necessary.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  == oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. in this study, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time pcr. forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and dna was obtained. quantitative  detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific taqman probe/primer sets. total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial dna were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. all periodontal bacteria except for the f. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their dna represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial dna obtained from periodontitis patients. porphyromonas gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected most often. the presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. in addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial dna could be observed. the significant number of periodontopathic bacterial dna species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.

AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == bacterial species in subgingival plaque and oral bone loss in postmenopausal women.
AB  == background: oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. we investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. methods: a cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the buffalo, new york women's health initiative observational study was conducted. standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ach). subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. results: the most prevalent infection was streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by prevotella intermedia (43.4%), tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), campylobacter rectus (17.4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). infections with p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, and c. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ach, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. the body mass index (bmi) was a modifier of this association. overweight women with t. forsythensis infection were more likely to  have oral bone loss (or = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.08 to 5.46) than  normal weight (or = 1.27; 95% ci: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (or = 1.26, 95% ci: 0.72 to 2.20) women with t. forsythensis infection. conclusions: the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal  women. those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of bmi and/or inflammatory factors.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == molecular analysis of microbial diversity in advanced caries.
AB  == real-time pcr analysis of the total bacterial load in advanced carious lesions has shown that the total load exceeds the number of cultivable bacteria. this suggests that an unresolved complexity exists in bacteria associated with advanced caries. in this report, the profile of the microflora of carious dentine was explored by using dna extracted from 10 lesions selected on the basis of comparable total microbial load and on the relative abundance of prevotella spp.  using universal primers for the 16s rrna gene, pcr amplicons were cloned, and approximately 100 transformants were processed for each lesion. phylogenetic analysis of 942 edited sequences demonstrated the presence of 75 species or phylotypes in the 10 carious lesions. up to 31 taxa were represented in each sample. a diverse array of lactobacilli were found to comprise 50% of the species, with prevotellae also abundant, comprising 15% of the species. other taxa present in a number of lesions or occurring with high abundance included selenomonas spp., dialister spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium spp., members of the lachnospiraceae family, olsenella spp., bifidobacterium spp., propionibacterium sp., and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. the mechanisms by which such diverse patterns of bacteria extend carious lesions, including the aspect of infection of the vital dental pulp, remain unclear.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and antimicrobial susceptibility of subgingival bacteria from refractory periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the extent of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in subgingival plaque samples obtained from 25 patients with refractory marginal periodontitis in the usa. beta-lactamase-positive isolates were characterized using commercial diagnostic kits and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the susceptibilities to different antimicrobial agents were tested and, in addition,  the isolates were screened for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases  (esbls). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 18 (72%) patients. the most prominent beta-lactamase-producing organisms belonged to the anaerobic genus prevotella. other enzyme-producing anaerobic strains were fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp. facultative bacteria, such as burkholderia spp., ralstonia pickettii, capnocytophaga spp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and neisseria sp., were also detected among the enzyme-producers. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin and  amoxicillin were in the range 1.5-256 micrograms/ml and 4-256 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the isolates of the prevotella species. all prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole, but they showed variable resistance to tetracyclines. two of the prevotella isolates had high mics of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. esbl activity was not detected in any of the  beta-lactamase-producing isolates by the etest method. thus, our study demonstrated a wide variety of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that may play a  role in refractory periodontal disease.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  == oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate-containing mouthwash (chxm) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. the microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). chxm caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe  and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (p < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. the degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. dgge showed that chxm exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in prevotella sp. and selenomonas infelix. pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to chx, while lactobacillus rhamnosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. determination of the mics of triclosan, chx, erythromycin, penicillin v, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of chxm exposure, showed that chxm exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to chx (p < 0.05). changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. in conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to chxm represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

TI  == characteristics of brain abscess with isolation of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == in view of its localization, brain abscess (ba) usually requires medical and surgical care. a broad spectrum of bacteria is involved. recent reports stress the increasing frequency of anaerobes, but their impact has not been well evaluated. a retrospective review was conducted of all episodes of documented ba  admitted in a tertiary-care hospital over a 10 y period. ba due to anaerobic bacteria (group a) were compared with other cases (group b) to determine the frequency and eventual characteristics of ba with isolated anaerobic bacteria. between 1991 and 2000, ba were diagnosed in 42 patients (28m, 14f, mean age 54.6  y). no differences in clinical features and laboratory findings were found between patients with ba caused by anaerobic (n = 22) and only aerobic (n = 20) bacteria. using appropriate microbiological techniques, 41 anaerobic bacteria strains were isolated in 22 of 42 patients (52.4%) with ba. anaerobic bacteria were associated with aerobic strains in 5 patients (12%), whereas in 17 patients  (40.5%) only anaerobic strains were isolated in cerebral puncture cultures. the most frequently isolated species were fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 14), prevotella sp. (n = 8), actinomyces sp. (n = 6) and bacteroides sp. (n = 4). compared with group b, group a had more cases of a single abscess (p = 0.03) and  ear, nose and throat (ent) as a source of infection (p = 0.04), and seemed to have a better outcome (p = 0.07). these results emphasize the important role that anaerobic bacteria play in ba. the presence of such pathogens must be evoked when faced with a single abscess, an ent infection, or both. therapy should take into  account this high frequency.

AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a microbiological evaluation of sites with and without clinical evidence of moderate and severe periodontitis and their correlation with clinical parameters. a total of 52 disease sites and 10 healthy  sites were selected according to clinical criteria. the following clinical indexes were measured for all the sites: plaque index, gingival index, blood on probing, depth on probing and insertion level. samples of subgingival plaque were collected for culture and for differential counts of microbial morphotypes. in disease sites the most frequently isolated were: prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (65%), porphyromonas gingivalis (23%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10%) and peptostreptococcus sp. (31%). the aerobic gram-positive microflora was predominant in healthy sites. significant differences were observed in microbial morphotypes between healthy and disease sites: cocci 18.71% and 78.90%, motile rods 46.12% and 16.70%, total spirochetes  26.48% and 2.80%, respectively. the presence of motile rods, spirochetes and p. intermedia/nigrescens were the parameters with most sensitivity to suspect periodontal disease. there were significant differences in the subgingival microflora between healthy and disease sites in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis.

TI  == detection of major putative periodontopathogens in korean advanced adult periodontitis patients using a nucleic acid-based approach.
AB  == background: although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a korean population so far. the purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in korean patients by culture-independent methods. methods: a total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken  from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. ap samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [pd]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm pd) in each patient. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. aliquots of pcr products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. results: all diseased sites harbored fusobacterium sp., while porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema sp., and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. peptostreptococcus micros, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. in  sites of periodontally healthy subjects, fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). treponema sp., p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. p. micros, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy  sites, respectively. the prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (p <0.05). conclusions: using highly sensitive methods relying on 16s ribosomal rna-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with ap patients in a korean population. with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.

TI  == the microbial spectrum of brain abscess with special reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the bacteriological and clinical findings of 18 cases of brain abscess are presented. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic strains was performed both by conventional methods and the newer rapid ana ii panel and e-test methods, respectively. characterization of the anaerobic isolates was done by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp). anaerobic or aerobic organisms alone were recovered in three (16.6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic  in another three (16.6%) patients. there were nine anaerobic isolates. the predominant anaerobes were prevotella melaninogenicus (four isolates), bacteroides preacutus (three isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus sp. (one isolate each). a total of six aerobic isolates, all of which were gram-positive cocci were recovered. all the anaerobic isolates were susceptible to metronidazole, but two isolates of p. melaninogenicus were resistant to penicillin. there was complete agreement between the identification  based on biochemical profiles and rflp patterns. these findings indicate the microbial complexity of brain abscess and the need to target antimicrobial therapy against both the aerobic and anaerobic components of infection.

TI  == features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with chediak-higashi syndrome.
AB  == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (c-hs) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. the complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. methods: a 14-year-old male c-hs patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of c-hs. results: laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. these granules and inclusions were characteristic of chediak-higashi syndrome. oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque  samples, including fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sp. biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear  leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. viable dividing bacteria were  found in the cytoplasm. conclusions: in this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of c-hs granulocyte deficiency. periodontal treatment  of these patients is often unsuccessful. this case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.

(n = 20, 60 %) and fusobacterium  nucleatum (n = 5, 15 %). the production of beta -lactamase was demonstrated in 13/27 gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. all patients in whom anaerobic bacteria were isolated from transnasal punctures had had a nasogastric tube. patients in whom anaerobic bacteria were isolated more frequently had neurological disorders  upon admission (p < 0.02). ten patients (30 %) had nosocomial pneumonia, 8 of whom had at least one identical strain in both lung and sinus cultures, including 2 patients with anaerobic bacteria isolation. conclusions: using appropriate microbiological techniques, anaerobic bacteria were frequently isolated in nosocomial sinusitis. if necessary, the empirical choice of antimicrobial therapy in patients with nosocomial sinusitis should take into account these results.

AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == activities of hmr 3004 (ru 64004) and hmr 3647 (ru 66647) compared to those of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and eight other antimicrobial agents against unusual aerobic and anaerobic human and animal bite  pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue infections in humans.
AB  == the activities of hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 and comparator agents, especially macrolides, were determined by the agar dilution method against 262 aerobic and 120 anaerobic strains isolated from skin and soft tissue infections associated with human and animal bite wounds. hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were active against almost all aerobic and fastidious facultative isolates (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively) and against all anaerobes [bacteroides tectum, porphyromonas macacae (salivosa), prevotella heparinolytica, porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., and peptostreptococci] at < or = 0.25 and < or = 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, except  fusobacterium nucleatum (hmr 3004, mic90 = 16 microg/ml; hmr 3647, mic90 = 8 microg/ml) and other fusobacterium species (mic90, 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively). in general, hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were more active than any of the macrolides tested. azithromycin was more active than clarithromycin against all pasteurella species, including pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida, eikenella  corrodens, and fusobacterium species, while clarithromycin was more active than azithromycin against corynebacterium species, weeksella zoohelcum, b. tectum, and p. heparinolytica.

TI  == microbiology of periapical abscesses and associated maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == aspirate of pus from 5 periapical abscesses of the upper jaw and their corresponding maxillary sinusitis were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. polymicrobial flora were found in all instances, where the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5. anaerobes were recovered from all specimens. the predominant isolates were prevotella sp., porphyromonas sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus sp. concordance in the microbiological findings between periapical abscess and the maxillary sinus flora was found in all instances. however, certain organisms were only present at one site and not the other. five beta-lactamase-producing organisms were present in the five specimens. these data confirm the importance of anaerobic bacteria in periapical  abscesses and demonstrate their predominance in maxillary sinusitis that is associated with them.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  == objective: to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. design: retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. setting: navy hospital in bethesda, md. results: sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). the predominant aerobic bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), escherichia coli (n = 7), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and klebsiella sp (n =  3). the most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; b fragilis and enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and s aureus and p aeruginosa and citrobacter sp, with burns. conclusion: these data illustrate the  importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.

TI  == occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in chile.
AB  == the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp) patients. the subgingival proportion of  the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. the results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%)  there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, c. rectus, and f. nucleatum in ljp, and for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum in gjp. the mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (p < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. capnocytophaga sp, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and e. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in ljp. when taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with ljp and gjp in chile are p. gingivalis (66% of ljp and 80% of gjp affected sites), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of ljp and 50% in gjp affected sites). different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease  process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  == a total of 243 strains of fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. the strains included 65 (27%) fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) fusobacterium varium, three (1%) fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) fusobacterium gonidiaformans. most fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. these included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. the organisms most commonly isolated with fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. (95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.
