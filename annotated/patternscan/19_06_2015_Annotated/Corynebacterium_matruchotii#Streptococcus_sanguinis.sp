TI  == calcium and water diffusion in single-species model bacterial plaques.
AB  == the diffusion of tritiated water and 45ca through single-species model plaques was measured in a diaphragm cell. using plaques of streptococcus downei, the apparent diffusion coefficient for tritiated water showed a small but significant decrease between ph 7.0 and 5.0 with a smaller, non-significant decrease for calcium. these effects are attributed to possible plaque shrinkage at reduced ph, which overcomes effects due to charge-dependent changes in permeability. effective diffusion coefficients for 45ca obtained from lag-time measurements were much reduced at low carrier concentrations, demonstrating a binding which correlated with previous results from equilibrium dialysis. strep. sanguis and corynebacterium matruchotii showed few differences from strep. downei, although the corynebacterium previously demonstrated stronger calcium binding. permeability to water and calcium were slightly affected by ph, while effective diffusion of calcium depended on concentration. this may have important implications for the process of mineral loss in dental caries.

TI  == a quantitative study of calcium binding and aggregation in selected oral bacteria.
AB  == by means of micro-equilibrium dialysis, calcium binding capacities and affinities were measured in three different oral bacteria, and the effects of extracellular  polysaccharide, ph, and aggregation were investigated. binding capacities of 31.0 +/- 2.1 (c. matruchotii), 34.7 +/- 3.7 (s. sanguis), and 41.5 +/- 5.4 (s. downei) mumol calcium/g wet weight of cells were found at ph 7.0, falling to 21.4 +/- 0.8 mumol calcium/g wet wt. cells at ph 5.0 for s. downei. dissociation constants were found to vary between 0.78 +/- 0.24 and 1.77 +/- 0.30 mmol/l (at ph 7.0, depending on species), and between 0.62 +/- 0.04 and 1.77 +/- 0.30 (in the ph range 5.0 to 7.0, for s. downei only). examination suggested that at ph 7.0 calcium-facilitated bacterial association occurs in the streptococci with calcium uptake curves analogous with those of positively cooperative systems. desorption  of calcium from aggregated s. downei suggested that the mechanism of desorption differed from that of uptake. this may be an important factor in plaque formation and in the binding of cells to the surface of formed plaque. plaque calcium forms a reservoir, readily released by a ph drop, which may increase plaque fluid saturation and reduce demineralization.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
