TI  == recombination between streptococcus suis icessu32457 and streptococcus agalactiae icesa2603 yields a hybrid ice transferable to streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == integrative conjugative elements (ices) are mobile genetic elements that reside in the chromosome but retain the ability to undergo excision and to transfer by conjugation. genes involved in drug resistance, virulence, or niche adaptation are often found among backbone genes as cargo dna. we recently characterized in streptococcus suis an ice (icessu32457) carrying resistance genes [tet(o/w/32/o), tet(40), erm(b), apha, and aade] in the 15k unstable genetic element, which is flanked by two approximately 1.3kb direct repeats. remarkably, approximately 1.3-kb sequences are conserved in icesa2603 of streptococcus agalactiae 2603v/r,  which carry heavy metal resistance genes cadc/cada and mer. in matings between s. suis 32457 (donor) and s. agalactiae 2603v/r (recipient), transconjugants were obtained. pcr experiments, pfge, and sequence analysis of transconjugants demonstrated a tandem array between icessu32457 and icesa2603. matings between tandem array-containing s. agalactiae 2603v/r (donor) and streptococcus pyogenes  rf12 (recipient) yielded a single transconjugant containing a hybrid ice, here named icesa2603/icessu32457. the hybrid formed by recombination of the left approximately 1.3-kb sequence of icessu32457 and the approximately 1.3-kb sequence of icesa2603. interestingly, the hybrid ice was transferable between s.  pyogenes strains, thus demonstrating that it behaves as a conventional ice. these findings suggest that both tandem arrays and hybrid ices may contribute to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in streptococci, creating novel mobile elements capable of disseminating new combinations of antibiotic resistance genes.

TI  == transduction of the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(a) and tet(o), to other streptococcus species.
AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == scabies mites alter the skin microbiome and promote growth of opportunistic pathogens in a porcine model.
AB  == background: the resident skin microbiota plays an important role in restricting pathogenic bacteria, thereby protecting the host. scabies mites (sarcoptes scabiei) are thought to promote bacterial infections by breaching the skin barrier and excreting molecules that inhibit host innate immune responses. epidemiological studies in humans confirm increased incidence of impetigo, generally caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, secondary to the epidermal infestation with the parasitic mite. it is therefore possible that mite infestation could alter the healthy skin microbiota making way for the  opportunistic pathogens. a longitudinal study to test this hypothesis in humans is near impossible due to ethical reasons. in a porcine model we generated scabies infestations closely resembling the disease manifestation in humans and investigated the scabies associated changes in the skin microbiota over the course of a mite infestation. methodology/principal findings: in a 21 week trial, skin scrapings were collected from pigs infected with s. scabies var. suis and scabies-free control animals. a total of 96 skin scrapings were collected before, during infection and after acaricide treatment, and analyzed by bacterial 16s rdna tag-encoded flx-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing. we found significant changes in the epidermal microbiota, in particular a dramatic increase in staphylococcus correlating with the onset of mite infestation in animals challenged with scabies mites. this increase persisted beyond treatment from mite infection and healing of skin. furthermore, the staphylococci population shifted  from the commensal s. hominis on the healthy skin prior to scabies mite challenge to s. chromogenes, which is increasingly recognized as being pathogenic, coinciding with scabies infection in pigs. in contrast, all animals in the scabies-free cohort remained relatively free of staphylococcus throughout the trial. conclusions/significance: this is the first experimental in vivo evidence  supporting previous assumptions that establishment of pathogens follow scabies infection. our findings provide an explanation for a biologically important aspect of the disease pathogenesis. the methods developed from this pig trial will serve as a guide to analyze human clinical samples. studies building on this will offer implications for development of novel intervention strategies against  the mites and the secondary infections.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == common regulators of virulence in streptococci.
AB  == streptococcal species are a diverse group of bacteria which can be found in animals and humans. their interactions with host organisms can vary from commensal to pathogenic. many of the pathogenic species are causative agents of severe, invasive infections in their hosts, accounting for a high burden of morbidity and mortality, associated with high economic costs in industry and health care. among them, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus suis are discussed here. an environmentally stimulated and tightly controlled expression of their virulence factors is of utmost importance for their pathogenic potential. thus, the most universal and widespread regulators from the classes of stand-alone transcriptional regulators, two-component signal transduction systems (tcs), eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases, and small noncoding rnas are the topic  of this chapter. the regulatory levels are reviewed with respect to function, activity, and their role in pathogenesis. understanding of and interfering with transcriptional regulation mechanisms and networks is a promising basis for the development of novel anti-infective therapies.

TI  == interspecies mobilization of an ermt-carrying plasmid of streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis by a coresident ice of the icesa2603 family.
AB  == objectives: the recently documented presence of almost identical, small, non-self-transmissible, erm(t)-carrying plasmids in clonally unrelated erythromycin-resistant isolates of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae suggests that these plasmids somehow circulate in the streptococcal population. the objective of this study was to characterize the erm(t)-carrying genetic element in a clinical isolate of streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (sde5580) and to provide a possible explanation for the spread of erm(t)-carrying plasmids in streptococci. methods: the erm(t)-carrying element of sde5580 was investigated by plasmid analysis, pcr experiments and sequencing. transfer and retransfer experiments were performed using s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and streptococcus suis strains as recipients and by selection in the presence of suitable drug concentrations. transconjugants were analysed by smai-macrorestriction analysis. genetic studies also included pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using hindiii endonuclease. results: sde5580 contained two mobile genetic elements: a 4950 bp erm(t)-carrying plasmid  (p5580) almost identical to the non-self-transmissible erm(t)-carrying plasmids of s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae mentioned above, and an ~63 kb cadc/cada-carrying integrative and conjugative element (icesde3396-like) of the icesa2603 family. p5580 was transferable at high frequency to the recipients of all three species through in trans mobilization by the coresident icesde3396-like element. p5580 and icesde3396-like were able to be transferred either separately  or together. conclusions: this is the first evidence of horizontal transfer of an erm(t)-carrying plasmid between streptococci. in trans mobilization by coresident ices may be one mechanism for the spread of erm(t)-carrying plasmids in the streptococcal population.

TI  == characterization of a streptococcus suis tet(o/w/32/o)-carrying element transferable to major streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == mosaic tetracycline resistance determinants are a recently discovered class of hybrids of ribosomal protection tet genes. they may show different patterns of mosaicism, but their final size has remained unaltered. initially thought to be confined to a small group of anaerobic bacteria, mosaic tet genes were then found to be widespread. in the genus streptococcus, a mosaic tet gene [tet(o/w/32/o)] was first discovered in streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant pig and human pathogen. in this study, we report the molecular characterization of a tet(o/w/32/o) gene-carrying mobile element from an s. suis isolate. tet(o/w/32/o) was detected, in tandem with tet(40), in a circular 14,741-bp genetic element (39.1% g+c; 17 open reading frames [orfs] identified). the novel element, which we designated 15k, also carried the macrolide resistance determinant erm(b) and an aminoglycoside resistance four-gene cluster including aade (streptomycin) and  apha (kanamycin). 15k appeared to be an unstable genetic element that, in the absence of recombinases, is capable of undergoing spontaneous excision under standard growth conditions. in the integrated form, 15k was found inside a 54,879-bp integrative and conjugative element (ice) (50.5% g+c; 55 orfs), which we designated icessu32457. an approximately 1.3-kb segment that apparently served as the att site for excision of the unstable 15k element was identified. the novel ice was transferable at high frequency to recipients from pathogenic streptococcus species (s. suis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae), suggesting that the multiresistance 15k element can successfully spread within streptococcal populations.

TI  == the two-component system ihk/irr contributes to the virulence of streptococcus suis serotype 2 strain 05zyh33 through alteration of the bacterial cell metabolism.
AB  == streptococcus suis serotype 2 (s. suis 2) is an important zoonotic pathogen. it causes heavy economic losses in the pig-farming industry and can be associated with severe infections in humans, e.g. streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. understanding its pathogenesis is critical for prevention and control of diseases caused by s. suis 2. in this study, we show that deletion of a two-component system (tcs), 05ssu1660/1661 (orthologues of the ihk/irr tcs of streptococcus pyogenes), in s. suis 2 strain 05zyh33 results in notable attenuation of virulence, as exemplified by reduced adherence to mucosal epithelium cells, increased elimination by macrophages, reduced ability to survive in an acidic or  oxidative-stressed environment, and lowered pathogenicity in mice. further analysis of differential proteomics profiles by two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that while many previously well-known virulence factors, such as suilysin, autolysin and muraminidase-released protein, were not expressed differentially, cell metabolism was downregulated in the ihk/irr deletion mutant. in addition, the oxidative-stress response gene for manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (mnsod) was also repressed significantly in the mutant. collectively, our data suggest that the ihk/irr tcs contributes to the virulence  of s. suis 2 strain 05zyh33, mainly through alteration of the bacterial cell metabolism.

TI  == haemophilus parasuis serovars isolated from pathological samples in northern italy.
AB  == from january 2007 to december 2011, a total of 106 haemophilus parasuis strains isolated from pigs were serotyped by agar gel diffusion test (dg). serovar 4 was  the most prevalent (24.5%), followed by serovar 13 (19.8%) and serovar 5 (11.3%). twenty-nine strains were non-typeable (27.3%). the strains were divided into two  groups, depending on whether they were isolated from specific pathological lesions of systemic disease such as polyserositis, arthritis or meningitis (73 cases of 106) or from the lower respiratory tract of pigs suffering from bronchopneumonia (33 cases of 106). serovars 4 and 13 had a higher prevalence in  systemic infection (polyserositis) than in respiratory disease only. pasteurella  multocida (14/106), streptococcus suis (7/106), actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (4/106), bordetella bronchiseptica (3/106) and arcanobacterium pyogenes (3/106) were isolated in association with h. parasuis.

TI  == streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant animal and human pathogen.
AB  == streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, has been receiving growing attention not only for its role in severe and increasingly reported infections in humans, but also for its involvement in drug resistance. recent studies and the analysis of sequenced genomes have been providing important insights into the s.  suis resistome, and have resulted in the identification of resistance determinants for tetracyclines, macrolides, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, antifolate drugs, streptothricin, and cadmium salts. resistance gene-carrying genetic elements described so far include integrative and conjugative elements, transposons, genomic islands, phages, and chimeric elements. some of these elements are similar to those reported in major streptococcal pathogens such as streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae and share the same chromosomal insertion sites. the available information strongly suggests that s. suis is an important antibiotic resistance reservoir that can contribute to the spread of resistance genes to the above-mentioned streptococci. s. suis is thus a paradigmatic example of possible intersections between animal and human resistomes.

TI  == microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both  swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium  pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9%  of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica  were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

TI  == htps, a novel immunogenic cell surface-exposed protein of streptococcus suis, confers protection in mice.
AB  == streptococcal histidine triad protein was identified recently as a cell surface-associated protein family. five members of this family (phta, phtb, phtd, phte and htpa), derived from streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, have been shown as antigens that confer protection to the host on infection. in this report, a gene sequence highly homologous to htpa and phtd (designated htps, the histidine triad protein of streptococcus suis) was identified from s. suis 2  chinese strain 05zyh33. our data revealed that htps is extremely conserved in s.  suis 2 and widely distributed in 83% (29/35) of 35 s. suis serotypes. it was also demonstrated by western blot and flow cytometry that htps is a cell surface-associated protein that was expressed during s. suis 2 infection. an antibody against htps could increase the deposition of human complement 3 on s. suis 2 and also enhance the clearance of s. suis 2 in whole blood. in addition, mice could be immunized against s. suis 2 infection and were well protected after immunization with recombinant htps.

TI  == different genetic elements carrying the tet(w) gene in two human clinical isolates of streptococcus suis.
AB  == the genetic support for tet(w), an emerging tetracycline resistance determinant,  was studied in two strains of streptococcus suis, ssca and ssud, both isolated in italy from patients with meningitis. two completely different tet(w)-carrying genetic elements, sharing only a tet(w)-containing segment barely larger than the gene, were found in the two strains. the one from strain ssca was nontransferable, and aside from an erm(b)-containing insertion, it closely resembled a genomic island recently described in an s. suis chinese human isolate in sequence, organization, and chromosomal location. the tet(w)-carrying genetic  element from strain ssud was transferable (at a low frequency) and, though apparently noninducible following mitomycin c treatment, displayed a typical phage organization and was named phissud.1. its full sequence was determined (60,711 bp), the highest blastn score being streptococcus pyogenes phim46.1. phissud.1 exhibited a unique combination of antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes. besides tet(w), it contained a mas (macrolide-aminoglycoside-streptothricin) fragment with an erm(b) gene having a deleted leader peptide and a cadc/cada cadmium efflux cassette. the mas fragment  closely resembled the one recently described in pneumococcal transposons tn6003 and tn1545. these resistance genes found in the phissud.1 phage scaffold differed from, but were in the same position as, cargo genes carried by other streptococcal phages. the chromosome integration site of phissud.1 was at the 3'  end of a conserved trna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene. this site, known to  be an insertional hot spot for mobile elements in s. pyogenes, might play a similar role in s. suis.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from respiratory tract of pigs in  poland between 2004 and 2008.
AB  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from nasal swabs and lungs of pigs, to 16 commonly used antibiotics, was determined by disc diffusion test. beta-lactams showed the best activity against streptococcus suis (s. suis) (> 99% of susceptible strains). the lowest sensitivity of s. suis was evidenced to: tylosin, tetracycline and neomycin (50%, 40% and 25%, respectively). isolates of  escherichia coli (e. coli) demonstrated the highest susceptibility to cephalosporin (85% strains), gentamicin and norfloxacin (over 74%). the lowest susceptibility of e. coli was demonstrated to tiamulin and penicillin (11.3% and  1.9%, respectively). over 80% of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (app) strains were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. the highest resistance of app, but demonstrated by below 20% of tested isolates only, was evidenced to neomycin and  lxs. isolates of pasteurella multocida (pm), haemophilus parasuis (hps) and arcanobacterium pyogenes (a. pyogenes) were highly susceptible to the most antibiotics included in the analysis. the comparison of the in vitro susceptibility of pathogens to the chemotherapeutics used on polish farms for the therapy of bacterial infection of pigs within the last five years and the last 10 years, showed an increasing percent of e. coli and s. suis strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics. it is also shown that pm, hps, app and a. pyogenes isolates were continuously susceptible to the most chemotherapeutics applied.

TI  == pathogenesis and antigenic characterization of a new east european subtype 3 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus isolate.
AB  == background: porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) is divided into a european and north american genotype. east european prrsv isolates have been found to be of the european genotype, but form different subtypes. in the present study, prrsv was isolated from a belarusian farm with reproductive and respiratory failure and designated "lena". analyses revealed that lena is a new east european subtype 3 prrsv isolate. the main purpose of this investigation was to study the pathogenesis and antigenic characteristics of prrsv (lena). results: obvious clinical and virological differences were observed between the animals inoculated with a recent european subtype 1 prrsv isolate (belgium a) and animals inoculated with prrsv (lena). three out of six pigs inoculated with prrsv (belgium a) had anorexia and low fever at 3, 4 and 5 days post-inoculation (dpi). high fever, anorexia and depression were prominent signs in most pigs inoculated  with prrsv (lena) between 2 and 28 dpi. four pigs out of ten died during the experiment. arcanobacterium pyogenes was isolated from lungs of one animal that died, and streptococcus suis was isolated from lungs of one animal that was euthanized. the difference in viral titres in sera from prrsv (belgium a) and prrsv (lena)-infected pigs was statistically significant (p < 0.05) at 7, 10, 14  and 21 dpi. the highest viral titres in sera ranged from 10(4.8) to 10(6.1) tcid50/ml for prrsv (lena) whereas they ranged from 10(3.1) to 10(4.8) tcid50/ml  for prrsv (belgium a).the replication of prrsv (lena) was further studied in depth. viral titres ranged from 10(2.5) tcid50/100 mg to 10(5.6) tcid50/100 mg in nasal secretions between 3 and 14 dpi and from 10(2.8) tcid50/100 mg to 10(4.6) tcid50/100 mg in tonsillar scrapings between 3 and 21 dpi. high viral titres were detected in lungs (10(2.3)-10(7.7) tcid50/g tissue), tonsils (10(2.0)-10(6.2) tcid50/g tissue) and inguinal lymph nodes (10(2.2)-10(6.6) tcid50/g tissue) until 35, 28 and 35 dpi, respectively.to examine the antigenic heterogeneity between the east european subtype 3 isolate lena, the european subtype 1 strain lelystad  and the north american strain us5, sets of monospecific polyclonal antisera were  tested in immunoperoxidase monolayer assays (ipmas) with homologous and heterologous viral antigens. heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres (p = 0.01-0.03) for antisera against prrsv (lena) at all sampling time points. for antisera against prrsv (lelystad) and prrsv (us5),  heterologous antibody titres were significantly lower than homologous titres at 14 and 21 dpi (p = 0.01-0.03) and at 10 and 14 dpi (p = 0.04), respectively. conclusions: lena is a highly pathogenic east european subtype 3 prrsv, which differs from european subtype 1 lelystad and north american us5 strains at both the genetic and antigenic level.

TI  == the changing faces of streptococcus antigen i/ii polypeptide family adhesins.
AB  == streptococcus mutans antigen i/ii (agi/ii) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in gram-positive bacteria. it mediates attachment of s. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. the agi/ii family polypeptides recognize salivary  glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation,  tissue invasion and immune modulation. the genes encoding agi/ii family polypeptides are found among streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. suis. evidence of functionalities for different regions of the agi/ii proteins has emerged. a sequence motif within the c-terminal portion of streptococcus gordonii sspb (agi/ii) is bound by porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. the significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. a new picture emerges of the central v (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench,  being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an n-terminal alpha-helix and a c-terminal polyproline helix. this presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.

TI  == uncovering newly emerging variants of streptococcus suis, an important zoonotic agent.
AB  == streptococcus suis is recognized as a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent. two large-scale outbreaks of severe s. suis epidemics occurred in china in 1998 and 2005 that posed serious concerns to public health and challenged the conventional conception that opportunistic infections of s. suis serotype 2 (ss2) in humans were only sporadic cases. an extensive, collaborative  study on chinese ss2 variants, which exhibit strong invasiveness and high pathogenicity, has resulted in the description of a new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (stss) and a putative pathogenicity island (termed 89k). the abbreviation of stss is used for the severe disease caused by both staphylococci and streptococci. the main virulence factors involved in stss  caused by either staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes consist of so-called superantigens or molecules that trigger a nonspecific, uncontrolled activation of t cells and massive cytokine release. however, although a collection of new virulence factors have been described, no superantigen candidates have been found for ss2 strains, implying that a different mechanism could be involved in the stss form caused by ss2 variants.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

AB  == we investigated culture supernatant proteins from the m1 serotype of streptococcus pyogenes by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and peptide mass mapping analysis, and characterized the single protein spots. among them, we analysed the spy0747 protein. this protein is homologous to the ssna protein, a cell-wall-located dnase expressed in streptococcus suis serotype 2. we designated the spy0747 protein as spna. spna protein was also detected in the insoluble fraction of whole-cell lysates using shotgun proteomic analysis, suggesting that  spna is also located in the cell wall. spna was expressed as a glutathione s-transferase-fusion protein in escherichia coli. we confirmed that the recombinant protein had dnase activity that was dependent on ca(2+) and mg(2+), like ssna. blood bactericidal assays and mouse infection model experiments showed that the spna knockout strain was less virulent than the parental strain, thus suggesting that spna could play an important role in virulence. using pcr, we found that the spna gene was present in all clinical s. pyogenes strains we examined. our results, together with a previous report identifying spy0747 as a surface-associated protein, suggest that spna is an important cell-wall-located dnase that is generally produced in s. pyogenes and is involved in virulence.

TI  == identification and characterization of inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase in streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  == streptococcus suis type 2 is a swine pathogen responsible for diverse diseases. although many virulent factors have been identified and studied, relatively little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms of type 2. the aim of the study was to identify and understand the characterization of inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase (impdh). a 957-bp gene, impdh, was identified in the virulent s. suis serotype 2 (ss2), and analysis of the predicted impdh sequence revealed imp  dehydrogenase/gmp reductase domain. the gene encoding for the impdh of s. suis was cloned and sequenced. the dna sequence contained an open reading frame encoding for a 318 amino acid polypeptide exhibiting 23% sequence identity with the impdh from streptococcus pyogenes (yp281355) and streptococcus pneumoniae (zp00404150). using the pet(32) expression plasmid, the impdh gene was inducibly  overexpressed in escherichia coli to produce impdh with a hexahistidyl n-terminus to permit its purification. the (his)6 impdh protein was found to possess functional impdh enzymatic activity after the purification. the impdh-knockout ss2 mutant ( delta impdh) constructed in this study was slower in growth and one  ph unit higher than ss2-h after 6 h of culturing, and found to be attenuated in mouse models of infection for 2.5 times and not be capable of causing death in porcine models of infection in contrast with the parent ss2-h.

TI  == [antibiotics susceptibility of streptococcus and enterococcus: data of onerba network].
AB  == this work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae), or in  animals (streptococcus suis and streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. data were recorded since 1996 through the onerba networks. s. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. however, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in s. pyogenes. in 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. a similar trend was observed for s. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals s. suis and s. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. in enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in e. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of e. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. from 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in french hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. however, the  recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in french hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. such trend in macrolide resistance among s. pyogenes or s. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.

TI  == evaluation of pyelonephritis in culled indoor and outdoor high parity sows.
AB  == the present trial was conducted in hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor  high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. all rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. in outdoor sows escherichia (e.) coli and actinobaculum (a.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. besides e. coli and a. suis, clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (staphylococcus (s.) albus,  s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. were  concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida, proteus spp. were concurrently found beside e. coli and a. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. in indoor sows e. coli and a. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida,  proteus spp. were found beside e. coli and a. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. however only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus  faecalis), staphylococci (s. albus, s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. implications: in eastern european climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.

TI  == the streptococcus pyogenes serotype m49 nra-ralp3 transcriptional regulatory network and its control of virulence factor expression from the novel eno ralp3 epf saga pathogenicity region.
AB  == many streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]) virulence factor- and transcriptional regulator-encoding genes cluster together in discrete genomic regions. nra is a central regulator of the fct region. previous studies exclusively described nra as a transcriptional repressor of adhesin and toxin genes. here transcriptome and proteome analysis of a serotype m49 gas strain and  an isogenic nra mutant of this strain revealed the complete nra regulon profile.  nra is active in all growth phases tested, with the largest regulon in the transition phase. almost exclusively, virulence factor-encoding genes are repressed by nra; these genes include the gas pilus operon, the capsule synthesis operon, the cytolysin-mediated translocation system genes, all mga region core virulence genes, and genes encoding other regulators, like the ihk/irr system, rgg, and two additional rofa-like protein family regulators. surprisingly, our experiments revealed that nra additionally acts as a positive regulator, mostly for genes encoding proteins and enzymes with metabolic functions. epidemiological investigations revealed strong genetic linkage of one particular nra-repressed regulator, ralp3 (spy0735), with a gene encoding epf (extracellular protein factor from streptococcus suis). in a serotype-specific fashion, this ralp3 epf gene block is integrated, most likely via transposition, into the eno saga virulence gene block, which is present in all gas serotypes. in gas serotypes m1, m4, m12, m28, and m49 this novel discrete genetic region is therefore designated  the eno ralp3 epf saga (eres) pathogenicity region. functional experiments showed that epf is a novel gas plasminogen-binding protein and revealed that ralp3 activity counteracts nra and msmr regulatory activity. in addition to the mga and fct regions, the eres region is the third discrete chromosomal pathogenicity region. all of these regions are transcriptionally linked, adding another level of complexity to the known gas growth phase-dependent regulatory network.

TI  == evolution of the core and pan-genome of streptococcus: positive selection, recombination, and genome composition.
AB  == background: the genus streptococcus is one of the most diverse and important human and agricultural pathogens. this study employs comparative evolutionary analyses of 26 streptococcus genomes to yield an improved understanding of the relative roles of recombination and positive selection in pathogen adaptation to  their hosts. results: streptococcus genomes exhibit extreme levels of evolutionary plasticity, with high levels of gene gain and loss during species and strain evolution. s. agalactiae has a large pan-genome, with little recombination in its core-genome, while s. pyogenes has a smaller pan-genome and  much more recombination of its core-genome, perhaps reflecting the greater habitat, and gene pool, diversity for s. agalactiae compared to s. pyogenes. core-genome recombination was evident in all lineages (18% to 37% of the core-genome judged to be recombinant), while positive selection was mainly observed during species differentiation (from 11% to 34% of the core-genome). positive selection pressure was unevenly distributed across lineages and biochemical main role categories. s. suis was the lineage with the greatest level of positive selection pressure, the largest number of unique loci selected, and the largest amount of gene gain and loss. conclusion: recombination is an important evolutionary force in shaping streptococcus genomes, not only in the acquisition of significant portions of the genome as lineage specific loci, but also in facilitating rapid evolution of the core-genome. positive selection, although undoubtedly a slower process, has nonetheless played an important role in adaptation of the core-genome of different streptococcus species to different  hosts.

TI  == a glimpse of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome from comparative genomics of s. suis 2 chinese isolates.
AB  == background: streptococcus suis serotype 2 (ss2) is an important zoonotic pathogen, causing more than 200 cases of severe human infection worldwide, with the hallmarks of meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, etc. very recently, ss2 has been recognized as an etiological agent for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (stss), which was originally associated with streptococcus pyogenes (gas) in streptococci. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying stss are poorly understood. methods and findings: to elucidate the genetic determinants of stss caused by ss2, whole genome sequencing of 3 different chinese ss2 strains was undertaken. comparative genomics accompanied by several lines of experiments, including experimental animal infection, pcr assay, and expression analysis, were utilized to further dissect a candidate pathogenicity island (pai). here we show, for the first time, a novel molecular insight into chinese isolates of highly invasive ss2, which caused two large-scale human stss outbreaks in china. a candidate pai of approximately 89 kb in length, which is designated 89k and specific for chinese ss2 virulent isolates, was investigated at the genomic level. it shares the universal properties of pais such as distinct gc content, consistent with its pivotal role in stss and high virulence. conclusions: to our  knowledge, this is the first pai candidate from s. suis worldwide. our finding thus sheds light on stss triggered by ss2 at the genomic level, facilitates further understanding of its pathogenesis and points to directions of development on some effective strategies to combat highly pathogenic ss2 infections.

TI  == identification of a novel virulence determinant with serum opacification activity in streptococcus suis.
AB  == streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a porcine and human pathogen with adhesive and invasive properties. in other streptococci, large surface-associated proteins (>100 kda) of the mscramm family (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) are key players in interactions with host tissue. in this study, we identified a novel opacity factor of s. suis (ofs) with structural homology to members of the mscramm family. the n-terminal region of ofs is homologous to the respective regions of fibronectin-binding protein a (fnba) of streptococcus dysgalactiae and the serum opacity factor (sof) of streptococcus pyogenes. similar to these two proteins, the n-terminal domain of ofs opacified horse serum. serum opacification activity was detectable in sodium dodecyl sulfate extracts of wild-type s. suis but not in extracts of isogenic ofs knockout mutants. heterologous expression of ofs in lactococcus lactis demonstrated that a high level of expression of ofs is sufficient to provide surface-associated serum opacification activity. furthermore, serum opacification could be inhibited by an antiserum against recombinant ofs. the c-terminal repetitive sequence elements of ofs differed significantly from the respective repeat regions of fnba and sof as well as from the consensus sequence of the fibronectin-binding repeats of mscramms. accordingly, fibronectin binding was not detectable in recombinant ofs. to investigate the putative function of ofs in the pathogenesis of invasive s. suis diseases, piglets were experimentally infected with an isogenic mutant strain in which the ofs gene had been knocked out by an in-frame deletion. the mutant was severely attenuated in virulence but not in colonization, demonstrating that ofs represents a novel virulence determinant of  s. suis.

AB  == to obtain better insights into the possible exchange of resistance genes between  human and animal streptococci, the sequences of the erm (b) genes of streptococcal isolates from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, chickens, and calves were compared. identical erm (b) gene sequences were present in strains from humans, pigs, pork carcasses, and calves. during in vitro mating experiments, the erm (b) gene was exchanged between porcine streptococcus suis and human s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and s. oralis strains. the presence of different tetracycline resistance genes and the int tn 1545 gene was determined in animal streptococci carrying the erm (b) gene. although tet(m) and int tn 1545 genes were detected in 24% of the porcine and pork carcass streptococcal strains, the tet(o) gene was the predominant tetracycline resistance gene in these strains (81%). the latter gene was co-transferred with the erm (b) gene from porcine s. suis strains to human streptococci in the mating experiments. these results show  that, identical erm (b) gene sequences were present in animal and human streptococci and that transfer of the erm (b) gene from porcine s. suis to human  streptococci and vice versa is possible, but probably occurs at a low frequency.

TI  == pulmonary infections in swine induce altered porcine surfactant protein d expression and localization to dendritic cells in bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue.
AB  == surfactant protein d (sp-d) is a pattern-recognition molecule of the innate immune system that recognizes various microbial surface-specific carbohydrate and lipid patterns. in vitro data has suggested that this binding may lead to increased microbial association with macrophages and dendritic cells. the aim of  the present in vivo study was to study the expression of porcine sp-d (psp-d) in  the lung during different pulmonary bacterial infections, and the effect of the routes of infection on this expression was elucidated. furthermore, the aim was to study the in vivo spatial relationship among psp-d, pathogens, phagocytic cells and dendritic cells. lung tissue was collected from experimental and natural bronchopneumonias caused by actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae or staphylococcus aureus, and from embolic and diffuse interstitial pneumonia, caused by staph. aureus or arcanobacterium pyogenes and streptococcus suis serotype 2, respectively. by comparing normal and diseased lung tissue from the same lungs, increased diffuse psp-d immunoreactivity was seen in the surfactant in both acute and chronic bronchopneumonias, while such increased expression of psp-d was generally not present in the interstitial pneumonias. co-localization of psp-d, alveolar macrophages and bacteria was demonstrated, and psp-d showed a  patchy distribution on the membranes of alveolar macrophages. sp-d immunoreactivity was intracellular in dendritic cells. the dendritic cells were identified by their morphology, the absence of macrophage marker immunoreactivity and the presence of dendritic cell marker immunoreactivity. increased expression  of psp-d in the surfactant coincided with presence of psp-d-positive dendritic cells in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (balt), indicating a possible transport of psp-d through the specialized m cells overlying (balt). in conclusion, we have shown that psp-d expression in the lung surfactant is induced by bacterial infection by an aerogenous route rather than by a haematogenous route, and that the protein interacts specifically with alveolar macrophages and  with dendritic cells in microbial-induced balt. the function of the interaction between psp-d and dendritic cells in balt remain unclear, but psp-d could represent a link between the innate and adaptive immune system, facilitating the  bacterial antigen presentation by dendritic cells in balt.

TI  == generation of transposon insertion mutant libraries for gram-positive bacteria by electroporation of phage mu dna transposition complexes.
AB  == transposon mutagenesis is a powerful technique for generating collections of insertion mutants for genetic studies. this paper describes how phage mu dna transposition complexes, transpososomes, can be exploited for gene delivery to efficiently introduce selectable markers to genomes of gram-positive bacteria. mu transpososomes were assembled in vitro with custom-designed mini-mu transposons,  concentrated, and electroporated into cells of three gram-positive bacterial species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus suis. within cells, the complexes reproduced an authentic dna transposition reaction and integrated the delivered transposons into the bacterial genomes, yielding single-copy insertions. the integration efficiency among different species and strains of gram-positive bacteria ranged from 1x10(1) to 2x10(4) c.f.u. (mug introduced transposon dna)(-1). the strategy should be applicable to a variety of other gram-positive species after initial optimization of certain key factors affecting transposon delivery, such as the preparation method of competent cells  and physical parameters of electroporation. this study extends the scope of the mu transpososome delivery-based genomic dna integration strategy to gram-positive bacteria. thus, a straightforward generation of sizeable mutant banks is feasible for these bacteria, potentiating several types of genomic-level approaches for studies of a variety of important bacterial processes, such as pathogenicity.

TI  == fluid- or surface-phase human salivary scavenger protein gp340 exposes different  bacterial recognition properties.
AB  == salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein gp340 aggregates streptococci and other bacteria as part of the host innate defense system at mucosal surfaces. in this article, we have investigated the properties of fluid-phase gp340 and hydroxylapatite surface-adsorbed gp340 in aggregation and adherence, respectively, of viridans group streptococci (e.g., streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans), non-viridans group streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus suis), and oral actinomyces. fluid-phase gp340 and surface-phase gp340 bioforms were differentially recognized by streptococci, which formed three phenotypic groupings according to their modes of interaction with gp340. group i streptococci were aggregated by and adhered to gp340, and group ii streptococci preferentially adhered to surface-bound gp340, while group  iii streptococci were preferentially aggregated by gp340. each species of streptococcus tested was found to contain strains representative of at least two  of these gp340 interaction groupings. the gp340 interaction modes i to iii and sugar specificities of gp340 binding strains coincided for several species. many  gp340 interactions were sialidase sensitive, and each of the interaction modes (i to iii) for s. gordonii was correlated with a variant of sialic acid specificity. adherence of s. gordonii dl1 (challis) to surface-bound gp340 was dependent upon  expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin hsa. however, aggregation of cells  by fluid-phase gp340 was independent of hsa and involved sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family) polypeptides. conversely, both gp340-mediated aggregation and adherence of s. mutans ng8 involved antigen i/ii polypeptide. deletion of the mga virulence regulator gene in s. pyogenes resulted in increased cell aggregation by gp340. these results suggest that salivary gp340 recognizes different bacterial receptors according to whether gp340 is present in the fluid phase or surface bound. this phase-associated differential recognition by gp340 of streptococcal species of different levels of virulence and diverse origins may mediate alternative host responses to commensal or pathogenic bacterial phenotypes.

TI  == [evaluation of prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].
AB  == the need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to  identify streptococcal group antigens (a, b, c, d, f, and g) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. the prolex agglutination tests (pro-lab diagnostics, richmond hill, ontario, canada), distributed in france by i2a, have  been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the national reference center for streptococci. the results obtained with the prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 streptococcus pyogenes, 21 streptococcus agalactiae, 33 streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group c and 27 group g, and 5 streptococcus porcinus including 4 group b). four differences between unexpected agglutinations (a or f) and species identifications have been obtained. these differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii,  streptococcus infantarius, and streptococcus suis. the anti-d reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. moreover, the use of prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens.

AB  == streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a swine pathogen responsible for diverse diseases and may be present in the tonsils of pigs which show no sign of illness. because adhesion to host cells may be important in the carrier state, this study  was undertaken to characterize a 39 kda surface protein identified as a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), possibly implicated in the adhesion of the bacteria. the gene encoding for the gapdh of s. suis was cloned and sequenced. the dna sequence contained an open reading frame encoding for a 336 amino acid polypeptide exhibiting 95% sequence identity with the gapdh from streptococcus pyogenes and from other streptococci. using the qiaexpress expression plasmids, the gapdh gene was inducibly overexpressed in e. coli to produce gapdh with a hexahistidyl n-terminus to permit its purification. the (his)6gapdh protein was found to possess functional gapdh enzymatic activity after the purification. an adherence assay with s. suis and porcine tracheal rings pre-incubated with (his)6gapdh and non-incubated rings was showed a significant reduction in the adhesion of s. suis in the (his)6gapdh pre-incubated rings compared to the non-incubated rings. the gapdh protein of s. suis seems to  be involved in the first steps of the bacterial adhesion to host cells.

TI  == identification and characterization of two temperature-induced surface-associated proteins of streptococcus suis with high homologies to members of the arginine deiminase system of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the present study was performed to identify stress-induced putative virulence proteins of streptococcus suis. for this, protein expression patterns of streptococci grown at 32, 37, and 42 degrees c were compared by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. temperature shifts from 32 and 37 to 42 degrees c induced expression of two cell wall-associated proteins with apparent molecular masses of approximately 47 and 53 kda. amino-terminal sequence analysis of the two proteins indicated homologies of the 47-kda protein with an ornithine  carbamoyltransferase (oct) from streptococcus pyogenes and of the 53-kda protein  with the streptococcal acid glycoprotein (sagp) from s. pyogenes, an arginine deiminase (ad) recently proposed as a putative virulence factor. cloning and sequencing the genes encoding the putative oct and ad of s. suis, octs and adis,  respectively, revealed that they had 81.2 (octs) and 80.2% (adis) identity with the respective genes of s. pyogenes. both genes belong to the ad system, also found in other bacteria. southern hybridization analysis demonstrated the presence of the adis gene in all 42 serotype 2 and 9 s. suis strains tested. in 9 of these 42 strains, selected randomly, we confirmed expression of the adis protein, homologous to sagp, by immunoblot analysis using a specific antiserum against the sagp of s. pyogenes. in all strains ad activity was detected. furthermore, by immunoelectron microscopy using the anti-s. pyogenes sagp antiserum we were able to demonstrate that the adis protein is expressed on the streptococcal surface in association with the capsular polysaccharides but is not coexpressed with them.

TI  == genetic bases and medical relevance of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in pathogenic streptococci.
AB  == many streptococci are human and/or animal pathogens and the frequent cause of life-threatening diseases. among various streptococcal virulence factors, capsular polysaccharides (cps) are recognized as essential to prevent phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. in the last decade, an impressive advance on the knowledge of the genetic bases underlying capsule formation has been achieved. the capsular gene cluster driving the formation of the cp of streptococcus pyogenes and other hyaluronate-producing streptococci, represents one of the simplest cases of gene organization to synthesize a capsule. a more complex situation has been found in streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus suis, and other streptococci. on the whole, there exists a direct relationship between the structural and chemical complexity of the repeating unit of the polysaccharide and the number of genes found in the corresponding capsular locus. streptococcal vaccines, either polysaccharide or conjugate, are currently being tested in clinical trials to overcome the rise of  worldwide antibiotic resistance, although, for different reasons, none of these vaccines are expected to provide the required full coverage in a near future. this concern has prompted to explore alternative possibilities with an improved therapeutic potential against streptococcal diseases.

AB  == many surface proteins which are covalently linked to the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria have a consensus c-terminal motif, leu-pro-x-thr-gly (lpxtg). this sequence is cleaved, and the processed protein is attached to an amino group of a cross-bridge in the peptidoglycan by a specific enzyme called sortase. using the type strain of streptococcus suis, nctc 10234, we found five genes encoding proteins that were homologous to sortases of other bacteria and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genetic regions. one gene, designated  srta, was linked to gyra, as were the sortase and sortase-like genes of other streptococci. three genes, designated srtb, srtc, and srtd, were tandemly clustered in a different location, where there were three segments of directly repeated sequences of approximately 110 bp in close vicinity. the remaining gene, designated srte, was located separately on the chromosome with a pseudogene which may encode a transposase. the deduced amino acid sequences of the five srt proteins showed 18 to 31% identity with the sortases of streptococcus gordonii and staphylococcus aureus, except that srta of s. suis had 65% identity with that of s. gordonii. isogenic mutants deficient for srta, srtbcd, or srte were generated by allelic exchanges. the protein fraction which was released from partially purified cell walls by digestion with n-acetylmuramidase was profiled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. more than 15 of the protein spots were missing in the profile of the srta mutant compared with that of the parent strain, and this phenotype was completely complemented by srta cloned from s. suis. four genes encoding proteins corresponding to such spots were identified and sequenced. the deduced translational products of the four genes possessed the lpxtg motif in their c-terminal regions. on the other hand, the protein spots that were missing in the srta mutant appeared in the profiles of the srtbcd and srte mutants. these results provide evidence that the cell wall sorting system involving srta is also present in s. suis.

TI  == prevalence and mechanism of resistance against macrolides and lincosamides in streptococcus suis isolates.
AB  == eighty-seven streptococcus suis isolates recovered in 1999-2000 from diseased pigs, all from different farms, were screened for resistance against macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics by the disk diffusion and agar dilution test and a pcr assay, amplifying the ermb gene and the mefa/e gene. seventy-one percent of the isolates showed constitutive resistance to macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics (mls(b)-phenotype). all these isolates were positive for the ermb gene in the pcr, but negative for the mefa/e gene. for all strains minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against five other antimicrobial agents were determined. all strains were susceptible to penicillin. ninety-nine percent of the isolates were susceptible to enrofloxacin and tiamulin. eighty-five percent of the strains were resistant to doxycycline. a 540bp fragment of the ermb genes  of eight s. suis strains was sequenced and compared with ermb genes of five s. pneumoniae and five s. pyogenes strains of human origin. a 100% homology was found between these fragments in seven s. suis, one s. pneumoniae and three of the s. pyogenes isolates. this study demonstrates that resistance against macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b is widespread in s. suis and mediated by ribosome methylation, encoded by the ermb gene.

TI  == [pneumonia in calves: characterization of the bacterial spectrum and the resistance patterns to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == the population under study included young calves with pneumonia (group a, n = 13) and their controls (group b, n = 9), as well as older calves from which the lungs with (group c, n = 90) or without (group d, n = 10) lesions were collected after  slaughter. arcanobacterium pyogenes was the organism most commonly isolated from  calves in group a (46%), followed by haemophilus somnus (23%), mannheimia haemolytica (15%), streptococcus suis and pasteurella multocida (7.7% each). only s. suis (22%) and p. multocida (11%) were found in group b. p. multocida was isolated from 32% group c calves, h. somnus from 11%, a. pyogenes from 7.8%, m. haemolytica from 2.2% and s. suis from 1.1%. no specific pathogens were isolated  in group d. prevalence of mycoplasma bovis infection was 69% in group a and 37% in group c. ninety-eight strains were tested for resistance to antibiotics. resistance to penicillin and ampicillin was present only in m. haemolytica (46%). high percentages of resistant strains were observed for streptomycin (48-100%), tetracycline (15-43%), sulfonamides alone (14-100%) or in combination with trimethoprim (0-100%). therapeutic approaches to bacterial calf pneumonia in the  area under study should be modified according to the isolated bacterial population, the observed antimicrobial resistances and the growing importance of  mycoplasma bovis.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == microbiology and pathology of fibrinous pericarditis in danish slaughter pigs.
AB  == the prevalence of fibrinous pericarditis detected at slaughter in danish slaughter pigs is approximately 0.02%. the microbiology and pathology of this disorder was studied through 46 field cases collected at slaughter from may 1994  to august 1995. mycoplasmas (mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, m. hyosynoviae and m. hyorhinis) were isolated from the pericardium in 38 cases and from the joints in  six. m. hyopneumoniae dominated with 33 isolates from the pericardium. actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was isolated from the pericardium in three cases  (as mono-infection in one and together with m. hyopneumoniae in two cases) and actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from the pericardium twice (as mono-infection in one case and together with m. hyopneumoniae in another). a. pyogenes was also  present in the lung, liver and kidney in one of these cases. streptococcus suis was isolated together with mycoplasmas from the pericardium in three cases. the pericardium was sterile in three cases and contained a low grade mixed flora in two; the latter is believed to be a result of the slaughter procedure rather than an infection. no chlamydiae were found in connection with the microbiological examination. parvovirus was found in one case in the pericardium and in two cases in the spleen. forty-five cases were subacute to chronic. the gross pathological  examination showed that bronchopneumonia, chronic pleuritis and synovitis or a low grade arthritis occurred in most cases. only the arthritic lesions are believed to be pathogenetically concurrent with the pericarditis. slight evidence of stasis of the liver and/or periangiolar edema was present in six cases. the histopathological examination confirmed the above mentioned findings. bacterial colonies were found within the fibrinous layer on the pericardium in all cases from which either a. pleuropneumoniae, a. pyogenes or s. suis was isolated. it is concluded that in this study mycoplasmas, particularly m. hyopneumoniae, are the  more likely cause of fibrinous pericarditis in slaughter pigs.

TI  == description of an albumin binding activity for streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  == this study was undertaken to investigate the binding activity of streptococcus suis serotype 2 to albumin. using flow cytometry we observed a binding activity of s. suis to albumin for virulent as well as for avirulent isolates. western immunoblots analysis revealed that a 39-kda s. suis protein was responsible, at least in part, for this binding activity. this protein showed high n-terminal homology (95.6% for the first 23 residues) with a group a streptococcus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. furthermore, the addition of albumin to the culture broth resulted in an increase in the virulence of s. suis strains in  mice. these results suggest that an interaction with albumin could play a role in the pathogenesis of s. suis serotype 2 infections.

TI  == bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs associated with endocarditis, especially the isolation of streptococcus suis.
AB  == bacterial isolation from slaughtered pigs with endocarditis was carried out from  1985 to 1994. a total of 495 (0.025%) out of 2,006,127 pigs were diagnosed as having endocarditis. though bacteria were significantly isolated from 399 of the  495 pigs, bacteria could not be isolated in 96 pigs (19.4%). in 11 pigs, 2 bacterial species were isolated from heart lesion. streptococcus suis was isolated from 127 cases (25.7%), streptococcus dysgalactiae from 75 (15.2%), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae from 63 (12.7%), actinomyces pyogenes from 39 (7.9%), pasteurella multocida from 11 (2.2%). staphylococcus aureus from 10 (2.0%), and streptococcus porcinus from 8 (1.6%). among the 99 isolates biochemically identified as s. suis, the major serotype was s. suis type 2 (35.4%). the remainder of the typable isolates were identified as serotypes 1/2 (2.0%) and 9 (1.0%). a total of 61 isolates (61.6%) were untypable.

TI  == enhancement of host resistance to bacterial infections in normal and immunosuppressed mice with actinobacillus suis.
AB  == a single intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation of heat-killed actinobacillus suis atcc 15,557 (as 15,557) into normal and immunosuppressed (dexamethasone-treated) mice  led to remarkable nonspecific resistance to ip challenge with lethal doses of opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans. the duration of this enhanced protective action and the minimal effective dose, in normal mice, induced by as 15,557 were superior to those induced by other bacterial immunostimulants such as heat-killed lavtobacillus casei yit 9018 (lc 9018) and penicillin-treated streptococcus pyogenes, su (ok-432). in immunosuppressed mice; the reduced in vivo killing activity of peritoneal exudate cells (pecs) against p. aeruginosa infection was markedly augmented by ip injection of as 15,557. the degree of pec  augmentation induced by as 15,557 was higher than that induced by lc 9018 or by ok-432. the toxicity and histopathological changes associated with as 15557 were  very low, as compared with those by produced by lc 9018 and ok-432. the results suggest that as 15,557, which showed a strong resistance-enhancing capacity against opportunistic bacterial infections, may be a useful bacterial immunostimulant.

TI  == an abattoir survey of pneumonia and pleuritis in slaughter weight swine from 9 selected herds. iv. bacteriological findings in chronic pneumonic lesions.
AB  == a total of 855 pig lungs were collected at slaughter and evaluated macroscopically. bacteriological examinations were carried out on tissue samples  from chronic pleuropneumonic lesions (n = 196) and from chronic bronchopneumonic  lesions with suppuration (n = 14). samples from normal lung tissue (n = 22) were  also included. pasteurella multocida was isolated from 54%, actinobacillus (haemophilus) pleuropneumoniae from 11%, and streptococcus spp. from 14% of the pneumonic lesions, respectively. from normal lung tissue p. multocida was isolated from 3 (14%) of the samples, a. pleuropneumoniae was not recovered and streptococci were isolated from only 1 (5%) of these samples. the above mentioned bacterial species were recovered either in pure cultures or mixed with various other microbes. a total of 109 p. multocida strains were further characterized by capsular serotyping and testing for production of dermonecrotic toxin. ninety-nine (91%) of the strains were capsular type a 10 (9%) were type d. out of the type a and the type d strains 94% and 90% were toxigenic, respectively. most  of the a. pleuropneumoniae strains were serotype 2. strains of serotypes 1 and 7  were also identified. the majority of the streptococci were identified as either  streptococcus suis or streptococcus dysgalactiae. actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from 14% of the lesions and anaerobic bacteria from 18%, respectively. the significance of the various bacterial species in relation to the development  of chronic pneumonic lesions is discussed. special attention is paid to p. multocida, and it is concluded that this bacterial species is probably of importance for the development of both types of chronic pneumonias.

TI  == streptococcus suis infection in swine. a sixteen month study.
AB  == a total of 349 isolates of streptococcus suis retrieved from different tissues from diseased pigs were examined in this study. only 48% of them could be categorized as one of serotypes 1 to 8 and 1/2. among typable isolates, serotype  2 was the most prevalent (23%), followed by serotype 3 (10%). the majority of all isolates originated from lungs, meninges/brain, and multiple tissues. forty-one percent of typable isolates and 33% of untypable isolates were retrieved in pure  culture. other isolates were found in conjunction with pasteurella multocida, escherichia coli, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, actinomyces pyogenes, and other streptococci. typable s. suis isolates were more frequently isolated from pigs between five and ten weeks of age, while untypable isolates were mostly found in animals aged more than 24 weeks. no obvious monthly and/or seasonal variation of the prevalence of isolation of s. suis could be detected.
