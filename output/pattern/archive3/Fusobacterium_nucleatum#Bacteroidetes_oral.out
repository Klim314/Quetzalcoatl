nanoparticle-encapsulated chlorhexidine against oral bacterial biofilms.
background: chlorhexidine (chx) is a widely used antimicrobial agent in dentistry. herein, we report the synthesis of a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated pure chx (nano-chx), and its mechanical profile and antimicrobial properties against oral biofilms. methodology/principal findings: the release of chx from the nano-chx was characterized by uv/visible absorption spectroscopy. the antimicrobial properties of nano-chx were evaluated in both planktonic and biofilm modes of representative oral pathogenic bacteria. the nano-chx demonstrated potent antibacterial effects on planktonic bacteria and mono-species biofilms at the concentrations of 50-200 microg/ml against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and enterococccus faecalis. moreover, nano-chx effectively suppressed multi-species biofilms such as s. mutans, f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis up to 72 h. conclusions/significance: this pioneering study demonstrates the potent antibacterial effects of the nano-chx on oral biofilms, and it may be developed as a novel and promising anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.
quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.
antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.
proteomics of streptococcus gordonii within a model developing oral microbial community.
background: streptococcus gordonii is one of several species that can initiate the formation of oral biofilms that develop into the complex multispecies microbial communities referred to as dental plaque. it is in the context of dental plaque that periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis cause disease. we have previously reported a whole cell quantitative proteomics investigation of p. gingivalis in a model dental plaque community of s. gordonii, p. gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. here we report the adaptation of s. gordonii to the same model. results: 1122 s. gordonii proteins were detected in s. gordonii control samples, 915 in communities with f. nucleatum, 849 with p. gingivalis, and 649 with all three organisms. quantitative comparisons showed extensive proteome changes in association with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis individually or both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum together. the changes were species specific, though the p. gingivalis interaction may be dominant, indicated by large differences between the proteomes with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis but limited changes between communities with p. gingivalis or both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. the results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david. extensive changes were seen in nutrition pathways with increases in energy metabolism and changes in the resulting byproducts, while the acid and sugar repressed pts (phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system) sugar transport systems showed decreases. these results were seen across all the multispecies samples, though with different profiles according to the partner species. f. nucleatum association decreased proteins for the metabolic end products acetate and ethanol but increased lactate, the primary source of acidity from streptococcal cultures. p. gingivalis containing samples had a reduction in levels of proteins for ethanol and formate but increased proteins for both acetate and lactate production. the communities also showed increases in exopolysaccharide synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and oxidative stress protection and decreases in adhesion and transporter proteins. conclusion: this study showed that s. gordonii demonstrates species specific responses during interactions with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis. extensive changes were seen in energy metabolism and byproduct production implicating nutrient transfer as an important community interaction.
autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of gram-negative anaerobes. autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a universal quorum sensing (qs) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. as fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that ai-2 of f. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified f. nucleatum ai-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between f. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). then we tested the effect of two qs inhibitors (qsis), (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on ai-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. f. nucleatum ai-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between f. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of which were inhibited by the qsis. f. nucleatum ai-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the qsis. our results demonstrate that f. nucleatum ai-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.
antimicrobial efficacy of denture adhesives on some oral malodor-related microbes.
the objective of the study was to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of three denture adhesives toward streptococcus oralis, mutans, prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum. adhesives used were corega ultra((r)), fixodent pro original((r)) and biotene((r)) denture grip. for streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mutans, four tubes of trypticase soy broth 10 ml and 1 g denture of adhesive were used. in addition four tubes of trypticase soy broth 10 ml without any denture adhesive was employed as control. for prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum, four tubes of thioglycolate 10 ml and 1 g denture adhesive were used for each one, while four tubes of thioglycolate 10 ml without adhesive served as control. all samples were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees c. after 48 h, the number of colonies was counted and the mean was extracted as cfu/ml. the results were evaluated with anova on ranked data and tukey's post hoc test at alpha = 0.05. streptococcus oralis, mutans, prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum showed decreased number of colonies for each denture adhesive compared to the control. under the conditions of this in vitro study, all the tested denture adhesives showed antimicrobial efficacy. however, in contrast to the hypothesis, there were differences among them. corega ultra((r)) and biotene((r)) denture grip were more effective for all the tested oral malodor-related microbes than fixodent pro original((r)).
garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.
vaccination of mice with porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum modulates the inflammatory response, but fails to prevent experimental periodontitis.
aim: to assess the potential of using vaccination with porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum, in modulating local subcutaneous inflammatory response and alveolar bone loss following coinfection with both bacteria. materials and methods: mice were immunized against either p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. the cytokine response to mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum was evaluated using the subcutaneous chamber model. the alveolar bone loss induced by oral mixed infection was evaluated by micro-ct using the experimental periodontitis model. serum levels of specific antibodies were determined by elisa. results: vaccination with either bacterium produced a specific humoral response before infection. animals immunized against either bacteria following a mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, showed decreased tnfalpha (but not il-1beta) levels as compared with non-immunized animals. however, the vaccination did not change the level of mixed infection-induced alveolar bone loss when compared with non-immunized animals. six weeks following the oral mixed infection, specific antibody titres remained high. furthermore, specific antibodies against the non-immunized bacterium were present at high levels. conclusions: while vaccination produced specific antibodies and suppressed the inflammatory response, it failed to prevent or reduce the progression of experimental periodontitis induced by mixed infection with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.
the antimicrobial efficacy of commercial dentifrices.
this investigation compared the effects of a fluoride dentifrice and toothpastes  formulated with antimicrobial ingredients (stannous fluoride and triclosan/copolymer) on oral micro-organisms, including those found in samples taken from the human oral cavity. microbiological techniques determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of each dentifrice necessary to inhibit the growth of bacterial strains from the healthy oral cavity, as well as those found in dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis. ex vivo studies utilized oral rinse samples and supragingival plaque from adults to determine antimicrobial effects on the entire microbial diversity of these samples, including biofilm-derived micro-organisms. the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the lowest mics and significantly inhibited gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). in the ex vivo tests, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated substantial inhibition in the oral rinse samples over each treatment period (p > 0.0005) as compared to either the fluoride or stannous fluoride dentifrices. similarly, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the highest inhibition of micro-organisms in the supragingival plaque biofilm (p < 0.0005). no significant differences were observed between the fluoride and stannous fluoride dentifrices (p > 0.5).
efficacy of a low-concentration chlorhexidine mouth rinse in non-compliant periodontitis patients attending a supportive periodontal care programme: a randomized clinical trial.
objective: to assess the clinical and microbiological efficacy of a 0.05% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetyl-pyridinium chloride mouth rinse in supportive periodontal care (spc) in patients with inadequate plaque control. material and methods: the study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis under spc with an inadequate plaque control (turesky index >1). after supragingival prophylaxis and oral hygiene reinforcement, participants rinsed twice a day for 3 months with the test or placebo solutions, in addition to conventional hygiene. primary clinical outcome variables included plaque and gingival indices. as secondary outcomes, periodontal and microbiological variables were studied. ancova and chi(2) tests were used to compare the variables. results: forty-seven patients (22 placebo and 25 test group) participated. after 3 months, plaque levels increased in the placebo group, while diminished in the test group (p<0.001). similar effects were found for bleeding on probing. the other clinical parameters did not show significant differences. microbiological variables demonstrated inter-group significant reductions in subgingival counts of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia and a decrease of the total bacterial counts in saliva. conclusions: the tested mouth rinse demonstrated efficacy in reducing plaque and gingivitis, as well as in decreasing the microbial load in saliva and gingival sulcus.
fusobacterium nucleatum enhances invasion of human gingival epithelial and aortic endothelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
invasion by porphyromonas gingivalis has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. porphyromonas gingivalis have direct access to the systemic circulation and endothelium in periodontitis patients by transient bacteremia. periodontitis can be described as one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans. in the present study, p. gingivalis strains were tested for their ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell line (ca9-22) and human aortic endothelial cells in coinfection with fusobacterium nucleatum using antibiotic protection assays. coinfection with f. nucleatum resulted in 2-20-fold increase in the invasion of host cells by p. gingivalis strains. the invasive abilities of p. gingivalis strains were significantly greater when incubated with a f. nucleatum clinical isolate (which possesses strong biofilm-forming ability), than when incubated with a f. nucleatum-type strain. in inhibition assays with metabolic inhibitors, a difference in inhibition profiles was observed between mono- and polymicrobial infections. collectively, our results suggest that f. nucleatum facilitates invasion of host cells by p. gingivalis. investigations of polymicrobial infection of host cells should improve our understanding of the role of p. gingivalis in periodontal infection and proatherogenic mechanisms.
frequency, microbial interactions, and antimicrobial susceptibility of fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum isolated from primary endodontic infections.
this study assessed the prevalence and microbial interactions of fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum in primary endodontic infections from a brazilian population and their antimicrobial susceptibility to some antibiotics by the e-test. one hundred ten samples from infected teeth with periapical pathologies were analyzed by culture methods. five hundred eighty individual strains were isolated; 81.4% were strict anaerobes. f. nucleatum was found in 38 root canals and was associated with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., and eubacterium spp. f. necrophorum was found in 20 root canals and was associated with peptostreptococcus prevotii. the simultaneous presence of f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum was not related to endodontic symptoms (p > 0.05). they were 100% susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and cephaclor. fusobacterium spp. is frequently isolated from primary-infected root canals of teeth with periapical pathologies. amoxicillin is a useful antibiotic against f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum in endodontic infections and has been prescribed as the first choice in brazil.
effects of glass ionomer and microfilled composite subgingival restorations on periodontal tissue and subgingival biofilm: a 6-month evaluation.
background: this 6-month study evaluated the effects of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (rmgi) and microfilled composite (mc) subgingival restorations on periodontal tissues and subgingival biofilm. methods: fifty-four periodontally healthy patients were assigned as follows: group 1 (n = 18), root exposure (re) without non-carious cervical lesions (nccl) treated with coronally positioned flap (cpf); group 2 (n = 18), re with nccl treated rmgi restorations plus cpf; group 3 (n = 18), re with nccl treated with mc restorations plus cpf. probing depth (pd), visible local plaque score (pl), and local bleeding on probing (bop) were assessed at baseline and 6 months after surgeries. restored and non-restored root recoverage (rr) was assessed at 6 months. each experimental tooth was subgingivally sampled (baseline and 6 months) and analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: clinical results showed no significant differences among the groups regarding pl, bop, and pd at baseline and 6 months. the rr means were similar among the groups at 6 months. intragroup analyses revealed that the proportions of 10 periodontopathogens decreased at 6 months for the control group. for the rmgi group, there was a significant decrease in the proportions of nine periodontopathogens. for the mc group, there was a significant increase in the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum and gemella morbillorum and a decrease in five periodontopathogens. intergroup analyses showed an increase in the proportion of f. nucleatum polymorphum for the mc group. conclusions: in a 6-month evaluation, well-finished rmgi or mc subgingival restorations did not negatively affect periodontal health. furthermore, rmgi seems to exert more positive effects on the subgingival biofilm composition than mc.
antimicrobial actions of benzimidazoles against the oral anaerobes fusobacterium  nucleatum and prevotella intermedia.
background/objective: benzimidazoles are widely used as proton-pump inhibitors to control stomach hyperacidity and have been found also to have antimicrobial actions against helicobacter pylori and oral streptococci. our primary aim was to determine if they are active also against oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis. our major focus was on catabolism because it leads to production of inflammatory metabolites such as butyrate and ammonia. the benzimidazoles are effective in the protonated form at acid ph values and cause irreversible inhibition of enzymes associated with formation of drug-target disulfide bonds. methods: fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586 and prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 were grown anaerobically in suspension cultures, harvested, washed and exposed to the benzimidazole lansoprazole at ph values of 4 or 5 before being washed and used for standard assays to detect inhibition of catabolic functions, uptake of the agent and lethality. results: lansoprazole was found to be a bacteriostatic, multi-target antimicrobial against f. nucleatum under anaerobic conditions inhibitory for amino acid fermentation and also for glycolysis of glucose or fructose. id(50) values for fermentation of amino acids and dipeptides by f. nucleatum ranged from 0.05 mm for lysine to 0.25 mm for serine. fructose catabolism was highly sensitive with an id(50) value of 0.03 mm apparently related to high sensitivity of the phosphoenolpyruvate:fructose phosphotransferase system, while the id(50) for glucose catabolism by intact cells was some 0.07 mm. fermentation of aspartate or aspartylaspartate by p. intermedia was found to be lansoprazole-sensitive with id(50) values of about 0.18 and 0.20 mm, respectively. conclusion: catabolism of amino acids, dipeptides and sugars by oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis are sensitive to the inhibitory actions of lansoprazole. thus, catabolic pathways are potential targets for use of benzimidazoles against bacteria involved in gingivitis.
coaggregation of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum pk 1594 is  mediated by capsular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide.
previous reports have shown that coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, two important periodontopathogens, is mediated by a galactoside on the surface of p. gingivalis and a lectin on f. nucleatum. in the present study, purified capsular polysaccharide (cps) and lipopolysaccharide (lps) of p. gingivalis pk 1924 (serotype k5) were found to be able to bind to f. nucleatum cells and to inhibit binding of f. nucleatum to p. gingivalis serotype k5. sugar binding studies showed that the requirements for binding of p. gingivalis serotype k5 cps and lps to the f. nucleatum lectin are: the presence of a metal divalent ion, an axial free hydroxyl group at position 4 and free equatorial hydroxyl groups at position 3 and 6 of d-galactose. these data suggest that p. gingivalis serotype k5- cps and lps act as receptors mediating coaggregation between p. gingivalis and fusobacteria.
inhibitory effect of weissella cibaria isolates on the production of volatile sulphur compounds.
aims: the objective of this study was to characterize the inhibitory effects of weissella cibaria isolates on volatile sulphur compounds (vsc) production both in vitro and in vivo. material and methods: we isolated and identified three hydrogen peroxide-generating lactobacilli from children's saliva, and assessed their inhibitory effects on vsc production and fusobacterium nucleatum proliferation. clinical studies were conducted with 46 subjects in order to measure the vsc of their mouth air. results: these lactobacilli were identified as w. cibaria. these isolates inhibited the production of vsc by f. nucleatum (p<0.05). the concentration of f. nucleatum was decreased by 5-log cycles as a result of exposure to the w. cibaria strains (p<0.05), whereas the catalase-treated w. cibaria cultures exerted no evident inhibitory effects on f. nucleatum replication. in the clinical studies, gargling with one isolate resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of h2s and ch3sh by approximately 48.2% (p<0.01) and 59.4% (p<0.05), respectively. conclusions: these results indicate that w. cibaria isolates possess the ability to inhibit vsc production under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, demonstrating that they bear the potential for development into novel probiotics for use in the oral cavity.
multi-target antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes.
objective: zinc is used in oral care products as an antiplaque/antigingivitis agent. our objective was to assess the antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis, specifically fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, with focus on catabolism and oxidative metabolism. methods: the oral anaerobes were grown in complex medium in an anaerobic chamber, harvested by centrifugation and used directly for experiments with suspensions. biofilm growth involved super-infection by f. nucleatum of an initial biofilm formed by streptococcus sanguis. results: zn(2+) inhibited catabolism of glutamate, glutamyl-glutamate, glucose and fructose by f. nucleatum cells in suspensions with id(50) values, respectively, of 0.05, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.01 mm. the id(50) value for inhibition of glutamate catabolism by biofilms was 0.10 mm. inhibition of glutamate catabolism could be related to inhibition of substrate uptake and of 2-oxoglutarate reductase. zn(2+) also inhibited catabolism of aspartate or aspartyl-aspartate by p. intermedia with id(50) values of 0.07 and about 0.03 mm, respectively. respiration of intact cells of f. nucleatum and nadh oxidase in cell extracts were sensitive to zinc with id(50) values, respectively, of about 1.0 and 1.4 mm. zinc also inhibited production of hydrogen peroxide by f. nucleatum (id(50) = ca. 0.04 mm.) but at high concentrations acted to potentiate and enhance peroxide killing of the anaerobe. conclusion: zn(2+) is a potent inhibitor of catabolism by f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, including catabolism of peptides, which can be degraded to yield inflammatory metabolic end products. zn(2+) also inhibits o(2) metabolism of f. nucleatum by about 50% and hydrogen peroxide production nearly completely but also enhances killing by peroxide added to cells.
antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia with oral lactobacilli.
microbiota residing in oral ecosystems show great complexity because of the mutual interdependence of certain microorganisms that might influence their presence or absence at a given site. the aim of this work was to evaluate possible antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, isolated from periodontal pockets, and lactobacillus casei, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus and l. plantarum isolated from saliva. different tests were carried out using each strain as an effector as well as a sensitive strain, alternatively: (1) agar diffusion with paper disks embedded with supernatants and pellets in different culture media; (b) the well diffusion assay; (c) the double layer method; and (d) od(560) measurements of the kinetic growth of lactobacillus strains in laptg broth with different volumes of f. nucleatum supernatant. p. intermedia supernatant did not have an inhibitory effect on lactobacillus growth, except for l. casei, when the double plaque method was used. f. nucleatum supernatant inhibited growth of all lactobacillus strains when the well diffusion method was used. f. nucleatum inhibited l. casei growth whatever the method used. the substance responsible for inhibition was a thermoresistant extracellular protein which was hydrolyzed by trypsin-like proteases. none of the species of lactobacilli studied inhibited the growth of p. intermedia or f. nucleatum.
additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
it is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to ca(oh)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. the objective of this study was to identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. ca(oh)2 was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. efficacy of killing was compared for (a) ca(oh)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (zno) points alone; (c) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno points; (d) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno/chlorhexidine points; and (e) ca(oh)2 points combined with zno/chlorhexidine points. common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. in the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by ca(oh)2 alone. combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. for the inactivation of the gram-positive bacteria p. micros and s. intermedius, a combination of ca(oh)2 and zno/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria faster than ca(oh)2 alone. for e. faecalis, combining ca(oh)2 suspension with zno/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. the results of this study support the use of a combination of ca(oh)2 and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of p. micros and s. intermedius from infected root canals.
3-chloro-dl-alanine resistance by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.
effect of fusobacterium nucleatum on the t and b cell responses to porphyromonas  gingivalis in a mouse model.
t cell cytokine profiles and specific serum antibody levels in five groups of balb/c mice immunized with saline alone, viable fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, viable porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis and p. gingivalis followed by f. nucleatum were determined. splenic cd4 and cd8 cells were examined for intracytoplasmic interleukin (il)-4, interferon (ifn)-gamma and il-10 by dual colour flow cytometry and the levels of serum anti-f. nucleatum and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies determined by an elisa. both th1 and th2 responses were demonstrated by all groups, and while there were slightly lower percentages of cytokine positive t cells in mice injected with f. nucleatum alone compared with the other groups immunized with bacteria, f. nucleatum had no effect on the t cell production of cytokines induced by p. gingivalis in the two groups immunized with both organisms. however, the percentages of cytokine positive cd8 cells were generally significantly higher than those of the cd4 cells. mice immunized with f. nucleatum alone had high levels of serum anti-f. nucleatum antibodies with very low levels of p. gingivalis antibodies, whereas mice injected with p. gingivalis alone produced anti-p. gingivalis antibodies predominantly. although the levels of anti-f. nucleatum antibodies in mice injected with f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis were the same as in mice immunized with f. nucleatum alone, antibody levels to p. gingivalis were very low. in contrast, mice injected with p. gingivalis followed by f. nucleatum produced equal levels of both anti-p. gingivalis and anti-f. nucleatum antibodies, although at lower levels than the other three groups immunized with bacteria, respectively. anti-actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and prevotella intermedia serum antibody levels were also determined and found to be negligible. in conclusion, f. nucleatum immunization does not affect the splenic t cell cytokine response to p. gingivalis. however, f. nucleatum immunization prior to that of p. gingivalis almost completely inhibited the production of anti-p. gingivalis antibodies while p. gingivalis injection before f. nucleatum demonstrated a partial inhibitory effect by p. gingivalis on antibody production to f. nucleatum. the significance of these results with respect to human periodontal disease is difficult to determine. however, they may explain in part differing responses to p. gingivalis in different individuals who may or may not have had prior exposure to f. nucleatum. finally, the results suggested that p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum do not induce the production of cross-reactive antibodies to other oral microorganisms.
antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on periodontal bacteria.
the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (no) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. the aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through no production, on the periodontal disease pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. whereas the growth of these organisms was inhibited by a more acid ph, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after exposure. the ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also affected by ph and nitrite concentration. at acidity levels below ph 5.0, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mm) caused effective complete killing of the periodontal bacteria. addition of sodium thiocyanate did not increase the bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal activity of acidified nitrite against any of the 3 bacteria. these results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva, under appropriate conditions, may have an effect on the growth and survival of the bacteria implicated in periodontal disease.
interleukin-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 regulation in oral epithelial cells by selected periodontal bacteria: multiple effects of porphyromonas gingivalis via antagonistic mechanisms.
interaction of bacteria with mucosal surfaces can modulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules produced by epithelial cells. previously, we showed that expression of interleukin-8 (il-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) by gingival epithelial cells increases following interaction with several putative periodontal pathogens. in contrast, expression of il-8 and icam-1 is reduced after porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 challenge. in the present study, we investigated the mechanisms that govern the regulation of these two molecules in bacterially infected gingival epithelial cells. experimental approaches included bacterial stimulation of gingival epithelial cells by either a brief challenge (1.5 to 2 h) or a continuous coculture throughout the incubation period. the kinetics of il-8 and icam-1 expression following brief challenge were such that (i) secretion of il-8 by gingival epithelial cells reached its peak 2 h following fusobacterium nucleatum infection whereas it rapidly decreased within 2 h after p. gingivalis infection and remained decreased up to 30 h and (ii) il-8 and icam-1 mrna levels were up-regulated rapidly 2 to 4 h postinfection and then decreased to basal levels 8 to 20 h after infection with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, or p. gingivalis. attenuation of il-8 secretion was facilitated by adherent p. gingivalis strains. the il-8 secreted from epithelial cells after f. nucleatum stimulation could be down-regulated by subsequent infection with p. gingivalis or its culture supernatant. although these results suggested that il-8 attenuation at the protein level might be associated with p. gingivalis proteases, the arg- and lys-gingipain proteases did not appear to be solely responsible for il-8 attenuation. in addition, while p. gingivalis up-regulated il-8 mrna expression, this effect was overridden when the bacteria were continuously cocultured with the epithelial cells. the il-8 mrna levels in epithelial cells following sequential challenge with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum and vice versa were approximately identical and were lower than those following f. nucleatum challenge alone and higher than control levels or those following p. gingivalis challenge alone. thus, together with the protease effect, p. gingivalis possesses a powerful strategy to ensure the down-regulation of il-8 and icam-1.
inducible expression of human beta-defensin 2 by fusobacterium nucleatum in oral  epithelial cells: multiple signaling pathways and role of commensal bacteria in innate immunity and the epithelial barrier.
human gingival epithelial cells (hge) express two antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family, human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) and hbd-2, as well as cytokines and chemokines that contribute to innate immunity. in the present study, the expression and transcriptional regulation of hbd-2 was examined. hbd-2 mrna was induced by cell wall extract of fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal microorganism, but not by that of porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen. hbd-2 mrna was also induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and phorbol myristate acetate (pma), an epithelial cell activator. hbd-2 mrna was also expressed in 14 of 15 noninflamed gingival tissue samples. hbd-2 peptide was detected by immunofluorescence in hge stimulated with f. nucleatum cell wall, consistent with induction of the mrna by this stimulant. kinetic analysis indicates involvement of multiple distinct signaling pathways in the regulation of hbd-2 mrna; tnf-alpha and f. nucleatum cell wall induced hbd-2 mrna rapidly (2 to 4 h), while pma stimulation was slower ( approximately 10 h). in contrast, each stimulant induced interleukin 8 (il-8) within 1 h. the role of tnf-alpha as an intermediary in f. nucleatum signaling was ruled out by addition of anti-tnf-alpha that did not inhibit hbd-2 induction. however, inhibitor studies show that f. nucleatum stimulation of hbd-2 mrna requires both new gene transcription and new protein synthesis. bacterial lipopolysaccharides isolated from escherichia coli and f. nucleatum were poor stimulants of hbd-2, although they up-regulated il-8 mrna. collectively, our findings show inducible expression of hbd-2 mrna via multiple pathways in hge in a pattern that is distinct from that of il-8 expression. we suggest that different aspects of innate immune responses are differentially regulated and that commensal organisms have a role in stimulating mucosal epithelial cells in maintaining the barrier that contributes to homeostasis and host defense.
microbiological response of localized sites with recurrent periodontitis in maintenance patients treated with tetracycline fibers.
background: whether adjunctive tetracycline fibers can provide an additive effect to scaling and root planing in treating non-responsive sites in maintenance subjects is still controversial. recolonization of the bacteria from untreated sites or from the extracrevicular region may explain the insignificant response to local therapy. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbiological response of sites treated with tetracycline fibers combined with scaling and root planing. methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. thirty patients on maintenance therapy having at least 2 non-adjacent sites in separate quadrants with probing depths between 4 to 8 mm with bleeding on probing, or aspartate aminotransferase enzyme levels > 800 microiu in the gingival crevicular fluid, were treated with scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibers or with scaling and root planing only. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment. a. actino-mycetemcomitans, c. rectus, b. forsythus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia were detected by culture, immunofluorescence, or pcr technique. results: there was a reduction of total bacterial cell count, as well as of certain periodontal pathogens, following treatment. the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis and the mean proportions of c. rectus, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and p. gingivalis decreased after therapy, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to bacterial proportions or the number of positive sites. besides, the pathogens could not be eliminated from the periodontal pocket, and recolonization of the pocket was noted at 3 months post-treatment. conclusions: bacteria located within the cheek, tongue mucosa, saliva, or untreated sites may contribute to reinfection of the pockets and explain the insignificant response to local tetracycline therapy.
induction of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
we examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte autoantibody (ata) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral escherichia coli. all of the lps induced igm-ata. among these, lps from c. ochracea induced the highest level of igm-ata, whereas that of p. gingivalis induced the lowest. the peritoneal t lymphocytes of mice injected with lps were bound by igm-ata. peritoneal b-1 (cd5+b) cells stimulated by each lps produced much more igm-ata than splenic b-2 (cd5-b) cells, suggesting that b-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. serum of mice injected with c. ochracea and f. nucleatum lps showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by igm purified from serum of the mice injected with c. ochracea lps. furthermore, serum of mice treated with c. ochracea, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans lps inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. however, purified igm from the serum of mice treated with c. ochracea lps failed to produce the same inhibition. our results suggest that lps from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce igm-ata in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.
cytotoxic effect of endodontic bacteria on periapical fibroblasts.
this study was conducted to investigate the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (sbes) from anaerobic gram-negative bacteria on periapical fibroblast obtained from the apical portion of human periodontal ligaments. porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were chosen from among the endodontic bacteria isolated from root canals having a periapical lesion and compared in terms of their cytotoxicity. the purpose of this study was to examine which bacteria are involved in the development of periapical inflammation. the anaerobes were cultured under strict anaerobic conditions, and the bacterial cells were then harvested by centrifugation after incubation. the concentrated cell suspensions were sonicated and subsequently centrifuged. an sbe was made of each of the filtered supernatants. each sbe was added to cultures of periapical fibroblasts. the cell growth and proliferation were measured by the mtt method after 3, 5, and 7 days. the sbes from p. endodontalis, p. gingivalis, and f. nucleatum inhibited the growth of the fibroblasts, whereas the sbe from p. intermedia did not inhibit it. the sbes from p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum inhibited the fibroblast growth more strongly than did the p. endodontalis, p. gingivalis, and f. nucleatum may participate in the development of periapical lesions.
acid tolerance and acid-neutralizing activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum.
the tolerance to acid and the acid-neutralizing activity of three important periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum were studied. p. gingivalis strains grew only at neutral ph and did not utilize glucose, whereas strains of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum could grow under acidic conditions and increased their growth by utilizing glucose. p. gingivalis tended to raise the culture ph during growth. p. intermedia and f. nucleatum raised the culture ph during growth in the absence of glucose, while in the presence of glucose they decreased the ph. resting cell suspensions of all the bacteria raised the ph in the presence of tryptone and casamino acids. acid-neutralizing activity was confirmed by measuring base production at a fixed ph with a ph-stat. during neutralization, the cells produced cytotoxic substrates, ammonia and organic acids (butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acids by p. gingivalis; isovaleric and succinic acids by p. intermedia; propionic and butyric acids by f. nucleatum). these findings suggest that deamination of amino acids into ammonia and organic acids occurs simultaneously with base production, resulting in acid neutralization. these results could partially explain the survival of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in both supragingival and subgingival plaque and the apparent restriction of p. gingivalis to subgingival plaque. the former bacteria may aid in creation of an environment fostering colonization of subgingival plaque by p. gingivalis.
inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.
funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata, strongly inhibited the adsorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) used as an experimental pellicle and strongly desorbed cariogenic mutans streptococci pre-adsorbed to s-ha. colonization inhibition and anticariogenic effects of funoran were also investigated in experimental rats. the colonization of streptococcus cricetus e49 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats administered funoran was less frequent than that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group. the inhibitory effect of funoran on periodontopathic bacterial attachment was studied in vitro. funoran strongly inhibited the adsorption of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces species to s-ha and collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (co-ha) and apparently inhibited their attachment to the human gingival fibroblast gin-1 cell line. the present study indicates that funoran inhibits colonization by cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria and excludes them from human oral cavity.
cellular adhesion molecules on periodontal lymphocytes.
t cell induced differentiation of b cells has been shown to be dependent on the cd2/lfa-3 and lfa-1/icam-1 pathways. flow cytometric analysis was used to examine these adhesion molecules on t and b cells extracted from gingival tissues before and after stimulation with the putative periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. adhesion molecule expression on peripheral blood cells from healthy adults was used as a control. approximately 50 per cent of b cells extracted from gingival tissues expressed lfa-3 and icam-1 compared with 30 per cent positive peripheral blood b cells. around 50 per cent of gingival t cells expressed cd2 relative to 76 per cent positive peripheral blood t cells. however, 40-50 per cent of both gingival and peripheral blood t cells expressed lfa-1. there was no difference in the expression of adhesion molecules on t and b cells extracted from health/marginal gingivitis or adult periodontitis lesions. after stimulation of gingival cells in vitro, the per cent cd2 positive t cells and lfa-3 and icam-1 positive b cells remained relatively stable over the six-day culture period, although p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum appeared to induce an increase in the percentage of gingival t cells expressing lfa-1. in contrast to the gingival lymphocytes, stimulation of peripheral blood cells resulted in an increase in the per cent cd2 positive t cells, lfa-3 and icam-1 positive b cells, with a decrease in lfa-1 positive t cells. the results therefore demonstrated that gingival t and b cells express adhesion molecules in vivo.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (lps). the effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the dna content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. lps samples were purified from porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and escherichia coli 0111:b4 lps was used as a positive control. at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the lpss caused any change in the production of dna or protein, whereas the amount of dna was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. protein synthesis was decreased by lpss at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of lps tested.
phenotypic analysis of b-cells extracted from human periodontal disease tissue.
b-cells extracted from periodontal disease tissue were analyzed for the presence  of activation markers using a range of monoclonal antibodies. in adult periodontitis (ap), 6% of b-cells expressed the il-2 receptor (cd25) compared with 1-2% in peripheral blood and healthy or marginal gingivitis (h/mg) gingival b-cells. there was also an increase in the mean percentage of igd-positive b-cells and a decrease in cd21 and cd22 expression. in both ap and h/mg lesions, 20-22% of the b-cells expressed cd23 compared with less than 5% in peripheral blood. as b-cells are activated by day 3 in culture and start differentiating into immunoglobulin-secreting cells by day 6, b-cell phenotypes were assayed at these times in this study. following stimulation with the periodontopathic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis, the expression of cd23, cd21 and cd22 on b-cells extracted from ap lesions remained relatively constant over the 6-d culture period. however, with fusobacterium nucleatum stimulation, there was a significant decrease in cd23, cd21 and cd22 expression after 3 d in culture, which corresponds to the activation time for b-cells. these results show that b-cells extracted from periodontal disease tissue display a range of activation markers and on stimulation, demonstrate differing responses to individual periodontopathic bacteria.
inhibition of coaggregation between fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis by lactose and related sugars.
the coaggregation of fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 and porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis pk1924 was inhibited equally well by lactose, n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, and d-galactose, which caused 50% inhibition of coaggregation at 2 mm sugar concentration. other sugars such as d-galactosamine, d-fucose (6-deoxy-d-galactose), and alpha-methyl- and beta-methyl-d-galactosides also inhibited coaggregation. sugar specificity was apparent, since neither l-fucose, l-rhamnose, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, nor n-acetylneuraminic acid was an inhibitor. protease treatment of the fusobacterium completely abolished coaggregation, whereas it had no effect on the coaggregating activity of the porphyromonad. although numerous lactose-inhibitable coaggregating pairs are known to occur among gram-positive bacteria, this report and the accompanying survey (p. e. kolenbrander, r. n. andersen, and l. v. h. moore, infect. immun. 57:3194-3203, 1989) are the first studies demonstrating the extensive nature of this type of interaction between gram-negative human oral bacteria. the significance of galactoside-inhibitable coaggregations between these two potential periodontal pathogens is discussed.
the effect of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents on three bacterial mixtures.
a test tube technique was developed to screen bacterial mixtures to detect interbacterial interactions that play a role in determining sensitivity to antimicrobial agents. we found 3 mixtures where these bacterial interactions change the sensitivity to antimicrobials or change the proportions of each bacterial species in the mixture. the mixtures were: fusobacterium nucleatum 102.3 and bacteroides endodontalis atcc 35406; f. nucleatum 102.3 and b. endodontalis bn11 a-f; and capnocytophaga ochracea 1956c and eubacterium saburreum 162.4. the antimicrobials used were metronidazole for the first 2 mixtures and tetracycline for the last. f. nucleatum seems to protect b. endodontalis from the action of metronidazole. conversely, the growth inhibition of c. ochracea by e. saburreum was lifted when tetracycline was present. we also found that the growth of c. ochracea can then permit the subsequent growth of e. saburreum. the test tube method permits the evaluation both of interbacterial interactions and the detection of any protective mechanism against antimicrobial agents in a bacterial mixture. we found that f. nucleatum 102.3 can decrease the metronidazole level in the culture medium, and by the use of 14c-metronidazole we demonstrated that acetamide is produced from metronidazole.
