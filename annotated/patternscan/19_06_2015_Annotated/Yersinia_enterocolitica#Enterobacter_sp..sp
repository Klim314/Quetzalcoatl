TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == effect of neem extract against the bacteria isolated from marine fish.
AB  == marine ornamental fishes are exceedingly valuable due to their high demand in domestic and international markets. there is a growing global interest to rear the fishes in captivity. but problem due to bacteria and fungi are the major hitch in captive condition. since, the use of antibiotics is banned, an attempt was made to ascertain in vitro assay of the neem leaves extract against the bacterial pathogens isolated from infected fishes. bacterial strains isolated from infected regions of the clown fishes amphiprion sebae and a. ocellaris were  identified as aeromonas hydrophila, enterobacter sp., e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp., streptococcus sp., vibrio cholerae, v. alginolyticus, v. parahaemolyticus and yersinia enterocolitica. ethanol and methanol extracts were  highly inhibitory to the bacterial isolates when compared to other solvents. ethanol extracts exhibited low minimum inhibitory concentration (75-250 microg ml(-1)) as compared to other extracts. the present finding revealed that the neem leaf extract significantly reduces the bacterial pathogens and their infection in marine ornamental fishes.

TI  == extracellular accumulation of bioactive substances; interleukin-1beta (il-1beta)  and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) in stored blood units and relation  to bacterial contamination.
AB  == bacterial contamination of blood and its cellular components remains an unresolved problem in transfusion medicine and is considered to be the most common microbiological cause of transfusion associated morbidity and mortality. the present work was designed to explore the levels of two bioactive compounds interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) in stored blood units and their relation to bacterial contamination of these units.  this study was conducted on 112 blood units obtained from blood bank of mansoura  university children hospital. sequential blood samples were obtained both immediately at donation and after 10 days for measurement of il-1beta and pai-1 and for bacterial culture by bactec 9050 system. there was statistically significant increase in both il-1 beta and pai-1 (p = 0.0001) after 10 days of blood units storage. bacteriological culture revealed no growth in 68% and positive growth in 32% of blood units. the commonest isolated organism was staphylococcus aureus (15%) followed by staphylococcus epidermedis (13%) then yersinia sp. and enterobacter sp. (2%) for each. from the present study we could  conclude that stored blood units contain platelets and wbcs derived bioactive substances pai-1 and il-1beta which increase with the duration of blood storage.  furthermore, the extended duration of storage carries the danger of blood contamination by bacteria. automated blood culture system seems to be helpful in  identification of bacterial contamination of blood units. we recommend fresh blood transfusion as early as possible and the practice of leucofiltration to avoid blood transfusion complications.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == variability of peptidoglycan structural parameters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == muropeptide composition of peptidoglycan from the gram-negative bacteria aeromonas sp., acinetobacter acetoaceticus, agrobacterium tumefaciens, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, vibrio parahaemolyticus yersinia enterocolitica and escherichia coli, was analyzed by hplc. in all instances peptidoglycan was built up from the same subunits. a wide disparity in the relative abundance of muropeptides and all structural parameters was observed. the contribution of ld-a2pm-a2pm cross-linked muropeptides was extremely variable; from 1 to 45% of cross-linked muropeptides.  muropeptides with the dipeptides lys-lys or arg-lys, indicative of murein-bound (lipo)proteins, were detected in all instances although abundance was very variable.

TI  == evaluation of rapid one system for identification of 379 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  == the ability of the rapid one system (innovative diagnostic systems, inc., norcross, ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. kits were inoculated with no. 2 mcfarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c. overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas  and non-shigella sonnei shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional  tests. for four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included  one serratia liquefaciens (serratia marcescens or serratia liquefaciens), one serratia rubidaea (serratia rubidaea or serratia odorifera), one salmonella typhi (leminorella richardii or salmonella sp.) and one yersinia enterocolitica (yersinia frederiksenii, yersinia intermedia, or yersinia enterocolitica). twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these  comprised one citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three enterobacter hormaechei (not in the rapid one database; two enterobacter amnigenus, one enterobacter sp.), one serratia liquefaciens (enterobacter cloacae), one serratia rubidaea (no identification), four serratia fonticola (not in rapid one database; two enterobacter aerogenes, one serratia marcescens, one not identified), one proteus mirabilis (proteus penneri), and one proteus vulgaris (providencia rustigianii). if the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. the rapid one system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.

TI  == visual identification of bacterially contaminated red cells.
AB  == there have been increasing numbers of reports of transfusion-acquired yersinia enterocolitica bacteremia (including several fatal cases). fifteen units of whole blood were inoculated with various concentrations of y. enterocolitica serotype 0:3 and processed into as-3 preserved red cells (rbcs). consistent growth of the  organism was found at inoculum concentrations greater than or equal to 10 colony-forming units per ml. in all 13 units of rbcs that supported the growth of y. enterocolitica, a darkening in color (due to hemolysis and a decrease in po2)  was observed in the bag. the attached sample segments, which were sealed from the main unit, remained sterile and did not darken. this color change was apparent in all the contaminated units by day 35, which was 1.5 to 2 weeks after the bacteria were first detected in cultures of the blood. hence, by comparison of the color of the segment tubing with that of the unit itself, units grossly contaminated with y. enterocolitica can be identified prior to transfusion. moreover, review of photographs on file at the centers for disease control revealed this dramatic  color change in 2 units of blood that caused transfusion-transmitted sepsis (enterobacter agglomerans and an unidentified gram-negative bacillus, not yersinia sp.), which demonstrated that the color change was not limited to y. enterocolitica. this method of visual identification of contaminated units of blood could decrease the incidence of posttransfusion bacterial sepsis.

TI  == hemolysin as a marker for serratia.
AB  == all serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. dna fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal dna of s. marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. kiliensis, s. grimesii, s. proteamaculans, s. plymutica, s. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. the restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. s. ficaria and s. marinorubra expressed  a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the s. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. the dna of the latter strains did not hybridize with the s. marcescens hemolysin dna probes. some s. marcescens strains, s. kiliensis and s. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. no hybridization was found with dna of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella arerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosus, listeria sp.,  aeromonas sp., legionella sp. and a meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin dna probes are specific for serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than serratia.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l.  pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than  or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant  to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.

TI  == [effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  == bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains,  the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, streptococcus sanguis, s. saprophyticus, s. faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus flavus, actinomyces viscosus, veillonella sp., enterobacter liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica. lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. proteus vulgaris, y. enterocolitica and chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. the yeasts endomyces lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula mucilaginosa and cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. the kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did  not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
