TI  - Strategies for the production of difficult-to-express full-length eukaryotic proteins using microbial cell factories: production of human alpha-galactosidase A.
AB  - Obtaining high levels of pure proteins remains the main bottleneck of many scientific and biotechnological studies. Among all the available recombinant expression systems, Escherichia coli facilitates gene expression by its relative simplicity, inexpensive and fast cultivation, well-known genetics and the large number of tools available for its biotechnological application. However, recombinant expression in E. coli is not always a straightforward procedure and major obstacles are encountered when producing many eukaryotic proteins and especially membrane proteins, linked to missing posttranslational modifications, proteolysis and aggregation. In this context, many conventional and unconventional eukaryotic hosts are under exploration and development, but in some cases linked to complex culture media or processes. In this context, alternative bacterial systems able to overcome some of the limitations posed by E. coli keeping the simplicity of prokaryotic manipulation are currently emerging as convenient hosts for protein production. We have comparatively produced a "difficult-to-express" human protein, the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (hGLA) in E. coli and in the psychrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 cells (P. haloplanktis TAC125). While in E. coli the production of active hGLA was unreachable due to proteolytic instability and/or protein misfolding, the expression of hGLA gene in P. haloplanktis TAC125 allows obtaining active enzyme. These results are discussed in the context of emerging bacterial systems for protein production that represent appealing alternatives to the regular use of E. coli and also of more complex eukaryotic systems.
TI  - Functional adaptations of the bacterial chaperone trigger factor to extreme environmental temperatures.
AB  - Trigger factor (TF) is the first molecular chaperone interacting cotranslationally with virtually all nascent polypeptides synthesized by the ribosome in bacteria. Thermal adaptation of chaperone function was investigated in TFs from the Antarctic psychrophile Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, the mesophile Escherichia coli and the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima. This series covers nearly all temperatures encountered by bacteria. Although structurally homologous, these TFs display strikingly distinct properties that are related to the bacterial environmental temperature. The hyperthermophilic TF strongly binds model proteins during their folding and protects them from heat-induced misfolding and aggregation. It decreases the folding rate and counteracts the fast folding rate imposed by high temperature. It also functions as a carrier of partially folded proteins for delivery to downstream chaperones ensuring final maturation. By contrast, the psychrophilic TF displays weak chaperone activities, showing that these functions are less important in cold conditions because protein folding, misfolding and aggregation are slowed down at low temperature. It efficiently catalyses prolyl isomerization at low temperature as a result of its increased cellular concentration rather than from an improved activity. Some chaperone properties of the mesophilic TF possibly reflect its function as a cold shock protein in E. coli.
TI  - Discovery of a novel iota carrageenan sulfatase isolated from the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora.
AB  - Carrageenans are sulfated polysaccharides extracted from the cell wall of some marine red algae. These polysaccharides are widely used as gelling, stabilizing, and viscosifying agents in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Since the rheological properties of these polysaccharides depend on their sulfate content, we screened several isolated marine bacteria for carrageenan specific sulfatase activity, in the aim of developing enzymatic bioconversion of carrageenans. As a result of the screening, an iota-carrageenan sulfatase was detected in the cell-free lysate of the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora strain Psc(T). It was purified through Phenyl Sepharose and Diethylaminoethyl Sepharose chromatography. The pure enzyme, Psc iota-CgsA, was characterized. It had a molecular weight of 115.9 kDaltons and exhibited an optimal activity/stability at pH ~8.3 and at 40 +/- 5 degrees C. It was inactivated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride but not by ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid. Psc iota-CgsA specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 4-S sulfate of iota-carrageenan. The purified enzyme could transform iota-carrageenan into hybrid iota-/alpha- or pure alpha-carrageenan under controlled conditions. The gene encoding Psc iota-CgsA, a protein of 1038 amino acids, was cloned into Escherichia coli, and the sequence analysis revealed that Psc iota-CgsA has more than 90% sequence identity with a putative uncharacterized protein Q3IKL4 from the marine strain Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125, but besides this did not share any homology to characterized sulfatases. Phylogenetic studies show that P. carrageenovora sulfatase thus represents the first characterized member of a new sulfatase family, with a C-terminal domain having strong similarity with the superfamily of amidohydrolases, highlighting the still unexplored diversity of marine polysaccharide modifying enzymes.
TI  - Recombinant production of a single-chain antibody fragment in Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125.
AB  - Recombinant protein production in cold-adapted bacteria has proved to be a valuable option to overcome solubility concerns often came up in conventional expression hosts. ScFvs are examples of "difficult proteins" due to their tendency to form inclusion bodies when expressed in Escherichia coli. In this paper, the recombinant production of a single-chain antibody (ScFvOx) in the psychrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 is reported. The expression vector for the ScFvOx production was designed to address the recombinant protein in the periplasmic space and to allow the formation of the antibody disulphide bonds. For periplasmic export, two different export mechanisms were evaluated. By combining the genetic tools available for recombinant protein expression in psychrophilic hosts with an ad hoc medium and fermentation modality and optimised expression conditions at low temperatures, we obtained the highest yield of soluble and epitope-binding ScFvOx reported so far by conventional prokaryotic expression. The observed proficiency of the Antarctic bacterium to produce recombinant antibody fragments was related to the unusually high number of genes encoding peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases found in P. haloplanktis TAC125 genome, making this bacterium the host of choice for the recombinant production of this protein class.
TI  - Identification and characterization of single-stranded DNA-binding protein from the facultative psychrophilic bacteria Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis.
AB  - Single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) plays an important role in DNA metabolism such as DNA replication, repair, and recombination, and is essential for cell survival. This study reports on the ssb-like gene cloning, gene expression and characterization of a single-stranded DNA-binding protein of Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (PhaSSB) and is the first report of such a protein from psychrophilic microorganism. PhaSSB possesses a high sequence similarity to Escherichia coli SSB (48% identity and 57% similarity) and has the longest amino acid sequence (244 amino acid residues) of all the known bacterial SSBs with one OB-fold per monomer. An analysis of purified PhaSSB by means of chemical cross-linking experiments, sedimentation analysis and size exclusion chromatography revealed a stable tetramer in solution. Using EMSA, we characterized the stoichiometry of PhaSSB complexed with a series of ssDNA homopolymers, and the size of the binding site was determined as being approximately 35 nucleotides long. In fluorescence titrations, the occluded site size of PhaSSB on poly(dT) is 34 nucleotides per tetramer under low-salt conditions (2mM NaCl), but increases to 54-64 nucleotides at higher-salt conditions (100-300mM NaCl). This suggests that PhaSSB undergoes a transition between ssDNA binding modes, which is observed for EcoSSB. The binding properties of PhaSSB investigated using SPR technology revealed that the affinity of PhaSSB to ssDNA is typical of SSB proteins. The only difference in the binding mode of PhaSSB to ssDNA is a faster association phase, when compared to EcoSSB, though compensated by faster dissociation rate. When analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the melting temperature (Tm) was determined as 63 degrees C, which is only a few degrees lower than for EcoSSB.
TI  - Energetics of protein stability at extreme environmental temperatures in bacterial trigger factors.
AB  - Trigger factor is the first molecular chaperone interacting cotranslationally with virtually all nascent polypeptides synthesized by the ribosome in bacteria. The stability of this primary folding assistant was investigated using trigger factors from the Antarctic psychrophile Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, the mesophile Escherichia coli, and the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima. This series covers nearly all temperatures encountered by living organisms. We show that proteins adapt their stability over the whole range of biological temperatures via adjustments of the same fundamental mechanisms, involving increases in enthalpic stabilization and decreases in unfolding rates, in parallel with the environmental temperature. Enthalpic stabilization in trigger factors is characterized by large increases in the melting temperature, T(m), ranging from 33 to 96.6 degrees C, associated with similarly large increases in unfolding enthalpy as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry. Stopped-flow spectroscopy shows that the folding rate constants for the three investigated proteins are similar, whereas the unfolding rate constants differ by several orders of magnitude, revealing that kinetic resistance to unfolding drives adjustments of protein stability. While the unusual stability of hyperthermophilic proteins has attracted much attention, this study indicates that they are an extreme case of a more general continuum, the other extreme being represented by natively unstable proteins from psychrophiles.
TI  - Antarctic bacterial haemoglobin and its role in the protection against nitrogen reactive species.
AB  - In a cold and oxygen-rich environment such as Antarctica, mechanisms for the defence against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are needed and represent important components in the evolutionary adaptations. In the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125, the presence of multiple genes encoding 2/2 haemoglobins and a flavohaemoglobin strongly suggests that these proteins fulfil important physiological roles, perhaps associated to the peculiar features of the Antarctic habitat. In this work, the putative role of Ph-2/2HbO, encoded by the PSHAa0030 gene, was investigated by in vivo and in vitro experiments in order to highlight its involvement in NO detoxification mechanisms. The PSHAa0030 gene was cloned and then over-expressed in a flavohaemoglobin-deficient mutant of Escherichia coli, unable to metabolise NO, and the resulting strain was studied analysing its growth properties and oxygen uptake in the presence of NO. We here demonstrate that Ph-2/2HbO protects growth and cellular respiration of the heterologous host from the toxic effect of NO-donors. Unlike in Mycobacterium tuberculosis 2/2 HbN, the deletion of the N-terminal extension of Ph-2/2HbO does not seem to reduce the NO scavenging activity, showing that the N-terminal extension is not a requirement for efficient NO detoxification. Moreover, the ferric form of Ph-2/2HbO was shown to catalyse peroxynitrite isomerisation in vitro, confirming its potential role in the scavenging of reactive nitrogen species. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Oxygen Binding and Sensing Proteins.
TI  - Suitability of different beta-galactosidases as reporter enzymes in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The suitability of three beta-galactosidases as reporter enzymes for promoter expression analyses was investigated in Bacillus subtilis with respect to various temperature conditions during cultivation and assay procedures. Starting from the hypothesis that proteins derived from diverse habitats have different advantages as reporters at different growth temperatures, the beta-galactosidases from the thermophilic organism Bacillus stearothermophilus, from the mesophilic bacterium Escherichia coli and from the psychrophilic organism Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAE79 were analysed under control of the constitutive B. subtilis lepA promoter. Subsequent expression of the beta-galactosidase genes and determination of specific activities was performed at different cultivation and assay temperatures using B. subtilis as host. Surprisingly, the obtained results demonstrated that the highest activities over a broad cultivation temperature range were obtained using the beta-galactosidase from the mesophilic bacterium E. coli whereas the enzymes from the thermophilic and psychrophilic bacteria revealed a more restricted usability in terms of cultivation temperature.
TI  - Improving protein crystal quality by the without-oil microbatch method: crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of glutathione synthetase from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis.
AB  - Glutathione synthetases catalyze the ATP-dependent synthesis of glutathione from  l-gamma-glutamyl- l-cysteine and glycine. Although these enzymes have been sequenced and characterized from a variety of biological sources, their exact catalytic mechanism is not fully understood and nothing is known about their adaptation at extremophilic environments. Glutathione synthetase from the Antarctic eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (PhGshB) has been expressed, purified and successfully crystallized. An overall improvement of the crystal quality has been obtained by adapting the crystal growth conditions found with vapor diffusion experiments to the without-oil microbatch method. The best crystals of PhGshB diffract to 2.34 A resolution and belong to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 83.28 A, b = 119.88 A, c = 159.82 A. Refinement of the model, obtained using phases derived from the structure of the same enzyme from Escherichia coli by molecular replacement, is in progress. The structural determination will provide the first structural characterization of a psychrophilic glutathione synthetase reported to date.
TI  - Structural investigation and biological activity of the lipooligosaccharide from  the psychrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAB 23.
AB  - Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAB 23 is a Gram-negative psychrophilic bacterium  isolated from the Antarctic coastal sea. To survive in these conditions psychrophilic bacteria have evolved typical membrane lipids and "antifreeze" proteins to protect the inner side of the microorganism. As for Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane is mainly constituted by lipopoly- or lipooligosaccharides (LPS or LOS, respectively), which lean towards the external environment. Despite this, very little is known about the peculiarity of LPS from Gram-negative psychrophilic bacteria and what their role is in adaptation to cold temperature. Here we report the complete structure of the LOS from P. haloplanktis TAB 23. The lipid A was characterized by MALDI-TOF MS analysis and was tested in vitro showing a significant inhibitory effect on the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production when added in culture with LPS from Escherichia coli. The product obtained after de-O-acylation of the LPS was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS revealing the presence of several molecular species, differing in phosphorylation degree and oligosaccharide length. The oligosaccharide portion released after strong alkaline hydrolysis was purified by anion-exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) to give three main fractions, characterized by means of 2D NMR spectroscopy, which showed a very short highly phosphorylated saccharidic chain with the following general structure. alpha-Hepp3R,6R,4R'-(1-->5)-alpha-Kdop4P-(2-->6)-beta-GlcpN4R-(1-->6)-alpha-GlcpN 1P (R=-H(2)PO(3) or -H; R'=alpha-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-Galp-(1--> or H-).
TI  - Influence of growth temperature on the production of antibody Fab fragments in different microbes: a host comparative analysis.
AB  - Microorganisms encounter diverse stress conditions in their native habitats but also during fermentation processes, which have an impact on industrial process performance. These environmental stresses and the physiological reactions they trigger, including changes in the protein folding/secretion machinery, are highly interrelated. Thus, the investigation of environmental factors, which influence protein expression and secretion is still of great importance. Among all the possible stresses, temperature appears particularly important for bioreactor cultivation of recombinant hosts, as reductions of growth temperature have been reported to increase recombinant protein production in various host organisms. Therefore, the impact of temperature on the secretion of proteins with therapeutic interest, exemplified by a model antibody Fab fragment, was analyzed in five different microbial protein production hosts growing under steady-state conditions in carbon-limited chemostat cultivations. Secretory expression of the heterodimeric antibody Fab fragment was successful in all five microbial host systems, namely Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Trichoderma reesei, Escherichia coli and Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis. In this comparative analysis we show that a reduction of cultivation temperature during growth at constant growth rate had a positive effect on Fab 3H6 production in three of four analyzed microorganisms, indicating common physiological responses, which favor recombinant protein production in prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic microbes.
TI  - Structure and flexibility in cold-adapted iron superoxide dismutases: the case of the enzyme isolated from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis.
AB  - Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are metalloenzymes catalysing the dismutation of superoxide anion radicals into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Here, we present the crystal structure of a cold-adapted Fe-SOD from the Antarctic eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (PhSOD), and that of its complex with sodium azide. The structures were compared with those of the corresponding homologues having a high sequence identity with PhSOD, such as the mesophilic SOD from Escherichia coli (EcSOD) or Pseudomonas ovalis, and the psychrophilic SOD from Aliivibrio salmonicida (AsSOD). These enzymes shared a large structural similarity, such as a conserved tertiary structure and arrangement of the two monomers, an almost identical total number of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. However, the two cold-adapted SODs showed an increased flexibility of the active site residues with respect to their mesophilic homologues. Structural information was combined with a characterisation of the chemical and thermal stability performed by CD and fluorescence measurements. Despite of its psychrophilic origin, the denaturation temperature of PhSOD was comparable with that of the mesophilic EcSOD, whereas AsSOD showed a lower denaturation temperature. On the contrary, the values of the denaturant concentration at the transition midpoint were in line with the psychrophilic/mesophilic origin of the proteins. These data provide additional support to the hypothesis that cold-adapted enzymes achieve efficient catalysis at low temperature, by increasing the flexibility of their active site; moreover, our results underline how fine structural modifications can alter enzyme flexibility and/or stability without compromising the overall structure of typical rigid enzymes, such as SODs.
TI  - Characterization of the RNA degradosome of Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis: conservation of the RNase E-RhlB interaction in the gammaproteobacteria.
AB  - The degradosome is a multienzyme complex involved in mRNA degradation in Escherichia coli. The essential endoribonuclease RNase E contains a large noncatalytic region necessary for protein-protein interactions with other components of the RNA degradosome. Interacting proteins include the DEAD-box RNA helicase RhlB, the glycolytic enzyme enolase, and the exoribonuclease PNPase. Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, a psychrotolerant gammaproteobacterium distantly related to E. coli, encodes homologs of each component of the RNA degradosome. In P. haloplanktis, RNase E associates with RhlB and PNPase but not enolase. Plasmids expressing P. haloplanktis RNase E (Ph-RNase E) can complement E. coli strains lacking E. coli RNase E (Ec-RNase E). Ph-RNase E, however, does not confer a growth advantage to E. coli at low temperature. Ph-RNase E has a heterologous protein-protein interaction with Ec-RhlB but not with Ec-enolase or Ec-PNPase. The Ph-RNase E binding sites for RhlB and PNPase were mapped by deletion analysis. The PNPase binding site is located at the C-terminal end of Ph-RNase E at the same position as that in Ec-RNase E, but the sequence of the site is not conserved. The sequence of the RhlB binding site in Ph-RNase E is related to the sequence in Ec-RNase E. Together with the heterologous interaction between Ph-RNase E and Ec-RhlB, our results suggest that the underlying structural motif for the RNase E-RhlB interaction is conserved. Since the activity of Ec-RhlB requires its physical interaction with Ec-RNase E, conservation of the underlying structural motif over a large evolutionary distance could be due to constraints involved in the control of RhlB activity.
TI  - Influence of production process design on inclusion bodies protein: the case of an Antarctic flavohemoglobin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein over-production in Escherichia coli often results in formation of inclusion bodies (IBs). Some recent reports have shown that the aggregation into IBs does not necessarily mean that the target protein is inactivated and that IBs may contain a high proportion of correctly folded protein. This proportion is variable depending on the protein itself, the genetic background of the producing cells and the expression temperature. In this paper we have evaluated the influence of other production process parameters on the quality of an inclusion bodies protein. RESULTS: The present paper describes the recombinant production in Escherichia coli of the flavohemoglobin from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125. Flavohemoglobins are multidomain proteins requiring FAD and heme cofactors. The production was carried out in several different experimental setups differing in bioreactor geometry, oxygen supply and the presence of a nitrosating compound. In all production processes, the recombinant protein accumulates in IBs, from which it was solubilized in non-denaturing conditions. Comparing structural properties of the solubilized flavohemoglobins, i.e. deriving from the different process designs, our data demonstrated that the protein preparations differ significantly in the presence of cofactors (heme and FAD) and as far as their secondary and tertiary structure content is concerned. CONCLUSIONS: Data reported in this paper demonstrate that other production process parameters, besides growth temperature, can influence the structure of a recombinant product that accumulates in IBs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported example in which the structural properties of a protein solubilized from inclusion bodies have been correlated to the production process design.
TI  - Cold adaptation in DEAD-box proteins.
AB  - Spontaneous rearrangements of RNA structures are usually characterized by large activation energies and thus become very slow at low temperatures, yet RNA structure must remain dynamic even in cold-adapted (psychrophilic) organisms. DEAD-box proteins constitute a ubiquitous family of RNA-dependent ATPases that can often unwind short RNA duplexes in vitro (helicase activity), hence the belief that one of their major (though not exclusive) roles in vivo is to assist in RNA rearrangements. Here, we compare two Escherichia coli DEAD-box proteins and their orthologs from the psychrophilic bacteria Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis and Colwellia psychrerythraea from the point of view of enzymatic properties. One of these proteins (SrmB) is involved in ribosome assembly, whereas the other (RhlE) presumably participates in both mRNA degradation and ribosome assembly; in vitro, RhlE is far more active as a helicase than SrmB. The activation energy associated with the ATPase activity of the psychrophilic SrmB is lower than for its mesophilic counterpart, making it more active at low temperatures. In contrast, in the case of psychrophilic RhlE, it is the RNA unwinding activity, not the ATPase activity, that has a reduced activation energy and is therefore cold-adapted. We argue that these different modes of cold adaptation reflect the likely function of these proteins in vivo: RNA helicase for RhlE and ATP-dependent RNA binding for SrmB. The cold adaptation of helicases like RhlE presumably facilitates RNA metabolism in psychrophilic bacteria.
TI  - Structure and dynamics of cold-adapted enzymes as investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy and MD. The case of an esterase from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis.
AB  - Psychrophiles are cold-adapted organisms that produce enzymes that display a high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures. In recent years, these low-temperature working enzymes have attracted the attention of scientists because of their peculiar properties that render them particularly useful in investigating the relationship between enzyme stability and flexibility. Recently, a new esterase was identified and isolated from the cold-adapted organism Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis. The enzyme, denoted as PhEST, presents a dimeric structure with a molecular mass of 60 kDa. In this work, we used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the functional and structural properties of PhEST over a wide range of temperature. The obtained results reveal that the structure of PhEST is quite stable up to 40 degrees C. In fact, the protein starts to denature at about 45 degrees C through the formation of new secondary structural elements such as intermolecular beta-sheets. In addition, our results indicate that the flexibility of protein segment 55-65 (335-345 in subunit B), which corresponds to a loop near the active site of the enzyme, plays a crucial role in the protein function.
TI  - Co-immunopurification of multiprotein complexes containing RNA-degrading enzymes.
AB  - Co-immunopurification is a classical technique in which antiserum raised against  a specific protein is used to purify a multiprotein complex. We describe work from our laboratory in which co-immunopurification was used to characterize the RNA degradosome of Escherichia coli, a multiprotein complex involved in RNA processing and mRNA degradation. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against either RNase E or PNPase, two RNA degrading enzymes in the RNA degradosome, were used in co-immunopurification experiments aimed at studying the assembly of the RNA degradosome and mapping protein-protein interactions within the complex. In E. coli, this method has been largely supplanted by approaches in which proteins are engineered to contain tags that interact with commercially available antibodies. Nevertheless, we believe that the method described here is valid for the study of bacteria in which the genetic engineering needed to introduce tagged proteins is difficult or nonexistent. As an example, we briefly discuss ongoing work in our laboratory on the characterization of RNase E in the psychrotolerant bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis.
TI  - Molecular cloning, expression and characterization of alpha-amylase gene from a marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. MY-1.
AB  - A gene (amyA) encoding an extracellular alpha-amylase from a marine bacterium Pseudoalteromnonas sp. MY-1 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. It comprised an open-reading-frame of 2,007 base pairs and encoded a protein of 669 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 73,770 daltons and a pI of 5.15. The entire amino acid sequence of amyA gene showed 86% similarity to the alpha-amylase preproprotein from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis. It consisted of a signal peptide, alpha-amylase catalytic domain and an amy C domain. The recombinant amylase was purified to homogeneity and biochemically characterized. The enzyme revealed maximum activity at pH 7.0 and 40 degrees C. The enzyme hydrolyzed soluble starch and some maltooligosaccharides to several oligosaccharides, and maltose was the common product from different substrates.
TI  - Cloning, expression and physicochemical characterization of a di-heme cytochrome  c (4) from the psychrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125.
AB  - The 20-kDa di-heme cytochrome c (4) from the psycrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and investigated through UV-vis and (1)H NMR spectroscopies and protein voltammetry. The model structure was computed using the X-ray structure of Pseudomonas stutzeri cytochrome c (4) as a template. The protein shows unprecedented properties within the cytochrome c (4) family, including (1) an almost nonpolar surface charge distribution, (2) the absence of high-spin heme Fe(III) states, indicative of a thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert axial heme His,Met coordination, and (3) identical E degrees ' values for the two heme centers (+0.322 V vs the standard hydrogen elecrode). At pH extremes, both heme groups undergo the "acid" and "alkaline" conformational transitions typical of class I cytochromes c, involving ligand-exchange equilibria, whereas at intermediate pH values their electronic properties are sensitive to several residue ionizations.
TI  - Rapid chemotactic response enables marine bacteria to exploit ephemeral microscale nutrient patches.
AB  - Because ocean water is typically resource-poor, bacteria may gain significant growth advantages if they can exploit the ephemeral nutrient patches originating from numerous, small sources. Although this interaction has been proposed to enhance biogeochemical transformation rates in the ocean, it remains questionable whether bacteria are able to efficiently use patches before physical mechanisms dissipate them. Here we show that the rapid chemotactic response of the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis substantially enhances its ability to exploit nutrient patches before they dissipate. We investigated two types of patches important in the ocean: nutrient pulses and nutrient plumes, generated for example from lysed algae and sinking organic particles, respectively. We used microfluidic devices to create patches with environmentally realistic dimensions and dynamics. The accumulation of P. haloplanktis in response to a nutrient pulse led to formation of bacterial hot spots within tens of seconds, resulting in a 10-fold higher nutrient exposure for the fastest 20% of the population compared with nonmotile cells. Moreover, the chemotactic response of P. haloplanktis was >10 times faster than the classic chemotaxis model Escherichia coli, leading to twice the nutrient exposure. We demonstrate that such rapid response allows P. haloplanktis to colonize nutrient plumes for realistic particle sinking speeds, with up to a 4-fold nutrient exposure compared with nonmotile cells. These results suggest that chemotactic swimming strategies of marine bacteria in patchy nutrient seascapes exert strong influence on carbon turnover rates by triggering the formation of microscale hot spots of bacterial productivity.
TI  - Glutathionylation of the iron superoxide dismutase from the psychrophilic eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis.
AB  - Our previous work showed that the adduct between beta-mercaptoethanol and the single cysteine residue (Cys57) in superoxide dismutase from the psychrophilic eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (PhSOD) reduces the enzyme inactivation by peroxynitrite. In this work, immunoblotting experiments prove that peroxynitrite inactivation of PhSOD involves formation of nitrotyrosine residue(s). In order to study the role of Cys57 as a redox-sensor residue modifiable by cellular thiols, a recombinant PhSOD and two Cys57 mutants were produced and characterized. Recombinant and mutant enzymes share similar activity and peroxynitrite inactivation, but different reactivity towards three glutathione forms. Indeed, oxidized glutathione and S-nitrosoglutathione, but reduced glutathione, lead to S-glutathionylation of recombinant PhSOD. This new covalent modification for a Fe-SOD does not occur in both Cys57 mutants, thus indicating that its target is Cys57. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that S-glutathionylation of Cys57 takes place also with endogenous PhSOD. Formation of this mixed disulfide in PhSOD protects the enzyme from tyrosine nitration and peroxynitrite inactivation. PhSOD undergoes S-glutathionylation during its overproduction in E. coli cells and in a growing culture of P. haloplanktis. In both cases the extent of glutathionylated PhSOD is enhanced upon cell exposure to oxidative agents. We suggest that S-glutathionylation of PhSOD could represent a further cold-adaptation strategy to improve the antioxidant cellular defence mechanism.
TI  - Genetics for Pseudoalteromonas provides tools to manipulate marine bacterial virus PM2.
AB  - The genetic manipulation of marine double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophage PM2  (Corticoviridae) has been limited so far. The isolation of an autonomously replicating DNA element of Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 and construction of a shuttle vector replicating in both Escherichia coli and Pseudoalteromonas enabled us to design a set of conjugative shuttle plasmids encoding tRNA suppressors for amber mutations. Using a host strain carrying a suppressor plasmid allows the introduction and analysis of nonsense mutations in PM2. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of a suppressor-sensitive PM2 sus2 mutant deficient in the structural protein P10. To infect and replicate, PM2 delivers its 10-kbp genome across the cell envelopes of two gram-negative Pseudoalteromonas species. The events leading to the internalization of the circular supercoiled dsDNA are puzzling. In a poorly understood process that follows receptor recognition, the virion capsid disassembles and the internal membrane fuses with the host outer membrane. While beginning to unravel the mechanism of this process, we found that protein P10 plays an essential role in the host cell penetration.
TI  - The truncated hemoglobins in the Antarctic psychrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125.
AB  - The genome sequence of the Antarctic Gram-negative marine eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 is a potential source of useful data on proteins from a cold-adapted microorganism. Identifying the bases of protein adaptation to higher or lower temperatures is important to understand the relationship between structure/function and life history on the Earth. The P. haloplanktis TAC125 genome contains three genes in distinct positions on chromosome I, named PSHAa0030, PSHAa2217 and PSHAa0458. These genes encode three truncated hemoglobins. The amino-acid identity between the three hemoglobins is less than 25% suggesting that these proteins may have different function(s) in bacterial cellular metabolism. The hemoglobin encoded by the PSHAa0030 gene has been cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and structurally characterised. This truncated hemoglobin is monomeric; circular dichroism shows high temperature resistance. The optical spectra of oxygenated and CO forms are similar to those of other truncated hemoglobins. Phylogenetic analyses show that two truncated globins encoded by the PSHAa0030 and PSHAa2217 genes belong to group II, and the third one encoded by PSHAa0458 to group I.
TI  - The psychrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas halosplanktis TAC125 possesses a gene coding for a cold-adapted feruloyl esterase activity that shares homology with esterase enzymes from gamma-proteobacteria and yeast.
AB  - The complete genome of the psychrophilic bacteria Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis  TAC 125, recently published, owns a gene coding for a putative esterase activity corresponding to the ORF PSHAa1385, also classified in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database (CAZY) belonging to family 1 of carbohydrate esterase proteins. This ORF is 843 bp in length and codes for a protein of 280 amino acid residues. In this study we characterized and cloned the PSHAa1385 gene in Escherichia coli. We also characterized the recombinant protein by biochemical and biophysical methodologies. The PSHAa1385 gene sequence showed a significant homology with several carboxyl-esterase and acetyl-esterase genes from gamma-proteobacteria genera and yeast. The recombinant protein exhibited a significant activity towards pNP-acetate, alpha-and beta-naphthyl acetate as generic substrates, and 4-methylumbelliferyl p-trimethylammonio cinnamate chloride (MUTMAC) as a specific substrate, indicating that the protein exhibits a feruloyl esterase activity that it is displayed by similar enzymes present in other organisms. Finally, a three-dimensional model of the protein was built and the amino acid residues involved in the catalytic function of the protein were identified.
TI  - Molecular and functional properties of the psychrophilic elongation factor G from the Antarctic Eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125.
AB  - The molecular and functional properties of the elongation factor (EF) G from the  psychrophilic Antarctic eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (Ph) were studied. PhEF-G catalyzed protein synthesis in vitro that was inhibited by fusidic acid, an antibiotic specifically acting on EF-G. The EF interacted with GDP only in the presence of P. haloplanktis ribosome and fusidic acid with an affinity similar to that displayed by Escherichia coli EF-G. The psychrophilic translocase elicited a ribosome-dependent GTPase that was competitively inhibited by GDP, the slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog GppNHp, and the protein synthesis inhibitor ppGDP. The temperature dependence of the activity of PhEF-G reached its maximum at least 26 degrees C beyond the growth temperature of P. haloplanktis (4-20 degrees C). The heat inactivation profile of the ribosome-dependent GTPase of PhEF-G gave a temperature for half inactivation (46 degrees C), significantly lower than that for half denaturation measured by either UV- (57 degrees C) or fluorescence-melting (62 degrees C). This finding was attributed to a different effect of the temperature on the catalytic domain with respect to that elicited on the other domains constituting the EF, thus confirming the differential molecular flexibility present in psychrophilic enzymes. A molecular model, based on the 3D coordinates of a thermophilic EF-G, showed differences only in connecting loops.
TI  - Optimization of recombinant human nerve growth factor production in the psychrophilic Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis.
AB  - The optimization of production strategy is a very useful tool to attain high level of recombinant protein at a low cost. A promising biotechnological application of psychrophilic bacteria is their use as non-conventional host for the recombinant production of useful proteins. The lowering of the expression temperature can in fact facilitate the correct folding of heterologous proteins that accumulate in insoluble form as inclusion bodies when produced in Escherichia coli. An example of such "difficult" proteins is the human nerve growth factor (hNGF). The gene encoding the mature form of hNGF was expressed in the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 at 4 degrees C. Western blotting experiments demonstrated that the protein was produced in soluble form and translocated in the periplasmic space. Furthermore, an analytical gel filtration chromatography confirmed that the recombinant protein was largely in dimeric form. For a more efficient recombinant rhNGF production, the influence of cultivation operational strategies and growth conditions (medium composition, temperature, specific growth rate) on biomass yield and recombinant protein production was investigated in batch and chemostat cultivations. The highest product yield of soluble rhNGF (7.5mg(NGF)g(dryweight)(-1)) has been achieved in batch culture at 4 degrees C on Schatz medium with addition of tryptone and vitamins.
TI  - Recombinant expression of Toluene o-Xylene Monooxygenase (ToMO) from Pseudomonas  stutzeri OX1 in the marine Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125.
AB  - The psychrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125, isolated from  Antarctic seawater, was used as recipient for a biodegradative gene of the mesophilic Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1. tou cluster, coding for Toluene o-Xylene Monooxygenase (ToMO), was successfully cloned and expressed into a "cold expression" vector. Apparent catalytic parameters of the recombinant microorganisms on three different substrates were determined and compared with those exhibited by Escherichia coli recombinant cells expressing ToMO. Production of a catalytically efficient TAC/tou microorganism supports the possibility of developing specific degradative capabilities for the bioremediation of chemically contaminated marine environments and of industrial effluents characterised by low temperatures.
TI  - Psychrophilic superoxide dismutase from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis: biochemical characterization and identification of a highly reactive cysteine residue.
AB  - A psychrophilic superoxide dismutase (SOD) has been characterized from the Antarctic eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (Ph). PhSOD is a homodimeric iron-containing enzyme and displays a high specific activity, even at low temperature. The enzyme is inhibited by sodium azide and inactivated by hydrogen peroxide; it is also very sensitive to peroxynitrite, a physiological inactivator of the human mitochondrial Mn-SOD. Even though PhSOD is isolated from a cold-adapted micro-organism, its heat stability is well above the maximum growth temperature of P. haloplanktis, a feature common to other Fe- and Mn-SODs. The primary structure of PhSOD was determined by a combination of mass spectrometry and automated Edman degradation. The polypeptide chain is made of 192 amino acid residues, corresponding to a molecular mass of 21251 Da. The alignment with other Fe- and Mn-SODs showed a high amino acid identity with Fe-SOD from Vibrio cholerae (79%) and Escherichia coli (70%). A significant similarity is also shared with human mitochondrial Mn-SOD. PhSOD has the unique and highly reactive Cys57 residue, located in a variable region of the protein. The three-dimensional model of the PhSOD monomer indicates that Cys57 is included in a region, whose structural organization apparently discriminates between dimeric and tetrameric SODs. This residue forms a disulfide adduct with beta-mercaptoethanol, when this reducing agent is added in the purification procedure. The reactivity of Cys57 leads also to the formation of a disulfide bridge between two PhSOD subunits in specific denaturing conditions. The possible modification of Cys57 by physiological thiols, eventually regulating the PhSOD functioning, is discussed.
TI  - Bioinformatic analysis of an unusual gene-enzyme relationship in the arginine biosynthetic pathway among marine gamma proteobacteria: implications concerning the formation of N-acetylated intermediates in prokaryotes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The N-acetylation of L-glutamate is regarded as a universal metabolic strategy to commit glutamate towards arginine biosynthesis. Until recently, this reaction was thought to be catalyzed by either of two enzymes: (i) the classical N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS, gene argA) first characterized in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa several decades ago and also present in vertebrates, or (ii) the bifunctional version of ornithine acetyltransferase (OAT, gene argJ) present in Bacteria, Archaea and many Eukaryotes. This paper focuses on a new and surprising aspect of glutamate acetylation. We recently showed that in Moritella abyssi and M. profunda, two marine gamma proteobacteria, the gene for the last enzyme in arginine biosynthesis (argH) is fused to a short sequence that corresponds to the C-terminal, N-acetyltransferase-encoding domain of NAGS and is able to complement an argA mutant of E. coli. Very recently, other authors identified in Mycobacterium tuberculosis an independent gene corresponding to this short C-terminal domain and coding for a new type of NAGS. We have investigated the two prokaryotic Domains for patterns of gene-enzyme relationships in the first committed step of arginine biosynthesis. RESULTS: The argH-A fusion, designated argH(A), and discovered in Moritella was found to be present in (and confined to) marine gamma proteobacteria of the Alteromonas- and Vibrio-like group. Most of them have a classical NAGS with the exception of Idiomarina loihiensis and Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis which nevertheless can grow in the absence of arginine and therefore appear to rely on the arg(A) sequence for arginine biosynthesis. Screening prokaryotic genomes for virtual argH-X 'fusions' where X stands for a homologue of arg(A), we retrieved a large number of Bacteria and several Archaea, all of them devoid of a classical NAGS. In the case of Thermus thermophilus and Deinococcus radiodurans, the arg(A)-like sequence clusters with argH in an operon-like fashion. In this group of sequences, we find the short novel NAGS of the type identified in M. tuberculosis. Among these organisms, at least Thermus, Mycobacterium and Streptomyces species appear to rely on this short NAGS version for arginine biosynthesis. CONCLUSION: The gene-enzyme relationship for the first committed step of arginine biosynthesis should now be considered in a new perspective. In addition to bifunctional OAT, nature appears to implement at least three alternatives for the acetylation of glutamate. It is possible to propose evolutionary relationships between them starting from the same ancestral N-acetyltransferase domain. In M. tuberculosis and many other bacteria, this domain evolved as an independent enzyme, whereas it fused either with a carbamate kinase fold to give the classical NAGS (as in E. coli) or with argH as in marine gamma proteobacteria. Moreover, there is an urgent need to clarify the current nomenclature since the same gene name argA has been used to designate structurally different entities. Clarifying the confusion would help to prevent erroneous genomic annotation.
TI  - The thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase system in the cold-adapted bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125: discovery of a novel disulfide oxidoreductase enzyme.
AB  - In prokaryotes, protein disulfide bond oxidation, reduction and isomerization are catalyzed by members of the thioredoxin superfamily, characterized by the conserved C-X-X-C motif in their active site. Thioredoxins and glutaredoxins contribute to the reducing power in the cytoplasm, while the Dsb system catalyzes disulfide bonds formation in the periplasmic space. This paper addresses the question of disulfide bonds formation in a cold-adapted micro-organism, Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125 (PhTAC125) by characterizing the DsbA system. We found distinctive features respect mesophilic counterparts that highlighted for the first time the occurrence of two adjacent chromosomal DsbA genes organised in a functional operon. The sophisticated transcriptional regulation mechanism that controls the expression of these two genes was also defined. The two DsbA proteins, named PhDsbA and PhDsbA2, respectively, were expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized. Results reported in this paper provide some insights into disulfide bonds formation in a micro organism isolated in the Antarctic sea water.
TI  - Elongation factor Ts from the Antarctic eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125: biochemical characterization and cloning of the encoding gene.
AB  - The elongation factor Ts was isolated from the psychrophilic Antarctic eubacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125 strain (PhEF-Ts), and its functional properties were studied. At 0 degrees C PhEF-Ts enhanced the [(3)H]GDP/GDP exchange rate on the preformed PhEF-Tu.[(3)H]GDP complex by 2 orders of magnitude even at very low Tu:Ts ratio, by lowering the energy of activation of the exchange reaction. PhEF-Ts is a monomeric protein, and in solution it forms a stable dimeric complex with PhEF-Tu. The PhEF-Ts encoding gene was cloned and sequenced. Its structural organization was similar to that of Escherichia coli because it showed at its 5' end the gene encoding the ribosomal protein S2. The translated amino acid sequence had a calculated molecular weight of 30762, and showed a high sequence identity with E. coli (68%) and Thermus thermophilus (44%) EF-Ts. The PhEF-Ts primary structure contains well-preserved almost all the amino acid residues interacting at the interfaces of the E. coli EF-Ts.EF-Tu complex. Finally, the high concentration of PhEF-Ts in this psychrophilic eubacterium might represent an adaptive tool to ensure an efficient nucleotide exchange even at low temperature.
TI  - Kinetic and structural optimization to catalysis at low temperatures in a psychrophilic cellulase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis.
AB  - The cold-adapted cellulase CelG has been purified from the culture supernatant of the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis and the gene coding for this enzyme has been cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. This cellulase is composed of three structurally and functionally distinct regions: an N-terminal catalytic domain belonging to glycosidase family 5 and a C-terminal cellulose-binding domain belonging to carbohydrate-binding module family 5. The linker of 107 residues connecting both domains is one of the longest found in cellulases, and optimizes substrate accessibility to the catalytic domain by drastically increasing the surface of cellulose available to a bound enzyme molecule. The psychrophilic enzyme is closely related to the cellulase Cel5 from Erwinia chrysanthemi. Both kcat and kcat/K(m) values at 4 degrees C for the psychrophilic cellulase are similar to the values for Cel5 at 30-35 degrees C, suggesting temperature adaptation of the kinetic parameters. The thermodynamic parameters of activation of CelG suggest a heat-labile, relatively disordered active site with low substrate affinity, in agreement with the experimental data. The structure of CelG has been constructed by homology modelling with a molecule of cellotetraose docked into the active site. No structural alteration related to cold-activity can be found in the catalytic cleft, whereas several structural factors in the overall structure can explain the weak thermal stability, suggesting that the loss of stability provides the required active-site mobility at low temperatures.
TI  - Recombinant protein production in Antarctic Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - This review reports some results from our laboratory on the setting up of a psychrophilic expression system for the homologous/heterologous protein production in cold-adapted bacteria by using natural plasmids as cloning vectors. By screening some Antarctic bacteria for the presence of extrachromosomal elements, we identified three new plasmids, pMtBL from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125, and pTAUp and pTADw, from Psychrobacter sp. TA144. The latter autoreplicating elements were isolated, cloned, and fully sequenced and their molecular characterisation was carried out; however, we focused our attention on the small multicopy plasmid, pMtBL, from the Gram-negative P. haloplanktis TAC125 strain. This episome turned out to be an interesting extrachromosomal element, since it displays unique molecular features as its transcriptional inactivity. Being cryptic, the inheritance of pMtBL totally relied on the efficiency of its replication function. This function was bound to a region of about 850 bp, identified by an in vivo assay based on the possibility to efficiently mobilize plasmidic DNA from a mesophilic donor (Escherichia coli) to psychrophilic recipient by intergeneric conjugation. This information was instrumental in the construction of a shuttle vector, able to replicate either in E. coli or in several cold-adapted hosts (clone Q). Since the conversion of a cloning system into an expression vector requires the insertion of transcription and translation regulative sequences, the corresponding signals from the aspartate aminotransferase gene isolated from P. haloplanktis TAC125 were inserted, generating the pFF vector. To investigate the possibility of obtaining recombinant proteins in this cold-adapted host, we used the psychrophilic alpha-amylase from the Antarctic bacterium P. haloplanktis TAB23 (previously known as Alteromonas haloplanktis A23) as a model enzyme to be produced. Our results demonstrate that the cold-adapted enzyme was not only produced but also efficiently secreted by the recombinant PhTAC125 cells. The described expression system represents the first example of heterologous protein production based on a true cold-adapted replicon.
TI  - The precursor of a psychrophilic alpha-amylase: structural characterization and insights into cold adaptation.
AB  - The alpha-amylase precursor from the bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis possesses a propeptide at the C-terminus possibly responsible for outer membrane translocation. Unlike the predicted beta-barrel of autotransporters, this C-terminal propeptide displays a noticeable alpha-helix content. It is connected to the enzyme by a disordered linker and has no significant interaction with the catalytic domain. The microcalorimetric pattern of the precursor also demonstrates that the stability of protein domains may evolve differently.
TI  - GroEL from the psychrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125: molecular characterization and gene cloning.
AB  - The heat shock response of the psychrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125 (PhTAC 125) gives rise to the production of several inducible proteins. Among these, the protein corresponding to a 55-kDa band on SDS-PAGE was purified to homogeneity and identified as a GroEL-like protein. The gene coding for this protein (PhGroEL) was cloned and sequenced; the deduced amino acid sequence shows 82% sequence identity to GroEL from Escherichia coli (EcGroEL). The ORF found in the 5' upstream region codes for a homologue of the GroES from E. coli (PhGroES, 71% sequence identity to EcGroES). PhGroEL shows a chaperone activity and can use GroES from E. coli as a co-chaperone. PhGroEL melting temperature, 6 degrees C lower than that of EcGroEL, and equilibrium unfolding experiments in urea showed a less stable protein architecture for the psychrophilic GroEL. The data herein reported demonstrate that PhGroEL cold adaptation consists in a shift of the protein properties toward lower temperatures without increasing catalytic efficiency at low temperatures. Primary extension analysis depicted a complex organization of regulative elements for the operon containing the genes coding for PhgroES and PhgroEL (PhgroE), suggesting that a fine-tuning of transcription can also be involved in thermal adaptation of PhTAC 125.
TI  - Marine bacterial organisation around point-like sources of amino acids.
AB  - Abstract To better understand the trigger for and use of motility in marine bacterial chemotaxis, specific (amino acids) chemical stimuli were used to test the effect on bacterial speed and reorientation. An assay system was developed to analyse bacterial behavioural responses to point-like nutrient sources (beads 10-40 mum). The marine bacteria Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, Shewanella putrefaciens, Deleya marina, the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli and an enriched assemblage of marine bacteria were used in the assay. E. coli responded to the amino acids (e.g. serine, leucine) in this assay in a manner similar to the classical capillary plating method, and accumulated near the attractants using biased random walks and maximum speeds of less than 30 mum s(-1). The marine bacteria travelled more than 100 mum s(-1) and reversed direction instead of randomly tumbling to reorientate. Marine bacteria also showed different chemotactic responses. The enriched marine community and P. haloplanktis were repelled by serine while leucine was an attractant for all three marine isolates. More importantly marine bacteria formed band specific distances (>20 mum) away from individual beads. The bands were composed of free-swimming bacteria rather than bacteria attached to the beads or chamber surfaces. The bands' formation time (25-180 s) and width (5-20 mum) varied depending on the bacterial strains and attractant. This variation in chemotactic responses by the marine isolates may reflect adaptations to specific ecological niches of bacterioplankton in the ocean. However, band forming ability by marine bacteria has still only been reported in experimental studies, nutrient coupling between nutrient sources and bands of chemotactic marine bacteria have yet to be detected in the natural environment. The fragility of the bands, a clear association between free-swimming bacteria and nutrient, indicates the difficulty and potentially sets limits for finding microzones of bacteria around particles in the open ocean.
TI  - Secretion of alpha-amylase from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAB23: two different pathways in different hosts.
AB  - Secretion of cold-adapted alpha-amylase from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAB23 was studied in three Antarctic bacteria. We demonstrated that the enzyme is specifically secreted in the psychrophilic hosts even in the absence of a protein domain that has been previously reported to be necessary for alpha-amylase secretion in Escherichia coli. The occurrence of two different secretion pathways in different hosts is proposed.
TI  - Cloning of two pectate lyase genes from the marine Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis strain ANT/505 and characterization of the enzymes.
AB  - A marine Antarctic psychrotolerant bacterium (strain ANT/505), isolated from sea  ice-covered surface water from the Southern Ocean, showed pectinolytic activity on citrus pectin agar. The sequencing of the 16S rRNA of isolate ANT/505 indicates a taxonomic affiliation to Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis. The supernatant of this strain showed three different pectinolytic activities after growth on citrus pectin. By activity screening of a genomic DNA library of isolate ANT/505 in Escherichia coli, two different pectinolytic clones could be isolated. Subcloning and sequencing revealed two open reading frames (ORF) of 1,671 and 1,968 nt, corresponding to proteins of 68 and 75 kDa, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence of the two ORFs showed homology to pectate lyases from Erwinia chrysanthemi and Aspergillus nidulans. The pectate lyases contain signal peptides of 17 and 26 amino acids that were correctly processed after overexpression in E. coli BL21. Both enzymes were purified by anionic exchange chromatography. Maximal enzymatic activities for both pectate lyases were observed at 30 degrees C and a pH range of 9 to 10. The Km values of both lyases for pectate and citrus pectin were 1 g l(-1) and 5 g l(-1), respectively. Calcium was required for activity on pectic substrates, whereas the addition of 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) resulted in complete inhibition of the enzymes. These two enzymes represent the first pectate lyases isolated and characterized from a cold-adapted marine bacterium.
TI  - Cold-adapted beta-galactosidase from the Antarctic psychrophile Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis.
AB  - The beta-galactosidase from the Antarctic gram-negative bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAE 79 was purified to homogeneity. The nucleotide sequence and the NH(2)-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme indicate that the beta-galactosidase subunit is composed of 1,038 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 118,068. This beta-galactosidase shares structural properties with Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (comparable subunit mass, 51% amino sequence identity, conservation of amino acid residues involved in catalysis, similar optimal pH value, and requirement for divalent metal ions) but is characterized by a higher catalytic efficiency on synthetic and natural substrates and by a shift of apparent optimum activity toward low temperatures and lower thermal stability. The enzyme also differs by a higher pI (7.8) and by specific thermodynamic activation parameters. P. haloplanktis beta-galactosidase was expressed in E. coli, and the recombinant enzyme displays properties identical to those of the wild-type enzyme. Heat-induced unfolding monitored by intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy showed lower melting point values for both P. haloplanktis wild-type and recombinant beta-galactosidase compared to the mesophilic enzyme. Assays of lactose hydrolysis in milk demonstrate that P. haloplanktis beta-galactosidase can outperform the current commercial beta-galactosidase from Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, suggesting that the cold-adapted beta-galactosidase could be used to hydrolyze lactose in dairy products processed in refrigerated plants.
TI  - A DNA ligase from the psychrophile Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis gives insights  into the adaptation of proteins to low temperatures.
AB  - The cloning, overexpression and characterization of a cold-adapted DNA ligase from the Antarctic sea water bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis are described. Protein sequence analysis revealed that the cold-adapted Ph DNA ligase shows a significant level of sequence similarity to other NAD+-dependent DNA ligases and contains several previously described sequence motifs. Also, a decreased level of arginine and proline residues in Ph DNA ligase could be involved in the cold-adaptation strategy. Moreover, 3D modelling of the N-terminal domain of Ph DNA ligase clearly indicates that this domain is destabilized compared with its thermophilic homologue. The recombinant Ph DNA ligase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Mass spectroscopy experiments indicated that the purified enzyme is mainly in an adenylated form with a molecular mass of 74 593 Da. Ph DNA ligase shows similar overall catalytic properties to other NAD+-dependent DNA ligases but is a cold-adapted enzyme as its catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) at low and moderate temperatures is higher than that of its mesophilic counterpart E. coli DNA ligase. A kinetic comparison of three enzymes adapted to different temperatures (P. haloplanktis, E. coli and Thermus scotoductus DNA ligases) indicated that an increased kcat is the most important adaptive parameter for enzymatic activity at low temperatures, whereas a decreased Km for the nicked DNA substrate seems to allow T. scotoductus DNA ligase to work efficiently at high temperatures. Besides being useful for investigation of the adaptation of enzymes to extreme temperatures, P. haloplanktis DNA ligase, which is very efficient at low temperatures, offers a novel tool for biotechnology.
TI  - Aspartate aminotransferase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125. Cloning, expression, properties, and molecular modelling.
AB  - The gene encoding aspartate aminotransferase from the psychrophilic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125 was cloned, sequenced and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein (PhAspAT) was characterized both at the structural and functional level in comparison with the E. coli enzyme (EcAspAT), which is the most closely related (52% sequence identity) bacterial counterpart. PhAspAT is rapidly inactivated at 50 degrees C (half-life = 6.8 min), whereas at this temperature EcAspAT is stable for at least 3 h. The optimal temperature for PhAspAT activity is approximately 64 degrees C, which is some 11 degrees C below that of EcAspAT. The protein thermal stability was investigated by following changes in both tryptophan fluorescence and amide ellipticity; this clearly suggested that a first structural transition occurs at approximately 50 degrees C for PhAspAT. These results agree with the expected thermolability of a psychrophilic enzyme, although the observed stability is much higher than generally found for enzymes isolated from cold-loving organisms. Furthermore, in contrast with the higher efficiency exhibited by several extracellular psychrophilic enzymes, both kcat and kcat/Km of PhAspAT are significantly lower than those of EcAspAT over the whole temperature range. This behaviour possibly suggests that the adaptation of this class of endocellular enzymes to a cold environment may have only made them less stable and not more efficient. The affinity of PhAspAT for both amino-acid and 2-oxo-acid substrates decreases with increasing temperature. However, binding of maleate and 2-methyl-L-aspartate, which both inhibit the initial steps of catalysis, does not change over the temperature range tested. Therefore, the observed temperature effect may occur at any of the steps of the catalytic mechanism after the formation of the external aldimine. A molecular model of PhAspAT was constructed on the basis of sequence homology with other AspATs. Interestingly, it shows no insertion or extension of loops, but some cavities and a decrease in side chain packing can be observed.
TI  - The alpha-amylase gene amyH of the moderate halophile Halomonas meridiana: cloning and molecular characterization.
AB  - Two types of Tn1732-induced mutants defective in extracellular amylase activity were isolated from the moderate halophile Halomonas meridiana DSM 5425. Type I mutants displayed amylase activity in the periplasm, and were unable to use any of the carbon sources tested, including starch and its hydrolysis product maltose. The type II mutant was affected in the gene responsible for the synthesis of the extracellular alpha-amylase. This gene (amyH) was isolated by functional complementation of mutant II and sequenced. The deduced protein (AmyH) showed a high degree of homology to a proposed family of alpha-amylases consisting of enzymes from Alteromonas (Pseudoalteromonas) haloplanktis, Thermomonospora curvata, streptomycetes, insects and mammals. AmyH contained the four highly conserved regions in amylases, as well as a high content of acidic amino acids. The amyH gene was functional in the moderate halophile Halomonas elongata and, when cloned in a multicopy vector, in Escherichia coli. AmyH is believed to be the first extracellular-amylase-encoding gene isolated from a moderate halophile, a group of extremophiles of great biotechnological potential. In addition, H. meridiana and H. elongata were able to secrete the thermostable alpha-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis, indicating that members of the genus Halomonas are good candidates for use as cell factories to produce heterologous extracellular enzymes.
TI  - Characterization of the C-terminal propeptide involved in bacterial wall spanning of alpha-amylase from the psychrophile Alteromonas haloplanctis.
AB  - The antarctic psychrophile Alteromonas haloplanctis secretes a Ca2+- and Cl--dependent alpha-amylase. The nucleotide sequence of the amy gene and the amino acid sequences of the gene products indicate that the alpha-amylase precursor is a preproenzyme composed by the signal peptide (24 residues), the mature alpha-amylase (453 residues, 49 kDa), and a long C-terminal propeptide or secretion helper (192 residues, 21 kDa). In cultures of the wild-type strain, the 70-kDa precursor is secreted at the mid-exponential phase and is cleaved by a nonspecific protease into the mature enzyme and the propeptide. The purified C-terminal propeptide displays several features common to beta-pleated transmembrane proteins. It has no intramolecular chaperone function because active alpha-amylase is expressed by Escherichia coli in the absence of the propeptide coding region. In E. coli, the 70-kDa precursor is directed toward the supernatant. When the alpha-amylase coding region is excised from the gene, the secretion helper can still promote its own membrane spanning. It can also accept a foreign passenger, as shown by the extracellular routing of a beta-lactamase-propeptide fusion protein.
