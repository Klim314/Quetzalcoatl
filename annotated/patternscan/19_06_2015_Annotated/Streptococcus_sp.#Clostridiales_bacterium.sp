TI  == susceptibility to campylobacter infection is associated with the species composition of the human fecal microbiota.
AB  == the gut microbiota is essential for human health, but very little is known about  how the composition of this ecosystem can influence and respond to bacterial infections. here we address this by prospectively studying the gut microbiota composition before, during, and after natural campylobacter infection in exposed  poultry abattoir workers. the gut microbiota composition was analyzed with 16s amplicon sequencing of fecal samples from poultry abattoir workers during the peak season of campylobacter infection in sweden. the gut microbiota compositions were compared between individuals who became culture positive for campylobacter and those who remained negative. individuals who became campylobacter positive had a significantly higher abundance of bacteroides (p = 0.007) and escherichia (p = 0.002) species than those who remained culture negative. furthermore, this group had a significantly higher abundance of phascolarctobacterium (p = 0.017) and streptococcus (p = 0.034) sequences than the campylobacter-negative group, which had an overrepresentation of clostridiales (p = 0.017), unclassified lachnospiraceae (p = 0.008), and anaerovorax (p = 0.015) sequences. intraindividual comparisons of the fecal microbiota compositions yielded small differences over time in campylobacter-negative participants, but significant long-term changes were found in the campylobacter-positive group (p < 0.005). the results suggest that the abundance of specific genera in the microbiota reduces resistance to campylobacter colonization in humans and that campylobacter infection can have long-term effects on the composition of the human fecal microbiota. importance: studies using mouse models have made important contributions to our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in resistance to bacterial enteropathogen colonization. the relative abundances of escherichia coli and bacteroides species have been pointed out as important determinants of susceptibility to gram-negative pathogens in general and campylobacter infection in particular. in this study, we assessed the role of the human gut microbiota in resistance to campylobacter colonization by studying abattoir workers that are heavily exposed to these bacteria. individuals with a certain composition of the gut microbiota became culture positive for campylobacter. as their microbiotas were characterized by high abundances of bacteroides spp. and e. coli, well in line with the findings with mouse models, these bacterial species likely play an important role in colonization resistance  also in humans.

TI  == metaproteomics analysis reveals the adaptation process for the chicken gut microbiota.
AB  == the animal gastrointestinal tract houses a large microbial community, the gut microbiota, that confers many benefits to its host, such as protection from pathogens and provision of essential metabolites. metagenomic approaches have defined the chicken fecal microbiota in other studies, but here, we wished to assess the correlation between the metagenome and the bacterial proteome in order to better understand the healthy chicken gut microbiota. here, we performed high-throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons and metaproteomics analysis of fecal samples to determine microbial gut composition and protein expression. 16 rrna gene sequencing analysis identified clostridiales, bacteroidaceae, and lactobacillaceae species as the most abundant species in the gut. for metaproteomics analysis, peptides were generated by using the fasp method and subsequently fractionated by strong anion exchanges. metaproteomics analysis identified 3,673 proteins. among the most frequently identified proteins, 380 proteins belonged to lactobacillus spp., 155 belonged to clostridium spp., and 66 belonged to streptococcus spp. the most frequently identified proteins were heat  shock chaperones, including 349 groel proteins, from many bacterial species, whereas the most abundant enzymes were pyruvate kinases, as judged by the number  of peptides identified per protein (spectral counting). gene ontology and kegg pathway analyses revealed the functions and locations of the identified proteins. the findings of both metaproteomics and 16s rrna sequencing analyses are discussed.

TI  == bacterial communities in manures of piglets and adult pigs bred with different feeds revealed by 16s rdna 454 pyrosequencing.
AB  == pyrosequencing-based analysis was used to characterize and compare bacterial communities in manure samples of piglets (gspm) and adult pigs (gbpm) bred with green feeds without additives, and piglets (aspm) and adult pigs (abpm) bred with synthetic feeds containing additives. for each sample, 5,010 effective sequences  were selected and utilized to do the bacterial composition analysis, respectively. in total, 1,489, 1,327, 941, and 883 operational taxonomic units were obtained at 5 % distance cutoff in gbpm, gspm, abpm, and aspm, respectively. bacterial phylotype richness in gbpm was higher than the other samples, and aspm  had the least richness. the most dominant class in the four samples is bacteroidia. approximately 41 % sequences in gbpm were affiliated with the clostridiales order. campylobacter, clostridium and streptococcus genera containing pathogenic bacteria were detected in the four samples. bacterial diversity and abundance in swine manures varied with piglets, adult pigs, and feeds. in the four samples, higher bacterial diversity but less potentially pathogenic bacterial genera in manures of adult pigs bred with green feeds were found, which indicated that those manures were more suitable for resource utilization. this study also provides evidence for the reasonableness of pig farming with green feeds.

TI  == shedding light on the microbial community of the macropod foregut using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing.
AB  == twenty macropods from five locations in queensland, australia, grazing on a variety of native pastures were surveyed and the bacterial community of the foregut was examined using 454-amplicon pyrosequencing. specifically, the v3/v4 region of 16s rrna gene was examined. a total of 5040 otus were identified in the data set (post filtering). thirty-two otus were identified as 'shared' otus (i.e. present in all samples) belonging to either firmicutes or bacteroidetes (clostridiales/bacteroidales). these phyla predominated the general microbial community in all macropods. genera represented within the shared otus included: unclassified ruminococcaceae, unclassified lachnospiraceae, unclassified clostridiales, peptococcus sp. coprococcus spp., streptococcus spp., blautia sp., ruminoccocus sp., eubacterium sp., dorea sp., oscillospira sp. and butyrivibrio sp. the composition of the bacterial community of the foregut samples of each the host species (macropus rufus, macropus giganteus and macropus robustus) was significantly different allowing differentiation between the host species based on alpha and beta diversity measures. specifically, eleven dominant otus that separated the three host species were identified and classified as: unclassified  ruminococcaceae, unclassified bacteroidales, prevotella spp. and a syntrophococcus sucromutans. putative reductive acetogens and fibrolytic bacteria were also identified in samples. future work will investigate the presence and role of fibrolytics and acetogens in these ecosystems. ideally, the isolation and characterization of these organisms will be used for enhanced feed efficiency in  cattle, methane mitigation and potentially for other industries such as the biofuel industry.

TI  == pyrosequencing of 16s rrna genes in fecal samples reveals high diversity of hindgut microflora in horses and potential links to chronic laminitis.
AB  == background: the nutrition and health of horses is closely tied to their gastrointestinal microflora. gut bacteria break down plant structural carbohydrates and produce volatile fatty acids, which are a major source of energy for horses. bacterial communities are also essential for maintaining gut homeostasis and have been hypothesized to contribute to various diseases including laminitis. we performed pyrosequencing of 16s rrna bacterial genes isolated from fecal material to characterize hindgut bacterial communities in healthy horses and those with chronic laminitis. results: fecal samples were collected from 10 normal horses and 8 horses with chronic laminitis. genomic dna  was extracted and the v4-v5 segment of the 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced on the 454 platform generating a mean of 2,425 reads per sample after quality trimming. the bacterial communities were dominated by firmicutes (69.21%  control, 56.72% laminitis) and verrucomicrobia (18.13% control, 27.63% laminitis), followed by bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, and spirochaetes. we observed more otus per individual in the laminitis group than the control group (419.6 and 355.2, respectively, p = 0.019) along with a difference in the abundance of two unassigned clostridiales genera (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01). the most abundant bacteria were streptococcus spp., clostridium spp., and treponema spp.; along with unassigned genera from subdivision 5 of verrucomicrobia, ruminococcaceae, and clostridiaceae, which together constituted ~ 80% of all otus. there was a high level of individual variation across all taxonomic ranks.  conclusions: our exploration of the equine fecal microflora revealed higher bacterial diversity in horses with chronic laminitis and identification of two clostridiales genera that differed in abundance from control horses. there was large individual variation in bacterial communities that was not explained in our study. the core hindgut microflora was dominated by streptococcus spp., several cellulytic genera, and a large proportion of uncharacterized otus that warrant further investigation regarding their function. our data provide a foundation for future investigations of hindgut bacterial factors that may influence the development and progression of chronic laminitis.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.

TI  == use of 16s ribosomal rna gene analyses to characterize the bacterial signature associated with poor oral health in west virginia.
AB  == background: west virginia has the worst oral health in the united states, but the reasons for this are unclear. this pilot study explored the etiology of this disparity using culture-independent analyses to identify bacterial species associated with oral disease. methods: bacteria in subgingival plaque samples from twelve participants in two independent west virginia dental-related studies  were characterized using 16s rrna gene sequencing and human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. unifrac analysis was used to characterize phylogenetic differences between bacterial communities obtained from plaque of participants with low or high oral disease, which was further evaluated using clustering and principal coordinate analysis. results: statistically different bacterial signatures (p<0.001) were identified in subgingival plaque of individuals with low or high oral disease in west virginia based on 16s rrna gene sequencing. low disease contained a high frequency of veillonella and streptococcus, with a moderate number of capnocytophaga. high disease exhibited substantially increased bacterial diversity and included a large proportion of clostridiales cluster bacteria (selenomonas, eubacterium, dialister). phylogenetic trees constructed using 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed that clostridiales were repeated colonizers in plaque associated with high oral disease, providing evidence that the oral environment is somehow influencing the  bacterial signature linked to disease. conclusions: culture-independent analyses  identified an atypical bacterial signature associated with high oral disease in west virginians and provided evidence that the oral environment influenced this signature. both findings provide insight into the etiology of the oral disparity  in west virginia.

TI  == high temporal and inter-individual variation detected in the human ileal microbiota.
AB  == the diversity and temporal stability of the predominant bacteria in the human ileum was studied with the use of ileal effluent samples of seven individuals with brooke ileostomies. the total number of bacteria within the ileal effluent was in the range of 10(7) -10(8) bacteria per gram (wet weight). the diversity of the bacteria in the ileal effluent showed marked differences compared with that in faecal samples from age-matched healthy adults. the ileal effluent had a higher relative abundance of species within the orders lactobacillales and clostridiales, mainly streptococcus bovis-related species, and the veillonella group, and a lower proportion of species related to ruminococcus gnavus, r. obeum and bacteroides plebeius. in addition, inter-individual differences were found, indicative of a highly personal ileal microbiota profile. furthermore, temporal profiles showed large fluctuations per individual over a period of 9-28 days (average similarity over a period of 9 days was as low as 44%), and differences between morning and afternoon profiles were observed. parallel cloning and sequencing efforts revealed several phylotypes that were not identified in previous studies (12 out of 65 phylotypes showed less than 97% sequence similarity with previously reported sequences). achaea were found to be below detection limit by quantitative pcr. overall, the results indicate that the microbiota of the human ileum is relatively unstable, less complex and consisting of different dominating phylotypes when compared with the colonic microbiota.

TI  == comparison of the cecal microbiota of domestic and wild turkeys.
AB  == the extent to which production methods alter intestinal microbial communities of  livestock is currently unknown. as the intestinal microbiota may affect animal health, nutrition, and food safety, a baseline comparison of the cecal communities of domestic and wild turkeys was performed. oligonucleotide fingerprinting of ribosomal rna (rrna) genes (ofrg) of 2,990 16s rrna clones and  dot blot quantification of dominant populations were used to identify the dominant bacterial taxa. seventy-three percent of all the clones belonged to as yet uncultured genera. however, at a higher phylogenetic level, the ofrg library  was composed of 54% bacteroidetes clones (52% of the domestic library clones, 56% of the wild library clones), 30% firmicutes clones (33% of the domestic library clones, 32% of the wild library clones), 3% proteobacteria clones (5% domestic, 2% wild), and 3% deferribacteres clones (4% domestic, 1% wild). seven percent of  the clones were unidentifiable (6% domestic, 9% wild). bacteroidetes clones included the genera alistipes, prevotella, megamonas, and bacteroides. of the clostridiales clones, groups iv, ix, and xiv including genera faecalibacterium, megasphaera, phascolarctobacterium, and papillibacter were predominant. lactobacillus, enterococcus, and streptococcus bacilli were also identified. beta- delta- and gamma-proteobacterial genera included acinetobacter, sutterella, and escherichia. deferribacteres clones showed high similarity to mucispirillum schaedleri. statistical comparison of the domestic and wild turkey clone libraries indicated similar levels of community richness and evenness despite the fact that the two libraries shared only 30% of the total clone operational taxonomic units. together these results indicate that although high level taxonomic community structure is similar, high-density turkey production causes considerable divergence of the genera found in the ceca of commercial birds from  those of their wild counterparts.
