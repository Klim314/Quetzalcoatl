TI  - Recombination between Streptococcus suis ICESsu32457 and Streptococcus agalactiae ICESa2603 yields a hybrid ICE transferable to Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that reside in the chromosome but retain the ability to undergo excision and to transfer by conjugation. Genes involved in drug resistance, virulence, or niche adaptation are often found among backbone genes as cargo DNA. We recently characterized in Streptococcus suis an ICE (ICESsu32457) carrying resistance genes [tet(O/W/32/O), tet(40), erm(B), aphA, and aadE] in the 15K unstable genetic element, which is flanked by two approximately 1.3kb direct repeats. Remarkably, approximately 1.3-kb sequences are conserved in ICESa2603 of Streptococcus agalactiae 2603V/R, which carry heavy metal resistance genes cadC/cadA and mer. In matings between S. suis 32457 (donor) and S. agalactiae 2603V/R (recipient), transconjugants were obtained. PCR experiments, PFGE, and sequence analysis of transconjugants demonstrated a tandem array between ICESsu32457 and ICESa2603. Matings between tandem array-containing S. agalactiae 2603V/R (donor) and Streptococcus pyogenes RF12 (recipient) yielded a single transconjugant containing a hybrid ICE, here named ICESa2603/ICESsu32457. The hybrid formed by recombination of the left approximately 1.3-kb sequence of ICESsu32457 and the approximately 1.3-kb sequence of ICESa2603. Interestingly, the hybrid ICE was transferable between S. pyogenes strains, thus demonstrating that it behaves as a conventional ICE. These findings suggest that both tandem arrays and hybrid ICEs may contribute to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in streptococci, creating novel mobile elements capable of disseminating new combinations of antibiotic resistance genes.
TI  - Surrogate analysis of vancomycin to predict susceptible categorization of dalbavancin.
AB  - Dalbavancin (DAL) represents a recently approved addition for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). Newly released antimicrobial agents are rarely found on commercial susceptibility testing devices, and surrogate testing may be an option for clinical microbiology laboratories. A total of 33,688 Staphylococcus aureus, 2800 viridans group streptococci (VGS), and 5722 beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) were included in this cross-susceptibility (DAL versus vancomycin [VAN]) analysis as well as 4576 coagulase-negative staphylococci and 6515 enterococci (nonindicated species groups). Isolates were collected as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program for the United States (USA) and Europe (2011-2013). Susceptibility testing followed CLSI (M07-A9 and M100-S24) methods. USA Food and Drug Administration (DAL) and CLSI (VAN) breakpoint criteria were used for correlations between DAL and VAN susceptibility results. A categorical agreement (CA; susceptible) rate of 99.9% was observed between DAL and VAN when testing S. aureus. Only 48 (0.14%) very major (false-susceptible) errors were noted against VAN-susceptible isolates that displayed a DAL-nonsusceptible (MIC, 0.25 or 0.5mug/mL) phenotype. When susceptible MIC correlations were analyzed against indicated BHS species (Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes), an overall CA rate of 97.7-100.0% was obtained. Complete (100.0%) CA was documented for S. pyogenes, as well as against all VGS isolates, including the indicated Streptococcus anginosus group (758 strains). In conclusion, high susceptible CA rates between DAL and VAN were observed when testing a contemporary collection of indicated clinical isolates found in ABSSSI. VAN-susceptible isolates can be inferred to be inhibited by DAL (97.7-100.0%) at the regulatory agency-approved susceptible interpretive breakpoint of </=0.12mug/mL.
TI  - Reduction of Lactobacillus in the milks of cows with subclinical mastitis.
AB  - Clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis are the most frequent diseases encountered on dairy farms worldwide, which cause significant economic loss and veterinary cost. The mastitic disease status is associated with increases in both milk bacterial pathogens and somatic cell count (SCC). Although it is well established that the mastitic pathogens generally correlate with the milk SCC, to our knowledge, the correlation between the probiotic genus, Lactobacillus, and the mastitic causative bacteria and SCC have not been determined previously. Thus, in this study, milk samples from 12 mild and 28 severe subclinical mastitic dairy cows were collected from the same farm. The overall milk bacterial load was quantified with the total plate count method. The Lactobacillus genus and 4 common clinical and subclinical mastitic pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Trueperella pyogenes) in the sampled milk were enumerated by quantitative PCR. Mild and severe subclinical mastitic samples were distinctly separated on the principal component analysis score plot generated based on the quantities of these 5 target bacteria, suggesting that clear differences existed in the microbiological composition between the two sample groups. Based on comparison with the pairwise Mann-Whitney test, the mild subclinical mastitic dairy cows had a significantly higher amounts of lactobacilli (P=0.0175), but lower E. coli (P=0.0002), S. aureus (P<0.0001), S. agalactiae (P=0.0001) and T. pyogenes (P=0.0044) quantities, while an opposite trend occurred in the severe subclinical mastitic group. The negative correlation between Lactobacillus and the pathogenic bacteria, as well as the SCC, was confirmed with Spearman correlation analysis. Data generated from the current study may hint to a close relationship between Lactobacillus and the health of bovine udder.
TI  - Transduction of the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage Phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(A) and tet(O), to other Streptococcus species.
AB  - Phim46.1 - Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(A) and tet(O), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (M phenotype) and tetracycline - is widespread in S. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. Phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among S. pyogenes isolates, but no information is available about its transferability to other Streptococcus species. We thus investigated Phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of different Streptococcus species. Transductants were obtained from recipients of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus suis. Retransfer was always achieved, and from S. suis to S. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. In transductants Phim46.1 retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin C, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. The transductants shared the same Phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved RNA uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. No transfer occurred to recipients of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. A largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. Growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of Phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in S. suis. The S. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene atl.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) grown in R. Macedonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (EOB) or leaves (EOL) of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. Essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (GC/FID/MS) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: EOB yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for EOL. Two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in EOB and 33.83% in EOL), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in EOB and 28.52-29.49% in EOL), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene and alpha-thujene. The most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of EOB was Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 31 mul/ml). EOL have showed high activity towards: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 125 mul/ml). The pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium spp. and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC >50%). The sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemopilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (MIC >50%). No activity was observed toward Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: The analysis of EOB and EOL revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the Macedonian Juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of Pinus peuce (Pinaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (T+N) and from twigs without needles (T-N) from wild Pinus peuce Griseb. (Pinaceae), from three different locations in R. Macedonia, were investigated. Essential oil yields of T+N ranged from 7.5 mL/kg to 12.5 mL/kg and for T-N from 13.8 mL/kg to 17.3 mL/kg. GC/FID/MS analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the T+N and T-N oils, respectively. The major components in T+N and T-N oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene D (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). Antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and one strain of Candida albicans. T-N essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans as well as Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimicrobial activity of T+N essential oils was greater, especially against Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Enterococcus and Candida albicans, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125 muL/mL. Summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of Pinus peuce T+N and T-N essential oils collected from different localities in R. Macedonia varied considerably. These alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (T+N or T-N).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AZD0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against Gram-positive, fastidious Gram-Negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  - AZD0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious Gram-negative (Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (Legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (Clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. AZD0914 works via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. AZD0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken DNA under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved DNA to form fused circular DNA. Whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. AZD0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in S. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrB. Additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for AZD0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. AZD0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. In in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. The potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of AZD0914 support its continued development.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in European and US hospitals (2010-13).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) in European and US hospitals. METHODS: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for SSTIs were included. Isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in Europe (Israel included) and the USA, respectively, between 2010 and 2013. RESULTS: Oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal MIC, MIC50 and MIC90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus. CoNS from the USA (MIC50, 0.015 mg/L) demonstrated an MIC50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from Europe (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L). Overall, vancomycin-resistant (VanA-phenotype) Enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (MIC50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/L; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all VanA E. faecalis at </=0.5 mg/L. Equivalent oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/L) were noted for all VanB and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, while higher MICs (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L) were obtained for VanA strains. Oritavancin had low MICs against the overall populations of Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/L; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the Streptococcus anginosus group (MIC50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher MICs for Streptococcus dysgalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/L; >/=98.3% susceptible). CONCLUSIONS: Oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of European and US isolates causing SSTIs. These results describe oritavancin activity against Gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the USA.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for ABSSSI and CABP; and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant Gram-positive organisms and select Gram-negative pathogens. The pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. Ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. There is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been published in a small series of case reports. Randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.
TI  - The salivary scavenger and agglutinin in early life: diverse roles in amniotic fluid and in the infant intestine.
AB  - The salivary scavenger and agglutinin (SALSA), also known as gp340 and dmbt1, is  an antimicrobial and inflammation-regulating molecule located at the mucosal surfaces. The present study revealed that SALSA was present in the amniotic fluid (AF) and exceptionally enriched in both meconium and feces of infants. Based on immunological and mass spectrometric analysis, SALSA was estimated to constitute up to 4-10% of the total protein amount in meconium, making it one of the most abundant proteins. SALSA proteins in the AF and intestinal samples were polymorphic and exhibited varying polypeptide compositions. In particular, a different abundance of peptides corresponding to functionally important structures was found in the AF and intestinal SALSA. The AF form of SALSA had a more intact structure and contained peptides from the zona pellucida domain, which is involved in cell differentiation and oligomerization. In contrast, the intestinal SALSA was more enriched with the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains. The AF, but not the meconium SALSA, bound to Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. gordonii, and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, differential binding was observed also to known endogenous ligands C1q, mannose-binding lectin, and secretory IgA. Our results have thus identified mucosal body compartments, where SALSA is particularly abundant, and suggest that SALSA exhibits varying functions in the different mucosal locations. The high levels of SALSA in AF and the infant intestine suggest a robust and important function for SALSA during the fetal development and in the mucosal innate immune defense of infants.
TI  - In vitro activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive pathogens isolated in Canadian hospital laboratories from 2011 to 2013.
AB  - Gram-positive pathogens isolated in 15 Canadian hospital laboratories between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility to oritavancin and comparative antimicrobial agents using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method. Oritavancin demonstrated in vitro activity equivalent to, or more potent than, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline against the isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=1460; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 99.7% oritavancin-susceptible), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n=427; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 99.5% oritavancin-susceptible), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=132; oritavancin MIC90, 0.25 mug/mL; 99.2% oritavancin-susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=156; oritavancin MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL; 100% oritavancin-susceptible), and Enterococcus faecalis (n=304; oritavancin MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL; 98.7% oritavancin-susceptible) tested.
TI  - In vitro selection of mutants resistant to ozenoxacin compared with levofloxacin  and ciprofloxacin in Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of selecting mutants resistant to ozenoxacin, a des-fluoro-(6)-quinolone active against pathogens involved in skin and skin structure infections, compared with levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in quinolone-susceptible and -resistant Gram-positive cocci. METHODS: Forty-nine quinolone-susceptible and -resistant Gram-positive cocci strains with different profiles of mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) were examined to determine the frequency of selecting mutants resistant to ozenoxacin compared with levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. MICs and mutations in the QRDR were determined by standard broth microdilution and PCR amplification and sequencing, respectively. RESULTS: The mean resistance rates were 3.8 x 10(-9) (range <9 x 10(-11)-1 x 10(-8)) for ozenoxacin, 9.7 x 10(-9) (range <1.1 x 10(-11)-4.2 x 10(-8)) for levofloxacin and 1.2 x 10(-8) (range <1.6 x 10(-10)-2.6 x 10(-7)) for ciprofloxacin. Spontaneous mutants resistant to ozenoxacin showed lower MICs (</= 16 mg/L) than mutants resistant to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin (</= 512 mg/L). Additional mutations were observed only in ParC at Ser-80 in Staphylococcus spp., Ser-79 in Streptococcus agalactiae and Asp-83 and Ser-89 in Streptococcus pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of ozenoxacin selecting spontaneous resistant mutants in quinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains with pre-existing mutations in the QRDR is low, supporting the potential utility of ozenoxacin as a therapeutic alternative in the treatment of skin infections caused by strains highly resistant to quinolones.
TI  - Construction of a chimeric lysin Ply187N-V12C with extended lytic activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - Developing chimeric lysins with a wide lytic spectrum would be important for treating some infections caused by multiple pathogenic bacteria. In the present work, a novel chimeric lysin (Ply187N-V12C) was constructed by fusing the catalytic domain (Ply187N) of the bacteriophage lysin Ply187 with the cell binding domain (146-314aa, V12C) of the lysin PlyV12. The results showed that the chimeric lysin Ply187N-V12C had not only lytic activity similar to Ply187N against staphylococcal strains but also extended its lytic activity to streptococci and enterococci, such as Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, which Ply187N could not lyse. Our work demonstrated that generating novel chimeric lysins with an extended lytic spectrum was feasible through fusing a catalytic domain with a cell-binding domain from lysins with lytic spectra across multiple genera.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of ICESde3396 between three beta-hemolytic streptococcal species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that possess all genes necessary for excision, transfer and integration into recipient genome. They also carry accessory genes that impart new phenotypic features to recipient strains. ICEs therefore play an important role in genomic plasticity and population structure. We previously characterised ICESde3396, the first ICE identified in the beta-hemolytic Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp equisimilis (SDSE) and demonstrated its transfer to single isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus, GBS). While molecular studies found the ICE in multiple SDSE and GBS isolates, it was absent in all GAS isolates examined. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that ICESde3396:km is transferable from SDSE to multiple SDSE, GAS and GBS isolates. However not all strains of these species were successful recipients under the same growth conditions. To address the role that host factors may have in conjugation we also undertook conjugation experiments in the presence of A549 epithelial cells and DMEM. While Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) occurred, conjugation efficiencies were no greater than when similar experiments were conducted in DMEM. Additionally transfer to GAS NS235 was successful in the presence of DMEM but not in Todd Hewitt Broth suggesting that nutritional factors may also influence HGT. The GAS and GBS transconjugants produced in this study are also able to act as donors of the ICE. CONCLUSION: We conclude that ICEs are major sources of interspecies HGT between beta-hemolytic streptococci, and by introducing accessory genes imparting novel phenotypic characteristics, have the potential to alter the population structure of these species.
TI  - [Species and quantitative characteristics of pharyngeal mucosa microflora in pregnant women].
AB  - AIM: Species and quantitative characteristics of upper respiratory tract (URT) mucosa microflora in women at gestation period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results of a bacteriological study of 68 samples of mucus from posterior pharyngeal wall in women at gestation period (from 14 weeks), 52 of those--from pregnant women with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms and 16--from women without signs of disease, are presented. Qualitative and quantitative composition of microflora was studied by a generally accepted bacteriological method. RESULTS: During primary bacteriological study 111 microorganism cultures were isolated. 88 (79.3%) of strains belonged to Gram-positive flora, 20 (18.0%)--to Gram-negative, and Candida genus fungi constituted 3 (2.7%) isolates. Streptococcus pyogenes and Moraxella catarrhalis were isolated from pregnant women with ARI signs at 23.1% and 5.8% frequency of occurrence, respectively. A higher detectability of Staphylococcus aureus--in 31.3% and Candida spp.--in 6.3% of women who did not complain as opposed to patients with URT lesions (in 21.2 and 3.9%, respectively) was determined. In patients without ARI signs the amount of bacteria did not exceed 10(5)--10(6) CFU/ml, in pregnant women with ARI diagnosis in 8 of 52 cases semination of pharyngeal mucuswas observed--10(7)--10(8) CFU/ml. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans in composition of pharyngeal mucus microflora of pregnant women both with URT lesion signs and without them was shown, however the degree of semination by pathogens in the groups was different that determined the severity of disease manifestations.
TI  - Subterfuge and sabotage: evasion of host innate defenses by invasive gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The development of a severe invasive bacterial infection in an otherwise healthy  individual is one of the most striking and fascinating aspects of human medicine. A small cadre of gram-positive pathogens of the genera Streptococcus and Staphylococcus stand out for their unique invasive disease potential and sophisticated ability to counteract the multifaceted components of human innate defense. This review illustrates how these leading human disease agents evade host complement deposition and activation, impede phagocyte recruitment and activation, resist the microbicidal activities of host antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, escape neutrophil extracellular traps, and promote and accelerate phagocyte cell death through the action of pore-forming cytolysins. Understanding the molecular basis of bacterial innate immune resistance can open new avenues for therapeutic intervention geared to disabling specific virulence factors and resensitizing the pathogen to host innate immune clearance.
TI  - Establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Final rule.
AB  - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. This final rule implements a provision of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). GAIN is intended to encourage development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. Based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, FDA has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' Acinetobacter species, Aspergillus species, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Campylobacter species, Candida species, Clostridium difficile, Coccidioides species, Cryptococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae), Enterococcus species, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and Vibrio cholerae. The preamble to the proposed rule described the factors the Agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. As described in the preamble of this final rule, FDA applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity tested against contemporary Latin American bacterial pathogens (2011).
AB  - A total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 Latin American medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. Isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 30.0% of isolates were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. Ceftaroline was active against Staphylococcus aureus (42.8% MRSA) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/L and all isolates at </= 2 mg/L (MIC5090, 0.25/2mg/L). National MRSA rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in Colombia to a high of 68.1% in Chile. All Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/L for both). All Streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for all S. pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin MIC, 4 mg/L) strains. All Haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. For the Latin American region, the ESBL-phenotype rate was 37.6% for Escherichia coli and 53.3% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ceftaroline was not active against ESBL-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-ESBL-phenotype. The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from Latin America indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the Latin American region.
TI  - Cardiopulmonary morbidity of streptococcal infections in a PICU.
AB  - AIM: The streptococci are important bacteria that cause serious childhood infections. We investigated cardiopulmonary morbidity associated with streptococcal infection and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. METHODS: A retrospective study between 2002 and 2013 of all children with a laboratory isolation of streptococcus. RESULTS: There were 40 (2.3%) PICU patients with streptococcal isolations including Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus, GAS, n = 7), Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B streptococcus, GBS, n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP, n = 20), alpha-hemolytic (n = 4), beta-hemolytic (n = 2) and gama-hemolytic (n = 2) streptococci. Comparing among GAS, GBS and SP, respiratory isolates were more likely positive for GAS or SP (P = 0.033), whereas cerebrospinal fluid was more likely positive for GBS (P = 0.002). All GAS and GBS, and the majority of SP (90%) were sensitive to penicillin. All SP specimens were sensitive to cefotaxime and vancomycin. These infections were associated with high PICU mortality of 43%, 20% and 25%, respectively. Isolation of streptococci was associated with a 30% mortality and high rates of need for mechanical ventilatory and inotropic supports. Patients with GAS, SP or any streptococcal isolation had relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI), P value] of PICU deaths of 7.5 (CI 3.1-18.1, P < 0.0001), 4.5 (CI 2.0-9.8, P < 0.0002) and 5.7 (CI 3.4-9.5, P < 0.0001), respectively. In SP, older children had significantly higher prevalence of premorbid conditions such as malignancy, mental retardation/cerebral palsy +/- seizure disorders, chromosomal or genetic disorders (P = 0.003) than children <5 years of age. Serotypes were available for some of these specimens that included 19A, 6B, 3 and 6C. There were four SP deaths with multiorgan system failure and hemolytic uremic syndrome (two 19A and two serotype 3). CONCLUSIONS: Severe streptococcal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite treatment with systemic antibiotics and intensive care unit support. GAS and SP affect the lungs of children, whereas GBS more likely causes meningitis in infants. The expanded coverage of newer polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines can probably prevent infections by serotypes 19A, 19F, 6B and 3.
TI  - Influence of pathogenic bacteria species present in the postpartum bovine uterus  on proteome profiles.
AB  - In the first 2-3 weeks after parturition >90% of dairy cows will have some form of uterine infection. Uterine contamination with pathogens, such as Trueperella (formerly Arcanobacterium) pyogenes increases the risk of developing more severe endometritis, which can reduce conception rates. In this study, we compared the uterine proteome of cows infected with Trueperella pyogenes with that of uninfected cows, using 2D gel electrophoresis, and identified annexins A1 and A2 (ANXA1 and ANXA2), apolipoprotein A-1, calprotectin (S100A9), cathelicidin, enolase 1 (ENO1), peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1), phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), serine dehydratase (SDS) and serine protease inhibitors (SERPIN) B1, B3 and B4 proteins as differing in abundance in endometritis. Subsequently, levels of ten of these proteins were monitored in uterine samples collected from a herd of lactating, dairy cows at 15 and 42 days post-partum (DPP). The levels were compared with the cytology scores of the samples and the bacterial species isolated from the uterus. Cathelicidin, PGLYRP1, SERPINB1 and S100A9 levels at 15DPP showed strong positive correlations (r=0.78, 0.80, 0.79, and 0.68 respectively; P<0.001) with % of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). When compared with other bacterial pathogens identified, Streptococcus agalactiae and Truperella pyogenes induced increased expression of the indicator proteins, suggesting that these organisms may adversely affect the subsequent ability of the cow to conceive. Interestingly, there was no difference in the proportion of cows pregnant at 6 and 17 weeks after start of mating between the cows with high or low %PMN.
TI  - Streptococcus zooepidemicus and Streptococcus equi evolution: the role of CRISPRs.
AB  - The host-restricted bacterium Streptococcus equi is the causative agent of equine strangles, the most frequently diagnosed infectious disease of horses worldwide. The disease is characterized by abscessation of the lymph nodes of the head and neck, leading to significant welfare and economic cost. S. equi is believed to have evolved from an ancestral strain of Streptococcus zooepidemicus, an opportunistic pathogen of horses and other animals. Comparison of the genome of S. equi strain 4047 with those of S. zooepidemicus identified examples of gene loss due to mutation and deletion, and gene gain through the acquisition of mobile genetic elements that have probably shaped the pathogenic specialization of S. equi. In particular, deletion of the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) locus in the ancestor of S. equi may have predisposed the bacterium to acquire and incorporate new genetic material into its genome. These include four prophages and a novel integrative conjugative element. The virulence cargo carried by these mobile genetic elements is believed to have shaped the ability of S. equi to cause strangles. Further sequencing of S. zooepidemicus has highlighted the diversity of this opportunistic pathogen. Again, CRISPRs are postulated to influence evolution, balancing the need for gene gain over genome stability. Analysis of spacer sequences suggest that these pathogens may be susceptible to a limited range of phages and provide further evidence of cross-species exchange of genetic material among Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae.

TI  - Genetic diversity and virulence properties of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis from different sources.
AB  - A recent increase in virulence of pathogenic Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE) has been widely proposed. Such an increase may be partly explained by the acquisition of new virulence traits by horizontal gene transfer from related streptococci such as Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) and Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS). A collection of 54 SDSE strains isolated in Italy in the years 2000-2010 from different sources (paediatric throat carriage, invasive and non-invasive diseases) was characterized by emm typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. The virulence repertoire was evaluated by PCR for the presence of GAS superantigen (spe) genes, the streptolysin S (sagA) gene, the group G fibronectin-binding protein (gfbA) gene and GAS-GBS alpha-like protein family (alp) genes; moreover, the ability to invade human epithelial cells was investigated. Resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin and clindamycin was assessed. The combined use of emm typing and PFGE proved to be a reliable strategy for the epidemiological analysis of SDSE isolates. The most frequent emm types were the same as those more frequently reported in other studies, thus indicating the diffusion of a limited number of a few successful emm types fit to disseminate in humans. The speG gene was detected in SDSE strains of different genetic backgrounds. Erythromycin resistance determined by the erm(T) gene, and the unusual, foggy MLSB phenotype, observed in one and seven strains, respectively, have never previously, to our knowledge, been reported in SDSE. Moreover, a new member of the alp family was identified. The identification of new antibiotic and virulence determinants, despite the small size of the sample analysed, shows the importance of constant attention to monitoring the extent of lateral gene transfer in this emerging pathogen.
TI  - New non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  - Hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. World health organization (WHO) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. In this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. The new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (PCA) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (CS) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MR S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant S. epidermidis (MDR S. epidermidis), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and three clinical isolates: MR S. aureus, MDR S. epidermidis, and an E. coli strain. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) indices were evaluated. Ethanol 70% V/V, isopropanol 60% V/V, and 4% w/V chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. Copper sulphate pentahydrate was very effective against all tested microorganisms: The MIC and MBC for CS ranged from 781 mg/l against S. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against E. coli strains and C. albicans. In addition, PCA exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae. The combination of CS and PCA showed a strong synergistic effect and all FIC indices were </=0.500. The combination of CS and PCA were more effective than ethanol 70% V/V and isopropanol 60% V/V. In addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. This work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Long-Term Evaluation of Corneal Preservation Media Against Microorganisms Using A Closed-Chamber Study Model.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the existence of in vitro long-term antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS against microorganisms related to corneal infection using a closed-chamber study model. METHODS: Optisol-GS was contaminated with microorganisms related to corneal infections, and different times after contamination was analyzed using a closed-chamber study model. Microbial growths were analyzed by macroscopic observation. RESULTS: For Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days and 14 days after contamination occurred. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans, microbial growth was observed in all samples studied. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 72 hours after contamination. For Streptococcus pyogenes, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days after contamination. For Escherichia coli, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 48 hours after contamination occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no in vitro antimicrobial effect for any microorganism analyzed was observed in contaminated Optisol-GS after 72 hours; however, effective antimicrobial activity was observed for S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli after 7 to 10 days.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - [Beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia in adults].
AB  - The serogroups A (Streptococcus pyogenes), B (Streptococcus agalactiae) and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (group C and G) are generally defined as beta-hemolytic streptococci. Beta-hemolytic streptococci cause a variety of infections ranging from skin and soft-tissue infections to severe invasive infections such as necrotizing fasciitis (NF) and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). The case fatality rate due to bacteremias caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci is 15%. The use of clindamycin in combination with benzylpenicillin has been shown to be of benefit. The use of intravenous immunoglobulin is suggested in STSS in combination with antibiotics and surgery.
TI  - Menaquinone analogs inhibit growth of bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria cause serious human illnesses through combinations of cell surface and secreted virulence factors. We initiated studies with four of these organisms to develop novel topical antibacterial agents that interfere with growth and exotoxin production, focusing on menaquinone analogs. Menadione, 1,4-naphthoquinone, and coenzymes Q1 to Q3 but not menaquinone, phylloquinone, or coenzyme Q10 inhibited the growth and to a greater extent exotoxin production of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae at concentrations of 10 to 200 mug/ml. Coenzyme Q1 reduced the ability of S. aureus to cause toxic shock syndrome in a rabbit model, inhibited the growth of four Gram-negative bacteria, and synergized with another antimicrobial agent, glycerol monolaurate, to inhibit S. aureus growth. The staphylococcal two-component system SrrA/B was shown to be an antibacterial target of coenzyme Q1. We hypothesize that menaquinone analogs both induce toxic reactive oxygen species and affect bacterial plasma membranes and biosynthetic machinery to interfere with two-component systems, respiration, and macromolecular synthesis. These compounds represent a novel class of potential topical therapeutic agents.
TI  - Prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a French paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  - The epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (OAI) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. We conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric OAI in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). All children suspected of community acquired OAI were included and followed-up for 3 years. The etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. All osteoarticular (OA) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. Real-time universal 16S rRNA and PCR targeted on Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. From 17 March 2007 to 26 February 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. A portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. C reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. PCR increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. Among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and OAI samples), there were 63% documented OAI. The main pathogens found were K. kingae (52%), S. aureus (28%), S. pyogenes (7%), S. pneumoniae (3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). All isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. PCR has significantly improved the performance and the delay of IOA diagnosis in children, for which K. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. The probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric OAI.
TI  - Streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis: multiple faces of the same disease.
AB  - The role of Streptococcus species as an aetiological microorganism of vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is considered to be of little relevance. We aimed to describe a large number of cases of streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis (SVO), to analyze the clinical features associated with different Streptococcus species, and to compare them with a cohort of patients with VO caused by Staphylococcus aureus. An incidence study and a retrospective, multicenter, observational clinical study of cases of SVO (1991-2011) were performed. Statistical comparison of SVO by different species and between them and staphylococcal VO was carried out. Over the whole period there was an increasing incidence in the number of VOs and SVOs per year (p <0.05). Among 58 cases of SVO, those caused by non-viridans streptococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes; n = 26) mimicked VO by S. aureus, and presented with more fever, neurological symptoms and paravertebral abscesses in comparison with those caused by the viridans group (remaining species). In contrast, the latter have a sub-acute clinical picture and were associated with the presence of endocarditis (p <0.05). Among non-viridans SVOs, concomitant infection was specifically related to S. pneumoniae (p <0.05). In conclusion, SVO presents a wide range of clinical patterns. The relationship between VO and diagnosis of endocarditis was established with SVO caused by the viridans group. Whereas non-viridans SVO mimics acute characteristics of VO caused by S. aureus, cases of viridans SVO are significantly more likely to have a sub-acute clinical presentation. The increased incidence of SVO during the last decades could support a new epidemiological scenario.
TI  - SecA localization and SecA-dependent secretion occurs at new division septa in group B Streptococcus.
AB  - Exported proteins of Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), which include proteins localized to the bacterial surface or secreted into the extracellular environment, are key players for commensal and pathogenic interactions in the mammalian host. These proteins are transported across the cytoplasmic membrane via the general SecA secretory pathway and those containing the so-called LPXTG sorting motif are covalently attached to the peptidoglycan by sortase A. How SecA, sortase A, and LPXTG proteins are spatially distributed in GBS is not known. In the close relative Streptococcus pyogenes, it was shown that presence of the YSIRKG/S motif (literally YSIRKX3Gx2S) in the signal peptide (SP) constitutes the targeting information for secretion at the septum. Here, using conventional and deconvolution immunofluorescence analyses, we have studied in GBS strain NEM316 the localization of SecA, SrtA, and the secreted protein Bsp whose signal peptide contains a canonical YSIRKG/S motif (YSLRKykfGlaS). Replacing the SP of Bsp with four other SPs containing or not the YSIRKG/S motif did not alter the localized secretion of Bsp at the equatorial ring. Our results indicate that secretion and cell wall-anchoring machineries are localized at the division septum. Cell wall- anchored proteins displayed polar (PilB, Gbs0791), punctuate (CspA) or uniform distribution (Alp2) on the bacterial surface. De novo secretion of Gbs0791 following trypsin treatment indicates that it is secreted at the septum, then redistributed along the lateral sides, and finally accumulated to the poles. We conclude that the +/-YSIRK SP rule driving compartimentalized secretion is not true in S. agalactiae.
TI  - Identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. Depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target DNA/RNA. In the current study, the applicability of FISH was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. To remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to FISH, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. FISH was performed using oligonucleotides specific for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes. The enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of FISH were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) CFU/ml or higher. However, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) CFU/ml were not detectable in all cases. The ability of FISH to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

TI  - Endocarditis in adults with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocarditis may precede or complicate bacterial meningitis, but the  incidence and impact of endocarditis in bacterial meningitis are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with meningitis and endocarditis from a nationwide cohort study of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2012. Endocarditis was identified in 24 of 1025 episodes (2%) of bacterial meningitis. Cultures yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae in 13 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius in 1 patient each. Clues leading to the diagnosis of endocarditis were cardiac murmurs, persistent or recurrent fever, a history of heart valve disease, and S aureus as the causative pathogen of bacterial meningitis. Treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy in all patients and surgical valve replacement in 10 patients (42%). Two patients were treated with oral anticoagulants, and both developed life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage. Systemic (70%) and neurological (54%) complications occurred frequently, leading to a high proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome (63%). Seven of 24 patients (29%) with meningitis and endocarditis died. CONCLUSIONS: Endocarditis is an uncommon coexisting condition in bacterial meningitis but is associated with a high rate of unfavorable outcome.
TI  - Novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GrAS]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases. They are among the many Gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. As a result, alternative therapies need to be developed to combat these pathogens. We have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (PlySs2), derived from a Streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), Streptococcus suis, Listeria, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), S. pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguinis, group G streptococci (GGS), group E streptococci (GES), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. PlySs2 has an N-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain and a C-terminal SH3b binding domain. It is stable at 50 degrees C for 30 min, 37 degrees C for >24 h, 4 degrees C for 15 days, and -80 degrees C for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. PlySs2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced MRSA and S. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a MIC of 16 mug/ml for MRSA. A single, 2-mg dose of PlySs2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice in a bacteremia model of mixed MRSA and S. pyogenes infection. Serially increasing exposure of MRSA and S. pyogenes to PlySs2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to PlySs2 and resistance to mupirocin. To date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, PlySs2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.
TI  - Characterization and genome sequencing of a novel bacteriophage infecting Streptococcus agalactiae with high similarity to a phage from Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A novel bacteriophage, JX01, specifically infecting bovine Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from milk of mastitis-affected cattle. The phage morphology showed that JX01 belongs to the family Siphoviridae, and this phage demonstrated a broad host range. Microbiological characterization demonstrated that nearly 90 % of JX01 phage particles were adsorbed after 2.5 min of incubation, that the burst size was 20 virions released per infected host cell, and that there was a latent period of 30 min. JX01 was thermal sensitive and showed acid and alkaline resistance (pH 3-11). The genome of JX01 was found to consist of a linear, double-stranded 43,028-bp DNA molecule with a GC content of 36.81 % and 70 putative open reading frames (ORFs) plus one tRNA. Comparative genome analysis revealed high similarity between JX01 and the prophage 315.2 of Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Contemporary potencies of minocycline and tetracycline HCL tested against Gram-positive pathogens: SENTRY Program results using CLSI and EUCAST breakpoint criteria.
AB  - Tetracycline class agents vary widely in their activity against emerging important antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter spp. Also, published susceptibility breakpoints are discordant between the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), and regulatory-approved documents. We have assessed the impact of these differences for tetracycline HCL and minocycline when tested against contemporary Gram-positive pathogens. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011) compared minocycline and tetracycline HCL activity via reference methods (M07-A9) using a worldwide collection of S. aureus (SA; 4917 strains with 1955 MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN; 1899), S. pyogenes (GRA; 246), and S. agalactiae (GRB; 217). Regardless of applied categorical breakpoints, minocycline exhibited wider coverage (% susceptible) than tetracycline HCL of 4.5-11.8/0.5-2.6/1.4-2.3/0.4-0.4% for MRSA/SPN/GRB/GRA, respectively. Lower EUCAST susceptible breakpoints produced reduced susceptibility rates for minocycline ranging from no difference (</=0.5 mug/mL) for GRA to -8.9% (</=1 mug/mL) for MRSA (97.2% susceptible by CLSI; 88.3% by EUCAST). Use of tetracycline HCL-susceptible results to predict minocycline susceptibility was very accurate (99.0-100.0%), with absolute categorical agreement rates ranging from 92.1% to 98.4% (CLSI) to 98.4% to 99.6% (EUCAST) for streptococci; greatest predictive error was noted using the CLSI breakpoints (14.7%) compared to EUCAST criteria (only 5.0%; acceptable), both for MRSA testing dominated by false-resistant results for minocycline. In conclusion, minocycline demonstrates continued superior in vitro activity compared to tetracycline HCL when testing SA (especially MRSA) and pathogenic streptococci. When testing tetracyclines, laboratories must recognize the expanded spectrum of minocycline against certain pathogens and utilize methods minimizing interpretive error. We conclude that EUCAST breakpoint criteria (</=0.5 or </=1 mug/mL) represent the most conservative (better recognize strains with tet resistance mechanisms) and accurate tetracycline breakpoint guidelines for testing contemporary isolates of Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Inducible clindamycin resistance in beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to macrolides in beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae arises primarily due to Erm(B) or Mef(A). Erm(B) typically confers high level resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B (MLSB phenotype), whereas Mef(A) confers low level resistance to macrolides only (M phenotype). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of macrolide resistance mechanisms in isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci in Israel, with particular emphasis on inducible MLSB phenotype. METHODS: We collected 316 clinical isolates of streptococci during May-August 2010. Erythromycin resistance mechanism was determined by the erythromycin-clindamycin double disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Erythromycin and clindamycin resistance rates were 19.4% and 13.4% for S. pneumoniae, 4.7% and 1.6% for group A Streptococcus (GAS), 17% and 17% for group B Streptococcus (GBS), and 38.8% and 27.8% for group G Streptococcus (GGS) respectively. The most common resistance mechanism for all streptococci was constitutive MLSB (cMLSB). Inducible MLSs (iMLSB) mechanism was found in 3% of all strains and represented 25% of resistance mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of macrolide resistance and the distribution of resistance mechanisms differ among beta-hemolytic streptococci and S. pneumoniae, with GBS, GGS and S. pneumoniae showing the highest resistance rate. Macrolide or lincosamide cannot be empirically used for severe streptococcal infections before strains are proved to be susceptible. Continuous surveillance of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance patterns among streptococci is needed.
TI  - Update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the USA: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011).
AB  - Dalbavancin (DAL) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. DAL potency was assessed in the 2011 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9 US Census regions. Monitored Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus (SA; 1,036/50.4% MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 115), Enterococcus faecalis (25), E. faecium (31), Streptococcus pyogenes (155), Streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (VGS; 40). All susceptibility (S) testing used Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. DAL (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/mL) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (DAP) and vancomycin (VAN), respectively against SA, with MSSA and MRSA having the same MIC(90) results. CoNS was slightly more DAL-S (MIC(50), </=0.03mug/mL). The highest staphylococcal DAL MIC was only 0.25 mug/mL. beta-Haemolytic streptococci (betaHS) and VGS had DAL MIC results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/mL (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL), and only enterococci showed elevated DAL MIC results. VanA phenotype-resistant E. faecalis or E. faecium had DAL MIC values at >/=1 mug/mL; VanB strains were DAL-S (MIC, </=0.25 mug/mL). All cited DAL quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of MIC creep. In conclusion, year 2011 SENTRY Program data for DAL documents sustained potent activity against SA, CoNS, betaHS, VGS, and VAN-S enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than VAN, DAP, or linezolid.
TI  - Conjugative transfer and cis-mobilization of a genomic island by an integrative and conjugative element of Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Putative integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), i.e., genomic islands which could excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate into the chromosome of the bacterial host strain, were previously identified by in silico analysis in the sequenced genomes of Streptococcus agalactiae (M. Brochet et al., J. Bacteriol. 190:6913-6917, 2008). We investigated here the mobility of the elements integrated into the 3' end of a tRNA(Lys) gene. Three of the four putative ICEs tested were found to excise but only one (ICE_515_tRNA(Lys)) was found to transfer by conjugation not only to S. agalactiae strains but also to a Streptococcus pyogenes strain. Transfer was observed even if recipient cell already carries a related resident ICE or a genomic island flanked by attL and attR recombination sites but devoid of conjugation or recombination genes (CIs-Mobilizable Element [CIME]). The incoming ICE preferentially integrates into the 3' end of the tRNA(Lys) gene (i.e., the attR site of the resident element), leading to a CIME-ICE structure. Transfer of the whole composite element CIME-ICE was obtained, showing that the CIME is mobilizable in cis by the ICE. Therefore, genomic islands carrying putative virulence genes but lacking the mobility gene can be mobilized by a related ICE after site-specific accretion.
TI  - Common regulators of virulence in streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcal species are a diverse group of bacteria which can be found in animals and humans. Their interactions with host organisms can vary from commensal to pathogenic. Many of the pathogenic species are causative agents of severe, invasive infections in their hosts, accounting for a high burden of morbidity and mortality, associated with high economic costs in industry and health care. Among them, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis are discussed here. An environmentally stimulated and tightly controlled expression of their virulence factors is of utmost importance for their pathogenic potential. Thus, the most universal and widespread regulators from the classes of stand-alone transcriptional regulators, two-component signal transduction systems (TCS), eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases, and small noncoding RNAs are the topic of this chapter. The regulatory levels are reviewed with respect to function, activity, and their role in pathogenesis. Understanding of and interfering with transcriptional regulation mechanisms and networks is a promising basis for the development of novel anti-infective therapies.
TI  - [Clinical course of acute respiratory infection and the state of microbiocenosis  of upper respiratory tract in pregnant women].
AB  - AIM: Evaluate clinical features of the course of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and the state of microbiocenosis of nasopharynx of pregnant women at gestational term of 14 - 26 weeks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the stage of outpatient therapy of ARI 49 pregnant women at the gestational term of 14 - 26 weeks were examined: group 1--27 individuals consulting at day 1 and receiving Viferon (gel) intranasally for 10 days, group 2--22 individuals consulting at day 2 - 3 and receiving Viferon (gel and suppositorium). Respiratory viral infection was diagnosed by multiplex PCR. Bacteriologic study of discharge from the middle section of the pharynx was performed by the standard technique. RESULTS: ARI in group 1 of pregnant women were regarded as mild severity and persisted for an average of 3 days. In group 2 in 13 (59%) of patients ARI of moderate severity was noted and the recovery occurred at day 6. Pyo-inflammatory diseases of ENT organs appeared in 10 (45.4%) of patients. Respiratory infections were determined in 16 (32.7%) of them: coronaviruses--in 5 (10.2%), rhinoviruses--in 3 (6.2%), respiratory syncytial viruses--in 6 (12.3%), parainfluenza (type 2) and influenza A viruses--1 (2%) both, without significant differences between the observed groups. Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Corynebacterium spp., Streptococcus pyogenes with the predominance of the latter in 36.7% and 60% of cases, respectively, in pregnant women of the group 2 (p < 0.01), were detected in the microflora of the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx. CONCLUSION: Viferon preparation therapy prescribed at day 1 of outpatient visit of pregnant women may promote mild course o fARI and prophylaxis of complications of upper respiratory tract.
TI  - Prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a French paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect ABSTRACT: The epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (OAI) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. We conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric OAI in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). All children suspected of community acquired OAI were included and followed-up for 3 years. The etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. All osteoarticular (OA) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. Real-time universal 16S rRNA and PCR targeted on Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. From 17 March 2007 to 26 February 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. A portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases, including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. C reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. PCR increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. Among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and OAI samples), there were 63% documented OAI. The main pathogens found were K. kingae (52%), S. aureus (28%), S. pyogenes (7%), S. pneumoniae (3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (2%). All isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. PCR has significantly improved the performance and the delay of IOA diagnosis in children, for which K. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. The probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric OAI.
TI  - Interim susceptibility testing for ceftaroline, a new MRSA-active cephalosporin:  selecting potent surrogate beta-lactam markers to predict ceftaroline activity against clinically indicated species.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the United States Food and Drug Administration in October 2010. In over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility. An alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the USA. Very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at </= 8 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing S. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone MIC at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/mL (susceptible category) when testing Haemophilus influenzae. Only when testing indicated Enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). These presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.
TI  - Interspecies mobilization of an ermT-carrying plasmid of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis by a coresident ICE of the ICESa2603 family.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The recently documented presence of almost identical, small, non-self-transmissible, erm(T)-carrying plasmids in clonally unrelated erythromycin-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae suggests that these plasmids somehow circulate in the streptococcal population. The objective of this study was to characterize the erm(T)-carrying genetic element in a clinical isolate of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (Sde5580) and to provide a possible explanation for the spread of erm(T)-carrying plasmids in streptococci. METHODS: The erm(T)-carrying element of Sde5580 was investigated by plasmid analysis, PCR experiments and sequencing. Transfer and retransfer experiments were performed using S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and Streptococcus suis strains as recipients and by selection in the presence of suitable drug concentrations. Transconjugants were analysed by SmaI-macrorestriction analysis. Genetic studies also included PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using HindIII endonuclease. RESULTS: Sde5580 contained two mobile genetic elements: a 4950 bp erm(T)-carrying plasmid (p5580) almost identical to the non-self-transmissible erm(T)-carrying plasmids of S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae mentioned above, and an ~63 kb cadC/cadA-carrying integrative and conjugative element (ICESde3396-like) of the ICESa2603 family. p5580 was transferable at high frequency to the recipients of all three species through in trans mobilization by the coresident ICESde3396-like element. p5580 and ICESde3396-like were able to be transferred either separately or together. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence of horizontal transfer of an erm(T)-carrying plasmid between streptococci. In trans mobilization by coresident ICEs may be one mechanism for the spread of erm(T)-carrying plasmids in the streptococcal population.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci collected from western European countries in 2011.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the activity of oritavancin against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and beta-haemolytic streptococci recently isolated from acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections or bacteraemia in western Europe. METHODS: Forty-one centres in Spain (8), Italy (9), Germany (8), France (8) and the UK (8) submitted 866 isolates [204 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 177 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), 101 VRE, 193 Streptococcus agalactiae and 191 Streptococcus pyogenes] that were collected during the first 6 months of 2011. These were re-identified and susceptibilities to oritavancin and comparators were determined. RESULTS: Oritavancin was very active against MRSA (MIC(50)/MIC(90) 0.03/0.06 mg/L), MRCoNS (0.06/0.12 mg/L), VRE (0.03/0.06 mg/L), S. agalactiae (0.03/0.06 mg/L) and S. pyogenes (0.06/0.25 mg/L). The highest oritavancin MIC observed was 0.25 mg/L (species were S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis). CONCLUSIONS: These data from recently collected Gram-positive bacteria in western Europe confirm the potent in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide range of resistant MRSA, MRCoNS and VRE isolates, including ones resistant to newer agents.
TI  - Developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology.
AB  - Vaccines have a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology in the era of genomics is taking advantage of new technologies to tackle diseases for which vaccine development has so far been unsuccessful. Almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. However, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. As such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'Reverse Vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. Furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery, including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. Vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. The process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic Escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. As novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach.
TI  - Chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1957, Tunisia introduced 117 species of Eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. Actually, Eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. A few investigations were reported on the biological activities of Eucalyptus oils worldwide. In Tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. At that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. METHODS: The essential oils of eight Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman, Korbous (North East Tunisia) and Souinet arboreta (North of Tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. RESULTS: Twenty five components were identified by GC/FID and GC/MS. These components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. The chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. According to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % I, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to Eucalyptus oils. The cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within Eucalyptus species oils. CONCLUSIONS: E. odorata showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. In addition, E. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. However, the best antiviral activity appeared with E. bicostata. Virus pretreatment with E. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (IC(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, SI = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (IC(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, SI = 3.33). The essential oil of E. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. This activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.
TI  - Characterization of a Streptococcus suis tet(O/W/32/O)-carrying element transferable to major streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - Mosaic tetracycline resistance determinants are a recently discovered class of hybrids of ribosomal protection tet genes. They may show different patterns of mosaicism, but their final size has remained unaltered. Initially thought to be confined to a small group of anaerobic bacteria, mosaic tet genes were then found to be widespread. In the genus Streptococcus, a mosaic tet gene [tet(O/W/32/O)] was first discovered in Streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant pig and human pathogen. In this study, we report the molecular characterization of a tet(O/W/32/O) gene-carrying mobile element from an S. suis isolate. tet(O/W/32/O) was detected, in tandem with tet(40), in a circular 14,741-bp genetic element (39.1% G+C; 17 open reading frames [ORFs] identified). The novel element, which we designated 15K, also carried the macrolide resistance determinant erm(B) and an aminoglycoside resistance four-gene cluster including aadE (streptomycin) and aphA (kanamycin). 15K appeared to be an unstable genetic element that, in the absence of recombinases, is capable of undergoing spontaneous excision under standard growth conditions. In the integrated form, 15K was found inside a 54,879-bp integrative and conjugative element (ICE) (50.5% G+C; 55 ORFs), which we designated ICESsu32457. An approximately 1.3-kb segment that apparently served as the att site for excision of the unstable 15K element was identified. The novel ICE was transferable at high frequency to recipients from pathogenic Streptococcus species (S. suis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae), suggesting that the multiresistance 15K element can successfully spread within streptococcal populations.
TI  - Gene repertoire evolution of Streptococcus pyogenes inferred from phylogenomic analysis with Streptococcus canis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae.
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes, is an important human pathogen classified within the pyogenic group of streptococci, exclusively adapted to the human host. Our goal was to employ a comparative evolutionary approach to better understand the genomic events concomitant with S. pyogenes human adaptation. As part of ascertaining these events, we sequenced the genome of one of the potential sister species, the agricultural pathogen S. canis, and combined it in a comparative genomics reconciliation analysis with two other closely related species, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus equi, to determine the genes that were gained and lost during S. pyogenes evolution. Genome wide phylogenetic analyses involving 15 Streptococcus species provided convincing support for a clade of S. equi, S. pyogenes, S. dysgalactiae, and S. canis and suggested that the most likely S. pyogenes sister species was S. dysgalactiae. The reconciliation analysis identified 113 genes that were gained on the lineage leading to S. pyogenes. Almost half (46%) of these gained genes were phage associated and 14 showed significant matches to experimentally verified bacteria virulence factors. Subsequent to the origin of S. pyogenes, over half of the phage associated genes were involved in 90 different LGT events, mostly involving different strains of S. pyogenes, but with a high proportion involving the horse specific pathogen S. equi subsp. equi, with the directionality almost exclusively (86%) in the S. pyogenes to S. equi direction. Streptococcus agalactiae appears to have played an important role in the evolution of S. pyogenes with a high proportion of LGTs originating from this species. Overall the analysis suggests that S. pyogenes adaptation to the human host was achieved in part by (i) the integration of new virulence factors (e.g. speB, and the sal locus) and (ii) the construction of new regulation networks (e.g. rgg, and to some extent speB).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  - AIMS: This work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in Braganca, against several clinical isolates obtained in Hospital Center of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro, Portugal. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). MIC results showed that Russula delica and Fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited the growth of gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Morganella morganni and Pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. A bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae and Strep. pyogenes with MBC of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. Lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon Past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited Proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). Ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against Enterococcus faecalis and L. monocytogenes, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. agalactiae (MBCs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and Strep. pyogenes (MBC 10 mg ml(-)(1)). Leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of E. coli and Pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for Past. multocida, Strep. pyogenes and Strep. agalactiae. CONCLUSIONS: Fistulina hepatica, R. botrytis and R. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.
TI  - Cutaneous vulvar streptococcal infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the etiology of fine superficial fissures in women with vulvar pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The charts of women with vulvar complaints seen in the Mucosal Disorders Clinic at Northwestern University between April 2006 and May 2008 were reviewed. Outcome measures included mucocutaneous examination findings and results of microbiological swab cultures in the presence of fine, superficial, vulvar and/or perianal fissures. The presence of concomitant vulvar disorders was noted. RESULTS: Sixteen women who presented with vulvar pain were found to have fine, superficial, vulvar and/or perianal fissures with minimal or no erythema on examination. None had inflammatory vaginitis. Group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae) was recovered in 6 (37.5%) patients. All women with group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus-positive cultures had a concomitant vulvar disorder; however, fissures were present despite appropriate treatment directed at the concomitant vulvar dermatosis. Three patients reported improvement in vulvar pain after treatment with antibiotics, and fissures had resolved by the time of follow-up examination in these 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus may cause painful fine superficial fissures and minimal erythema of vulvar skin. Obtaining microbiological cultures should be considered in the evaluation of vulvar pain even in the absence of purulent inflammatory vaginitis. The search for documentation and treatment of this relevant pathogen is a departure from published recommendations.
TI  - Subtractive genomics approach to identify putative drug targets and identification of drug-like molecules for beta subunit of DNA polymerase III in Streptococcus species.
AB  - The prolonged use of the antibiotics over the years has transformed many organisms resistant to multiple drugs. This has made the field of drug discovery of vital importance in curing various infections and diseases. The drugs act by binding to a specific target protein of prime importance for the cell's survival. Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes are the few gram positive organisms that have developed resistance to drugs. It causes pneumonia, meningitis, pharyngitis, otitis media, sinusitis, bacteremia, pericarditis, and arthritis infections. The present study was carried out to identify potential drug targets and inhibitors for beta subunit of DNA polymerase III in these three Streptococcus species that might facilitate the discovery of novel drugs in near future. Various steps were adopted to find out novel drug targets. And finally 3D structure of DNA polymerase III subunit beta was modeled. The ligand library was generated from various databases to find the most suitable ligands. All the ligands were docked using Molegro Virtual Docker and the lead molecules were investigated for ADME and toxicity.
TI  - Identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - The design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. In order to identify potentially conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic DNA from Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from Staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. By comparison with previous screening data from Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. In particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the N-terminal domain of SACOL0609 (SdrD), the C-terminal domain of SACOL0723 (ScaB) and the C-terminus of SACOL1140 (IsdA) from Staph. aureus. The three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. The antisera were also able to opsonize both Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. The conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.
TI  - The CovS/CovR acid response regulator is required for intracellular survival of group B Streptococcus in macrophages.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal meningitis and septicemia. The ability of this organism to survive inside phagocytic cells is poorly understood but thought to be an important step for the establishment of disease in the host. Here, we demonstrate that GBS shows prolonged survival within J774 macrophages and that the capacity to survive is not significantly changed across a diverse range of strains representing different serotypes, multilocus sequence types (MLST), and sites of clinical isolation. Using staining for the lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) and by pharmacological inhibition of phagosome acidification, we demonstrate that streptococci reside in a phagosome and that acidification of the phagosome is required for GBS to survive intracellularly. Moreover, we show that the GBS two-component system CovS/CovR, which is the major acid response regulator in this organism, is required for survival inside the phagosome.
TI  - Streptococcus suis, an Emerging Drug-Resistant Animal and Human Pathogen.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, has been receiving growing attention not only for its role in severe and increasingly reported infections in humans, but also for its involvement in drug resistance. Recent studies and the analysis of sequenced genomes have been providing important insights into the S. suis resistome, and have resulted in the identification of resistance determinants for tetracyclines, macrolides, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, antifolate drugs, streptothricin, and cadmium salts. Resistance gene-carrying genetic elements described so far include integrative and conjugative elements, transposons, genomic islands, phages, and chimeric elements. Some of these elements are similar to those reported in major streptococcal pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae and share the same chromosomal insertion sites. The available information strongly suggests that S. suis is an important antibiotic resistance reservoir that can contribute to the spread of resistance genes to the above-mentioned streptococci. S. suis is thus a paradigmatic example of possible intersections between animal and human resistomes.
TI  - Structure of plantaricin locus of Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3 is a strain which is well known on the Russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. The strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. L. plantarum 8P-A3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. DNA sequence analysis of L. plantarum 8P-A3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins EF and NC8. The plantaricin locus found in L. plantarum 8P-A3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in L. plantarum J51.
TI  - Surveillance of JNJ-Q2 activity tested against Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci as a component of the 2010 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - JNJ-Q2 is a novel broad-spectrum bactericidal fluorinated 4-quinolone with potent activity against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens with a balanced potency against both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV targets. JNJ-Q2 is in clinical development for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. With the use of reference broth microdilution methods in a central reference laboratory design, MIC values were obtained for 3650 pathogens (44.4% were from patients diagnosed with ABSSSI) obtained during the 2010 SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program. Isolates were collected from patients in 96 medical centers in 26 countries in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. JNJ-Q2 demonstrated good activity overall (MIC(50/90), 0.015/0.5 mug/mL) and against 3081 Staphylococcus aureus with >95% of the isolates inhibited at a MIC of </=0.5 mug/mL; against 1410 levofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates, >90% were inhibited by MIC </=0.5 mug/mL. All isolates were inhibited at a MIC of </=2 mug/mL. In addition, JNJ-Q2 demonstrated excellent activity (MIC(90), 0.015 mug/mL) against 569 isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci (including 278 Streptococcus pyogenes and 161 Streptococcus agalactiae). JNJ-Q2 was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested overall and against all pathogens when compared directly to moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16S rDNA sequences.
AB  - Accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. Here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) of 16S rDNA sequences. Real-time PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragment, spanning the variable region V5 and V6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. First, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. Six of the isolates, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Corynebacterium bovis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. Four of the type strains, E. coli, S. agalactiae, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. Secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of A. pyogenes, E. coli, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, K. pneumoniae, S. uberis and S. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. Based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the HRMA. Next, the HRMA was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. The three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. Overall accuracy of the validation assay was 95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity observed in the PCR amplicons of S. uberis. The present study revealed that broad-range real-time PCR with HRMA can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.
TI  - Structural differences between the Streptococcus agalactiae housekeeping and pilus-specific sortases: SrtA and SrtC1.
AB  - The assembly of pili on the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria requires transpeptidase enzymes called sortases. In Streptococcus agalactiae, the PI-1 pilus island of strain 2603V/R encodes two pilus-specific sortases (SrtC1 and SrtC2) and three pilins (GBS80, GBS52 and GBS104). Although either pilus-specific sortase is sufficient for the polymerization of the major pilin, GBS80, incorporation of the minor pilins GBS52 and GBS104 into the pilus structure requires SrtC1 and SrtC2, respectively. The S. agalactiae housekeeping sortase, SrtA, whose gene is present at a different location and does not catalyze pilus polymerization, was shown to be involved in cell wall anchoring of pilus polymers. To understand the structural basis of sortases involved in such diverse functions, we determined the crystal structures of S. agalactiae SrtC1 and SrtA. Both enzymes are made of an eight-stranded beta-barrel core with variations in their active site architecture. SrtA exhibits a catalytic triad arrangement similar to that in Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA but different from that in Staphylococcus aureus SrtA. In contrast, the SrtC1 enzyme contains an N-terminal helical domain and a 'lid' in its putative active site, which is similar to that seen in Streptococcus pneumoniae pilus-specific sortases, although with subtle differences in positioning and composition. To understand the effect of such differences on substrate recognition, we have also determined the crystal structure of a SrtC1 mutant, in which the conserved DP(W/F/Y) motif was replaced with the sorting signal motif of GBS80, IPNTG. By comparing the structures of WT wild type SrtA and SrtC1 and the 'lid' mutant of SrtC1, we propose that structural elements within the active site and the lid may be important for defining the role of specific sortase in pili biogenesis.
TI  - Identification and characterization of plasmid-borne erm(T) macrolide resistance  in group B and group A Streptococcus.
AB  - One hundred and seven group B Streptococcus (GBS) isolates and 344 group A Streptococcus (GAS) isolates were collected between 2005 and 2009 from 2 area hospitals and studied for resistance to erythromycin (ERY) and clindamycin (CLI) and the presence of the erm(T) macrolide resistance gene. The erm(T) gene was found in 5 (8%) of 61 erythromycin nonsusceptible GBS isolates and in 22 (55%) of 40 erythromycin nonsusceptible GAS isolates. The erm(T) gene in all 27 GBS/GAS erm(T) gene-positive isolates was located on a plasmid. Three erm(T) gene-positive plasmids were DNA sequenced. Two plasmids (1 each from GBS and GAS isolates) were both 4967 bp in size, contained the erm(T) gene, and differed by only 2 base pairs, suggesting interspecies horizontal transfer of the erm(T) gene containing plasmid. The third (GBS) plasmid was 6825 bp in size and contained GBSi1, a group II bacterial intron, as well as the erm(T) gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of all 27 erm(T) gene containing isolates and a selection of erm(T) gene-negative isolates indicated possible clonal expansion among erm(T) gene containing GAS isolates, but not among the 5 erm(T) gene-positive GBS isolates.
TI  - [The characteristics of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from skin lesions observed in ambulatory patients and the assessment of their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - The bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections occur commonly and are characterized by more or less intensified changes within skin and subcutaneous tissue. The bacterial skin infections give rise to significant therapeutic problems associated with increasing resistance etiological agents of these infections to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of various Gram-positive microorganisms in skin lesion observed in ambulatory patients in a period from June 2005 to December 2006. There were 116 bacterial strains isolated and identified from clinical samples: Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase - negative staphylococi (S.epidermidis, S. xylosus, S.capitis, S.saccharolyticus), Propionobacterium acnes, Streptococcus spp. (S.agalactiae, S.pyogenes) i Corynebacterium spp. (C. striatum, C. amycolatum, C. aquaticum). In the further part of this study we analyzed a profile of their susceptibility to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics in relation to drugs recommended for the empirical therapy. The resultant resistance patterns among the examined bacterial isolates are indicative of certain divergence between recommended empirical antibiotic therapy and actual antimicrobial susceptibility of many etiologic factors of skin and soft-tissue infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to the macrolide antibiotics. METHODS: Inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. The data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. In general, there was less macrolide resistance in African than in Asian isolates. Most African studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most Chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. There was very little information available for Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in SSA remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against Salmonellae spp. in Asia. In urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. However, there is no information on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.
TI  - High-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. We constructed a novel vector based on the E. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pAT28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. The plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the CAMP-factor gene (cfb) promoter of Streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pBSU101. Upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by FACS-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. To assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. We successfully labeled Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the EGFP reporter plasmid pBSU101. In all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level EGFP expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.
TI  - Exploring internal features of 16S rRNA gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. The genus has been divided into different groups based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. The present study was taken up to explore 16S rRNA gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus Streptococcus. METHODS: 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to the isolates of S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, S. gallolyticus, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, S. thermophilus and S. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. RESULTS: The framework based analysis was used to segregate Streptococcus spp. previously identified upto genus level. This segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized Streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. CONCLUSIONS: The markers generated exploring 16S rRNA gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus Streptococcus.
TI  - Evaluation of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry for rapid identification of Beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the rapid identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci. We compared Bruker Biotyper 2.0 with Vitek2 coupled to the agglutination test. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of 386 beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates yielded high-confidence identification to the species level for all 386 isolates. The Vitek2 gave high-confidence identification to the species level for 88% of Streptococcus agalactiae isolates (n = 269/306), 92% of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates (n = 48/52), and 39% of isolates of Streptococcus dysgalactiae serogroups C and G (n = 11/28).
TI  - Incidence and severity of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A Streptococcus, and group B Streptococcus infections among pregnant and postpartum women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of streptococcal infection in pregnant and postpartum women is poorly described in recent literature. We used data from multistate surveillance for invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A Streptococcus (GAS), and group B Streptococcus (GBS) infections to estimate disease incidence and severity in these populations. METHODS: Cases were reported through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Active Bacterial Core surveillance, an active population- and laboratory-based system. A case was defined as illness in a woman aged 15-44 years with streptococcus isolated from a normally sterile body site during 2007-2009. Pregnant or postpartum status was recorded at the time of culture. Incidence was calculated as cases per 1000 woman-years with use of national Census data; 95% confidence intervals were calculated on the basis of lambda distribution. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore associations between pregnant or postpartum status and hospital length of stay, a marker of disease severity. RESULTS: We identified 1848 cases in women; 6.0% of women were pregnant, and 7.5% were postpartum. Pregnant women had a higher mean incidence of GBS disease, compared with nonpregnant women (0.04 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.03-0.05 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.02 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.02-0.02 cases per 1000 woman-years]). Postpartum women had elevated mean incidence of all 3 pathogens, compared with nonpregnant women (S. pneumoniae: 0.15 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.09-0.25 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.052 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.049-0.056 cases per 1000 woman-years]; GAS: 0.56 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.42-0.70 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.019 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.017-0.021 cases per 1000 woman-years]; GBS: 0.49 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.36-0.64 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.018 [range, 0.016-0.020 cases per 1000 woman-years]). Neither pregnancy nor postpartum status was associated with longer length of stay among women infected with any of the 3 pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Although invasive streptococcal infections do not appear to be more severe in pregnant or postpartum women, postpartum women have a 20-fold increased incidence of GAS and GBS, compared with nonpregnant women.
TI  - Comparative genomics and the role of lateral gene transfer in the evolution of bovine adapted Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - In addition to causing severe invasive infections in humans, Streptococcus agalactiae, or group B Streptococcus (GBS), is also a major cause of bovine mastitis. Here we provide the first genome sequence for S. agalactiae isolated from a cow diagnosed with clinical mastitis (strain FSL S3-026). Comparison to eight S. agalactiae genomes obtained from human disease isolates revealed 183 genes specific to the bovine strain. Subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening for the presence/absence of a subset of these loci in additional bovine and human strains revealed strong differentiation between the two groups (Fisher exact test: p<0.0001). The majority of the bovine strain-specific genes ( approximately 85%) clustered tightly into eight genomic islands, suggesting these genes were acquired through lateral gene transfer (LGT). This bovine GBS also contained an unusually high proportion of insertion sequences (4.3% of the total genome), suggesting frequent genomic rearrangement. Comparison to other mastitis-causing species of bacteria provided strong evidence for two cases of interspecies LGT within the shared bovine environment: bovine S. agalactiae with Streptococcus uberis (nisin U operon) and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (lactose operon). We also found evidence for LGT, involving the salivaricin operon, between the bovine S. agalactiae strain and either Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus salivarius. Our findings provide insight into mechanisms facilitating environmental adaptation and acquisition of potential virulence factors, while highlighting both the key role LGT has played in the recent evolution of the bovine S. agalactiae strain, and the importance of LGT among pathogens within a shared environment.
TI  - Domain movement within a gene: a novel evolutionary mechanism for protein diversification.
AB  - A protein function is carried out by a specific domain localized at a specific position. In the present study, we report that, within a gene, a specific amino acid sequence can move between a certain position and another position. This was discovered when the sequences of restriction-modification systems within the bacterial species Helicobacter pylori were compared. In the specificity subunit of Type I restriction-modification systems, DNA sequence recognition is mediated by target recognition domain 1 (TRD1) and TRD2. To our surprise, several sequences are shared by TRD1 and TRD2 of genes (alleles) at the same locus (chromosomal location); these domains appear to have moved between the two positions. The gene/protein organization can be represented as x-(TRD1)-y-x-(TRD2)-y, where x and y represent repeat sequences. Movement probably occurs by recombination at these flanking DNA repeats. In accordance with this hypothesis, recombination at these repeats also appears to decrease two TRDs into one TRD or increase these two TRDs to three TRDs (TRD1-TRD2-TRD2) and to allow TRD movement between genes even at different loci. Similar movement of domains between TRD1 and TRD2 was observed for the specificity subunit of a Type IIG restriction enzyme. Similar movement of domain between TRD1 and TRD2 was observed for Type I restriction-modification enzyme specificity genes in two more eubacterial species, Streptococcus pyogenes and Mycoplasma agalactiae. Lateral domain movements within a protein, which we have designated DOMO (domain movement), represent novel routes for the diversification of proteins.
TI  - Lateral gene transfer of streptococcal ICE element RD2 (region of difference 2) encoding secreted proteins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genome of serotype M28 group A Streptococcus (GAS) strain MGAS6180 contains a novel genetic element named Region of Difference 2 (RD2) that encodes seven putative secreted extracellular proteins. RD2 is present in all serotype M28 strains and strains of several other GAS serotypes associated with female urogenital infections. We show here that the GAS RD2 element is present in strain MGAS6180 both as an integrative chromosomal form and a circular extrachromosomal element. RD2-like regions were identified in publicly available genome sequences of strains representing three of the five major group B streptococcal serotypes causing human disease. Ten RD2-encoded proteins have significant similarity to proteins involved in conjugative transfer of Streptococcus thermophilus integrative chromosomal elements (ICEs). RESULTS: We transferred RD2 from GAS strain MGAS6180 (serotype M28) to serotype M1 and M4 GAS strains by filter mating. The copy number of the RD2 element was rapidly and significantly increased following treatment of strain MGAS6180 with mitomycin C, a DNA damaging agent. Using a PCR-based method, we also identified RD2-like regions in multiple group C and G strains of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp.equisimilis cultured from invasive human infections. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the data indicate that the RD2 element has disseminated by lateral gene transfer to genetically diverse strains of human-pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - A quantitative descriptive study of the prevalence of carriage (colonisation) of  haemolytic streptococci groups A, B, C and G in pregnancy.
AB  - Invasive group B streptococcus (GBS) disease is a leading cause of neonatal death. There is no UK national screening programme for GBS in pregnancy, hence colonisation rates are unknown. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis is given during labour to colonised women to reduce neonatal GBS transmission and subsequent invasive infection. Data about prevalence of other haemolytic streptococci in pregnancy, including group A streptococcus (GAS), are uncommon despite increasing importance. This study investigated colonisation in 100 pregnant women using conventional culture methods; 19% had GBS. This suggests that GBS carriage is common in the UK. The role of other beta-haemolytic streptococci remains undefined.
TI  - Streptococcus
AB  - The genus Streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. Various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. Among the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. Streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. The nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. For several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: S pyogenes (group A streptococci) and S pneumoniae (pneumococci). In 1984, two members were assigned a new genus - the group D enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became Enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and E faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). In recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. A variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. Some of the other medically important streptococci are S agalactiae (group B), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease; E faecalis (group D), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. Particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. Important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include S mutans and S sanguis (involved in dental caries), S mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "S milleri" (associated with suppurative infections in children and adults). There remains persistent taxonomic confusion regarding "S milleri." These and other streptococci of medical importance are listed inTable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.
TI  - Etiology of invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children in Korea (1996-2005): a retrospective multicenter study.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the major etiological agents responsible for invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent Korean children. We retrospectively surveyed invasive bacterial infections in immunocompetent children caused by eight major pediatric bacteria, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella species that were diagnosed at 18 university hospitals from 1996 to 2005. A total of 768 cases were identified. S. agalactiae (48.1%) and S. aureus (37.2%) were the most common pathogens in infants younger than 3 months. S. agalactiae was a common cause of meningitis (73.0%), bacteremia without localization (34.0%), and arthritis (50%) in this age group. S. pneumoniae (45.3%) and H. influenzae (20.4%) were common in children aged 3 months to 5 yr. S. pneumoniae was a common cause of meningitis (41.6%), bacteremia without localization (40.0%), and bacteremic pneumonia (74.1%) in this age group. S. aureus (50.6%), Salmonella species (16.9%), and S. pneumoniae (16.3%) were common in older children. A significant decline in H. influenzae infections over the last 10 yr was noted. S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus are important pathogens responsible for invasive bacterial infections in Korean children.
TI  - Cellular interactions by LPxTG-anchored pneumococcal adhesins and their streptococcal homologues.
AB  - In this review we focus on three important families of LPxTG-anchored adhesins in the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also their homologues in related streptococci. We discuss the contribution of these streptococcal adhesins to host tropism, pathogenesis and their interactions with different host cell types. The first surface structures discussed are the heteropolymeric pili that have been found in important streptococcal pathogens such as S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and E. faecalis/faecium. Major and minor pilus subunit proteins are covalently joined and finally attached to the cell wall through the action of specific sortases. The role of pili and individual pilin subunits in adhesion and pathogenesis and their structure and assembly in different streptococcal species are being covered. Furthermore, we address recent findings regarding a family of large glycosylated serine-rich repeat (SRR) proteins that act as fibrillar adhesins for which homologues have been found in several streptococcal species including pneumococci. In the pneumococcal genome both pili and its giant SRR protein are encoded by accessory genes present in particular clonal lineages for which epidemiological information is available. Finally, we briefly discuss the role played by the pneumococcal neuraminidase NanA in adhesion and pathogenesis.
TI  - Ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. Experimental study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. Ozone therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. Ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. Thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. The action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the Ozonytron device (made by Biozonix) on model strains of Streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all media depending on the time of action of ozone. In the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. What is more, two models of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. CONCLUSION: Research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.
TI  - Autocatalytic intramolecular isopeptide bond formation in gram-positive bacterial pili: a QM/MM simulation.
AB  - Many gram-positive pathogens possess external pili or fimbriae with which they adhere to host cells during the infection process. Unusual dual intramolecular isopeptide bonds between Asn and Lys side chains within the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the pilus subunits have been observed initially in the Streptococcus pyogenes pilin subunit Spy0128 and subsequently in GBS52 from Streptococcus agalactiae, in the BcpA major pilin of Bacillus cereus and in the RrgB pilin of Streptococcus pneumoniae, among others. Within each pilin subunit, intramolecular isopeptide bonds serve to stabilize the protein. These bonds provide a means to withstand large external mechanical forces, as well as possibly assisting in supporting a conformation favored for pilin subunit polymerization via sortase transpeptidases. Genome-wide analyses of pili-containing gram-positive bacteria are known or suspected to contain isopeptide bonds in pilin subunits. For the autocatalytic formation of isopeptide cross-links, a conservation of three amino acids including Asn, Lys, and a catalytically important acidic Glu (or Asp) residue are responsible. However, the chemical mechanism of how isopeptide bonds form within pilin remains poorly understood. Although it is possible that several mechanistic paths could lead to isopeptide bond formation in pili, the requirement of a conserved glutamate and highly organized positioning of residues within the hydrophobic environment of the active site were found in numerous pilin crystal structures such as Spy0128 and RrgB. This suggests a mechanism involving direct coupling of lysine side chain amine to the asparagine carboxamide mediated by critical acid/base or hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalytic glutamate residue. From this mechanistic perspective, we used the QM/MM minimum free-energy path method to examine the reaction details of forming the isopeptide bonds with Spy0128 as a model pilin, specifically focusing on the role of the glutamate in catalysis. It was determined that the reaction mechanism likely consists of two major steps: the nucleophilic attack on Cgamma by nitrogen in the unprotonated Lys epsilon-amino group and, then two concerted proton transfers occur during the formation of the intramolecular isopeptide bond to subsequently release ammonia. More importantly, within the dual active sites of Spy0128, Glu(117), and Glu(258) residues function as crucial catalysts for each isopeptide bond formation, respectively, by relaying two proton transfers. This work also suggests that domain-domain interactions within Spy0128 may modulate the reactivity of residues within each active site. Our results may hopefully shed light on the molecular mechanisms of pilin biogenesis in gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of E-101 Solution, a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: E-101 Solution (E-101) is a novel myeloperoxidase-mediated antimicrobial. It is composed of porcine myeloperoxidase (pMPO), glucose oxidase, glucose as the substrate and specific amino acids in an aqueous vehicle. E-101 is being developed for topical application directly into surgical wounds to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). The in vitro activity of E-101 was investigated. METHODS: MIC, MBC, time-kill and antimicrobial combination experiments were performed according to CLSI guidelines with modifications. Resistance selection studies were performed using a serial passage method. RESULTS: E-101 showed MIC(90) values of 0.03, 0.5 and 0.5 mg pMPO/L for staphylococci (n = 140), streptococci (n = 95) and enterococci (n = 55), respectively. MIC(90) values ranged between 0.03-0.5 and </= 0.004-0.12 mg pMPO/L for Enterobacteriaceae (n = 148) and Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae (n = 92) strains, respectively. There was no antimicrobial tolerance to E-101 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus pyogenes. Time-kill studies demonstrated a rapid (<30 min) bactericidal effect against S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. There was no evidence of stable resistance to E-101 among staphylococci, enterococci, E. coli or P. aeruginosa strains and no evidence of E-101 interaction with antibiotics commonly used in clinical medicine. Conclusions E-101 shows potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity against bacteria that are the causative pathogens of SSIs, thereby providing the impetus to test its clinical utility in the prevention of SSIs.
TI  - Genomic organization, structure, regulation and pathogenic role of pilus constituents in major pathogenic Streptococci and Enterococci.
AB  - Oligocomponent pilus structures, recently discovered in many important Gram-positive pathogens, represent a new class of virulence factors with adhesive and matrix protein-binding activity. Some of these proteins have emerged as very promising lead components of protein-based vaccines against Streptococci. These extended surface structures play key roles in host cell and tissue adherence, paracellular translocation, and biofilm formation of major Gram-positive pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae as well as in opportunistic and nosocomial pathogens like Enterococci. Here, we discuss the similarities and differences of: (1) the genomic organization of the various regions encoding pilus proteins, (2) the number, type, and assembly of the proteins constituting the pili, (3) their expression and regulation mechanisms, (4) their role in bacterial virulence, and (5) their potential as vaccine candidate antigens.
TI  - Bacteraemia caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci in North Queensland: changing  trends over a 14-year period.
AB  - Group A streptococci (GAS) are usually the predominant species in cases of bacteraemia caused by beta haemolytic streptococci (BHS). An increasing worldwide incidence of invasive disease from non-group A BHS has been reported. Little is known about the changing trends in invasive disease caused by BHS in Australia. North Queensland has a relatively large indigenous population, who experience significantly higher rates of group A-related disease than the non-indigenous population. This prospective study examined changing trends of disease from large colony BHS that group with A, B, C and G antisera over a 14-year period at the single large tertiary referral hospital in the area. We identified 392 bacteraemic episodes caused by BHS. GAS were most commonly isolated (49%), with adjusted rates remaining stable over the period. There was a significant increase in the incidence of non-neonatal bacteraemia caused by group B streptococci (GBS) over the study period (r = 0.58; p 0.030), largely driven by infection in older, non-indigenous women. Rates of bacteraemia caused by group C streptococci also experienced a modest, but significant, increase over time (r = 0.67; p 0.009). GAS, which had no predominant emm type, were seen most commonly in indigenous subjects (52%). Mortality rates ranged from 3.2% (group G) to 10.3% (group C), with a rate of 7.9% associated with group A disease. The marked rise in GBS disease has been noted worldwide, but the relatively low incidence in indigenous Australian patients has not been described before, despite the burden of well-recognized risk factors for GBS disease within this group.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. The present study provides direct evidence of MPO binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. The microbicidal effectiveness of H(2)O(2) and of OCl(-) was compared to that of MPO plus H(2)O(2). Synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining Streptococcus sanguinis, a H(2)O(2)-producing microbe showing low MPO binding, with high-MPO-binding Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous H(2)O(2), with and without MPO, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]). Selectivity of MPO microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the MPO MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for 82 bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. Both H(2)O(2) and OCl(-) destroyed RBCs at submicrobicidal concentrations. Nanomolar concentrations of MPO increased H(2)O(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. Streptococci plus MPO produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and RBCs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. MPO directly killed H(2)O(2)-producing S. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-H(2)O(2)-producing E. faecalis. The MPO MICs and MBCs for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were significantly lower than those for E. faecalis. The streptococcal studies showed much higher MIC/MBC results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. E. faecalis MPO binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. Selective MPO binding results in selective killing.
TI  - Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of bacteremic pneumonia among US adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined associations between the socioeconomic characteristics of census tracts and racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia among US adults. METHODS: We analyzed data on 4870 adults aged 18 years or older with community-acquired bacteremic pneumonia identified through active, population-based surveillance in 9 states and geocoded to census tract of residence. We used data from the 2000 US Census to calculate incidence by age, race/ethnicity, and census tract characteristics and Poisson regression to estimate rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: During 2003 to 2004, the average annual incidence of bacteremic pneumonia was 24.2 episodes per 100 000 Black adults versus 10.1 per 100 000 White adults (RR = 2.40; 95% CI = 2.24, 2.57). Incidence among Black residents of census tracts with 20% or more of persons in poverty (most impoverished) was 4.4 times the incidence among White residents of census tracts with less than 5% of persons in poverty (least impoverished). Racial disparities in incidence were reduced but remained significant in models that controlled for age, census tract poverty level, and state. CONCLUSIONS: Adults living in impoverished census tracts are at increased risk of bacteremic pneumonia and should be targeted for prevention efforts.
TI  - Routine use of point-of-care tests: usefulness and application in clinical microbiology.
AB  - Point-of-care (POC) tests offer potentially substantial benefits for the management of infectious diseases, mainly by shortening the time to result and by making the test available at the bedside or at remote care centres. Commercial POC tests are already widely available for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections and for parasitic diseases, including malaria. Infectious diseases specialists and clinical microbiologists should be aware of the indications and limitations of each rapid test, so that they can use them appropriately and correctly interpret their results. The clinical applications and performance of the most relevant and commonly used POC tests are reviewed. Some of these tests exhibit insufficient sensitivity, and should therefore be coupled to confirmatory tests when the results are negative (e.g. Streptococcus pyogenes rapid antigen detection test), whereas the results of others need to be confirmed when positive (e.g. malaria). New molecular-based tests exhibit better sensitivity and specificity than former immunochromatographic assays (e.g. Streptococcus agalactiae detection). In the coming years, further evolution of POC tests may lead to new diagnostic approaches, such as panel testing, targeting not just a single pathogen, but all possible agents suspected in a specific clinical setting. To reach this goal, the development of serology-based and/or molecular-based microarrays/multiplexed tests will be needed. The availability of modern technology and new microfluidic devices will provide clinical microbiologists with the opportunity to be back at the bedside, proposing a large variety of POC tests that will allow quicker diagnosis and improved patient care.
TI  - Biological activity of the essential oil of Kadsura longipedunculata (Schisandraceae) and its major components.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of Kadsura longipedunculata and the biological activity of the oil and its major components. METHODS: The essential oil from stem bark of Kadsura longipedunculata was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (GLC/FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC/MS). The ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (DPPH(*)) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity. Inhibition of both lipoxygenase and prostaglandin E(2) was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. Antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi using diffusion and microdilution methods. Inhibition of trypanosome proliferation was assessed using resazurin as vital stain. The in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (HepG2, MIA PaCa-2, HeLa, HL-60, MDA-MB-231 and SW-480) was examined using the MTT assay. KEY FINDINGS: Fifty compounds, representing 97.63% of total oil, were identified. delta-Cadinene (21.79%), camphene (7.27%), borneol (6.05%), cubenol (5.12%) and delta-cadinol (5.11%) were found to be the major components of the oil. The oil exerted a good antimicrobial activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Streptococcus pyogenes and S. agalactiae were the most sensitive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 60 microg/ml oil. The essential oil showed a moderate fungicidal activity against yeasts, but it did not show any activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The essential oil showed a good trypanocidal activity in Trypanosoma b. brucei with an IC50 value of 50.52 +/- 0.029 microg/ml. Radical scavenging activity had an IC50 value of 3.06 +/- 0.79 mg/ml. 5-Lipoxygenase inhibition (IC50 = 38.58 microg/ml) and prostaglandin E(2) production inhibition (28.82% at 25 microg/ml) accounted for anti-inflammatory activity of the oil. The oil exhibited some degree of cytotoxic activity against MIA PaCa-2, HepG-2 and SW-480 cell lines with IC50 values of 133.53, 136.96 and 136.62 microg/ml, respectively. The oil increased caspase 3/7 activity (an indicator of apoptosis) 2.5-4 fold in MIA Paca-2 cells. Camphene and borneol did not show antioxidant activity. However, both compounds exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, trypanocidal, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation provided evidence for, and confirmed the efficacy of, K. longipedunculata, a traditionally used Chinese medicinal plant for the treatment of inflammation and infection.
TI  - Invasive infection caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis: characteristics of strains and clinical features.
AB  - Among clinically isolated beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. agalactiae were considered the main pathogens in humans until recently. In 1996, S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE) was proposed as a novel taxon among human-derived streptococcal isolates. SDSE has Lancefield group C or G antigens, exhibits strong beta-hemolysis, and exerts streptokinase activity upon human plasminogen and proteolytic activity upon human fibrin. Similarly to group A streptococci, SDSE possesses virulence factors including M protein, streptolysin O, streptolysin S, streptokinase, hyaluronidase, C5a peptidase, and others. SDSE may exist among the normal flora of the skin, oropharynx, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. In the twenty-first century, invasive SDSE infection (i.e., cellulitis, urosepsis, and pneumonia) leading to various disseminated diseases is being diagnosed increasingly in Japan, elsewhere in Asia, in Europe, and in America. Particularly, among elderly patients, these invasive diseases are encountered increasingly in Japanese hospital emergency departments. Analysis of the part of the emm gene encoding the amino acid sequence at the N-terminal end of the M protein is used to determine the molecular epidemiology of SDSE. The distribution of emm types from patients with invasive or noninvasive infections differs between surveillance results from different countries. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of phenotypes and virulence factors in SDSE strains; the review also focuses on emerging SDSE infectious disease and future vaccination research.
TI  - [Molecular features of beta-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood in adult invasive infection and the clinical background factors].
AB  - We studied the relationship between features of beta-hemolytic streptococci (n =  45) isolated from blood in adult invasive infection and the clinical background factors observed from January 2001 through August at a hospital for the elderly. The meanage of subjects having invasive streptococcal infection with 22 invasive Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis (SDSE) strains, 2 S. pyogenes isolates, and 21 S. agalactiae (GBS) was 80 years, and 85.7% and 86.4% had underly diseases in the GBS and SDSE infections. SDSE-infected were mainly emergency woman outpatients and GBS infected were mainly man inpatients. The clinical syndrome involved pneumonia, urosepsis, and cellulitis. GBS mortality was 14.3% and SDSE mortality 27.3%. Compared to survivors, nonsurvivors had more thrombocytopenia and marked serum C-reactive protein elevation when blood culture were performed. No difference was seen in white blood cell count between bath groups. Our observations suggest that blood culture should be obtained before antimicrobials administration in elderly individuals with underlying illness who are seen at the emergency department and have laboratory blood data suggestive of infectious disease.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The activity of ceftobiprole and comparator agents was evaluated against a collection of 880 isolates, comprising 200 meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 200 meticillin-resistant S. aureus, 180 coagulase-negative staphylococci blood isolates, 100 Streptococcuspneumoniae and 200 macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci (100 Streptococcus pyogenes and 100 Streptococcus agalactiae). Ceftobiprole showed excellent activity against staphylococci (minimum inhibitory concentrations <or=4 microg/mL), irrespective of their susceptibility to other agents such as oxacillin, linezolid or glycopeptides. Ceftobiprole was also highly active against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and macrolide-resistant beta-haemolytic streptococci, inhibiting 99.6% of all streptococci tested at <or=0.5 microg/mL. Based on these results, ceftobiprole appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - The changing faces of Streptococcus antigen I/II polypeptide family adhesins.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans antigen I/II (AgI/II) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in Gram-positive bacteria. It mediates attachment of S. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. The AgI/II family polypeptides recognize salivary glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation, tissue invasion and immune modulation. The genes encoding AgI/II family polypeptides are found among Streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. suis. Evidence of functionalities for different regions of the AgI/II proteins has emerged. A sequence motif within the C-terminal portion of Streptococcus gordonii SspB (AgI/II) is bound by Porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. The significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. A new picture emerges of the central V (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench, being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an N-terminal alpha-helix and a C-terminal polyproline helix. This presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other Gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and functional analysis of the tet (M)-carrying conjugative transposon Tn5251 of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The Tn916-like genetic element Tn5251 is part of the composite conjugative transposon (CTn) Tn5253 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a 64.5-kb chromosomal element originally called Omega(cat-tet) BM6001. DNA sequence analysis showed that Tn5251 is 18 033-bp long and contains 22 ORFs, 20 of which have the same direction of transcription. Annotation was possible for 11 out of 22 ORFs, including the tet(M) tetracycline resistance gene and int and xis involved in the integration/excision process. Autonomous copies of Tn5251 were generated during matings of Tn5253-containing donors with S. pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. Tn5251 was shown to integrate at different sites in the bacterial chromosome. It behaves as a fully functional CTn capable of independent conjugal transfer to a variety of bacterial species including S. pneumoniae, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, E. faecalis and Bacillus subtilis. The excision of Tn5251 produces a circular intermediate and a deletion in Tn5253 at a level of 1.2 copies per 10(5) chromosomes.
TI  - [Recombinant fragments of conservative proteins of group B streptococci as a basis of specific vaccine].
AB  - AIM: The study devoted to problem of using of recombinant fragments of group B streptococci (GBS) conservative proteins for induction of immune response against streptococcal infections. Two recombinant polypeptides (ScaAB and-ScpB1) corresponding to immunogenic epitopes of two surface GBS proteins ScaAB and C5a-peptidase, which are presented in other streptococcal species, were studied. The objective of the study was to assess specificity and protective activity of mentioned polypeptides against homologous and heterologous strains of pathogenic streptococci from different groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae were used in the study. Array of used methods included opsonophagocytic test as well as active and passive protection of experimental animals against streptococcal infection. RESULTS: It was shown that antibodies specific to studied polypeptides opsonized several strains of group A and B streptococci as well as pneumococci. Immunization of mice with ScpB1 polypeptide resulted in more rapid recovery of animals from challenge systemic group B streptococcal infection. Antisera specific to both polypeptides provided passive protection of animals from infection caused either GBS or GAS. CONCLUSION: Obtained data confirm the feasibility to use recombinant fragments of several GBS conservative proteins in vaccine for induction of protection against infections caused by different species of pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of beta-hemolytic streptococci isolated from throat swabs and purulent material].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and susceptibility of beta-hemolytic streptococci isolated from throat swabs (142--29.9%) and purulent material (333--70.1%) taken from patients treated at University Hospital dr. A. Jurasz in Bydgoszcz Collegium Medicum. L. Rydygier in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun in 2005-2009. Of the 475 tested strains, 156 (32.8%) were identified as S. pyogenes. This species accounted for 38.8% of strains isolated from purulent material and 19.0% of swabs from the throat. Among the strains isolated from throat swabs of 62 (43.7%) were identified as Streptococcus group C. Only 5.1% strains were identified as Streptococcus group F. All strains of beta-hemolytic streptococci were susceptible to ampicillin or penicillin, fluoroquinolones, vancomycin and linezolid. Erythromycin-susceptible strains was 83.8%, and 89.1% for clindamycin. A total of 51.3% of erythromycin resistance strains had the cMLS(B) phenotype (63.3% for strains from throat swabs and 46.3% of the purulent materials). Sensitivity to tetracycline was characterized by 51.2% of strains of beta-hemolytic streptococci. The percentage of strains susceptible to this antibiotic among isolates from throat swabs was 63.1%, and purulent material--48.0%. The lowest percentage of strains susceptible to tetracycline (14.1%) were found among S. agalactiae and Streptococcus group G (33.6%) strains. During the study time, saw an increase in the percentage of strains susceptible to tetracycline and erythromycin.
TI  - Pyogenic streptococci--danger of re-emerging pathogens.
AB  - Beta-hemolytic, pyogenic streptococci are classified according to type of major surface antigen into A (Streptococcus pyogenes), B (Streptococcus agalactiae), C (multiple species including Streptococcus dysagalactiae) and G (multiple species including Streptococcus canis) Lancefield groups. Group A Streptococcus causes each year hundreds of thousands deaths globally as a result of infections and post-infectional sequelae. An increasing number of severe, invasive infections is caused by selected, specialized pathogenic clones. Within the last 50 years, an increasing number of human infections caused by groups B, C and G Streptococcus (GBS, GCS, GGS) has been observed worldwide. GBS was first identified as animal pathogen but the spectrum of diseases caused by GBS quickly shifted to human infections. Groups C and G Streptococcus are still regarded mostly as animal pathogens, however, an increased number of severe infections caused by these groups is observed. The increasing number of human infections caused worldwide by GCS/GGS can be a sign of similar development from animal to human pathogen as observed in case of GBS and this group will gain much more clinical interest in the future.The situation in Poland regarding invasive infections caused by pyogenic streptococci is underestimated.
TI  - Requirement of the Lactobacillus casei MaeKR two-component system for L-malic acid utilization via a malic enzyme pathway.
AB  - Lactobacillus casei can metabolize L-malic acid via malolactic enzyme (malolactic fermentation [MLF]) or malic enzyme (ME). Whereas utilization of L-malic acid via MLF does not support growth, the ME pathway enables L. casei to grow on L-malic acid. In this work, we have identified in the genomes of L. casei strains BL23 and ATCC 334 a cluster consisting of two diverging operons, maePE and maeKR, encoding a putative malate transporter (maeP), an ME (maeE), and a two-component (TC) system belonging to the citrate family (maeK and maeR). Homologous clusters were identified in Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus uberis. Our results show that ME is essential for L-malic acid utilization in L. casei. Furthermore, deletion of either the gene encoding the histidine kinase or the response regulator of the TC system resulted in the loss of the ability to grow on L-malic acid, thus indicating that the cognate TC system regulates and is essential for the expression of ME. Transcriptional analyses showed that expression of maeE is induced in the presence of L-malic acid and repressed by glucose, whereas TC system expression was induced by L-malic acid and was not repressed by glucose. DNase I footprinting analysis showed that MaeR binds specifically to a set of direct repeats [5'-TTATT(A/T)AA-3'] in the mae promoter region. The location of the repeats strongly suggests that MaeR activates the expression of the diverging operons maePE and maeKR where the first one is also subjected to carbon catabolite repression.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of quinolones against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activities of oral quinolones, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), garenoxacin (GRNX), levofloxacin (LVFX), moxifloxacin (MFLX), norfloxacin (NFLX), prulifloxacin (PUFX), and tosufloxacin (TFLX) using Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, extended spectrum beta-lactamase(ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolated from clinical materials. Based on the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics theory, the target attainment rate at the area under the curve (AUC)/MIC of 120 or more for Gram-negative and 30 or more for Gram-positive bacteria was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and was assessed as the efficacy. GRNX showed the lowest MIC50 and MIC90 values (0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively) against S. pneumoniae, suggesting its potent antimicrobial activity. GRNX also exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, MSSA) other than S. pneumoniae. The antimicrobial activity of CPFX against H. influenzae was most potent. The MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.016 microg/ml each. However, the MIC50 and MIC90 values of the other agents were also favorable. PUFX showed the most potent antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Both of MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.06 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. On efficacy assessment using MCS, GRNX, GFLX, and MFLX showed a probability of 90% or more against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Against S. agalactiae, GRNX, MFLX, and GFLX showed a probability of approximately 60%. All agents showed a low probability against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae; PUFX showed a maximum (43.63%). GRNX, MFLX, GFLX, and LVFX showed a probability of 90% or more against MSSA. Furthermore, we investigated the probability that the target value of resistance inhibition, an AUC/MIC of more than 200 against S. pneumoniae, is achieved. GRNX showed the highest probability (95.05%). It also exhibited a similar probability even when the target value was established as 250. Recently, the widespread use of quinolones has increased the number of quinolone-resistant bacteria. In the future, antimicrobial agents should be selected with respect to more potent therapeutic effects and resistance inhibition, and an appropriate dose and administration method must be employed.
TI  - Phim46.1, the main Streptococcus pyogenes element carrying mef(A) and tet(O) genes.
AB  - Phim46.1, the recognized representative of the most common variant of mobile, prophage-associated genetic elements carrying resistance genes mef(A) (which confers efflux-mediated erythromycin resistance) and tet(O) (which confers tetracycline resistance) in Streptococcus pyogenes, was fully characterized. Sequencing of the Phim46.1 genome (55,172 bp) demonstrated a modular organization typical of tailed bacteriophages. Electron microscopic analysis of mitomycin-induced Phim46.1 revealed phage particles with the distinctive icosahedral head and tail morphology of the Siphoviridae family. The chromosome integration site was within a 23S rRNA uracil methyltransferase gene. BLASTP analysis revealed that the proteins of Phim46.1 had high levels of amino acid sequence similarity to the amino acid sequences of proteins from other prophages, especially Phi10394.4 of S. pyogenes and lambdaSa04 of S. agalactiae. Phage DNA was present in the host cell both as a prophage and as free circular DNA. The lysogeny module appears to have been split due to the insertion of a segment containing tet(O) (from integrated conjugative element 2096-RD.2) and mef(A) (from a Tn1207.1-like transposon) into the unintegrated phage DNA. The phage attachment sequence lies in the region between tet(O) and mef(A) in the unintegrated form. Thus, whereas in this form tet(O) is approximately 5.5 kb upstream of mef(A), in the integrated form, tet(O), which lies close to the right end of the prophage, is approximately 46.3 kb downstream of mef(A), which lies close to the left end of the prophage.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. Organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), Enterococcus faecium (n = 819), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 959), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group C, G, and F streptococci (n = 84), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). Among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. The vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. Penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among S. pneumoniae isolates. Among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. Oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. The maximum oritavancin MIC against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the MIC(90) against S. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. Against E. faecalis and E. faecium, oritavancin MIC(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. Oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including VanA strains (n = 486), with MIC(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against VanA E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); MIC(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. These data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. The data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.
TI  - Clinical aspects of invasive infections with Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis in Japan: differences with respect to Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae infections.
AB  - Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis (SDSE) is increasingly being identified as a pathogen responsible for invasive and non-invasive infections. We compared the clinical features of invasive SDSE infections with those of invasive infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus (GAS)) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus (GBS)). Active surveillance for invasive SDSE, GAS and GBS was maintained over 1 year at 142 medical institutions throughout Japan. Clinical information was collected together with isolates, which were characterized microbiologically. Two hundred and thirty-one invasive SDSE infections were identified, 97 other patients had infections with GAS, and 151 had infections with GBS. The median age of the SDSE patients was 75 years; 51% were male and 79% had underlying diseases. Forty-two SDSE patients (19%) presented to the emergency department. Among the 150 patients (65%) for whom follow-up was completed, 19 (13%) died and eight (5%) had post-infective sequelae (poor outcome). Insufficient white blood cell responses (<5000 cells/microL) and thrombocytopenia on admission each suggested significantly higher risk of poor outcome (ORs 3.6 and 4.5, respectively). Of 229 isolates, 55 (24%) showed an stG6792 emm type, which was significantly associated with poor outcome (OR 2.4). Clinical manifestations of invasive SDSE infections were distinct from those of invasive GBS infections. Primary-care doctors should consider invasive SDSE infections when treating elderly patients.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activity of the essential oil obtained from Bupleurum marginatum (Apiaceae).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bupleurum marginatum is a herb indigenous to the southern and southwestern part of China. It is widely used in many Chinese prescriptions. We aimed to investigate the chemical composition, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and in-vitro cytotoxic activity of the hydrodistilled and extracted essential oil from B. marginatum to validate some of its ethnopharmacologial uses. METHODS: The essential oil of the aerial parts of B. marginatum was analysed by capillary gas chromatography (GLC/FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GLC/MS). The ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (DPPH(.)) and to prevent the degradation of deoxyribose were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity. Inhibition of both prostaglandin E(2) production and lipoxygenase were used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. Antimicrobial activity was studied in vitro against a range of bacteria and fungi. The in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (HepG2, Caco-2, CCRF-CEM, HeLa, MiaPaCa-2 and MCF-7) was examined using the MTT assay. KEY FINDINGS: Seventy-two components, comprising almost 94.29% of the total peak area, were identified in the analysis. The main components were tridecane (13.18%), undecane (10.42%), pentadecane (8.71%), beta-caryophyllene (5.53%) and beta-caryophyllene oxide (5.29%). The ability of the oil to reduce diphenylpicrylhydrazine (DPPH(.)) and to prevent the degradation of deoxyribose were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity and the corresponding IC50 values (drug concentration which resulted in a 50% reduction in inhibition of the activity) were found to be 3.66 mg/ml and 17.4 microg/ml, respectively. Inhibition of both prostaglandin E(2) production and lipoxygenase were used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity (IC50 of 63.64 microg/ml for lipoxygenase, 26.04% inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) at 25 microg/ml dose). The oil also showed a significant in-vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram positive pathogens (Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae) with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 0.125 up to 4.00 mg/ml. The in-vitro cytotoxicity of the essential oil on six human cancer cell lines (HepG2, Caco-2, CCRF-CEM, HeLa, MiaPaCa-2 and MCF-7) examined using the MTT assay revealed the highest activity to be in the CCRF-CEM cell line with an IC50 (concentration which resulted in a 50% reduction in cell viability) of 46.01 microg/ml after 24 h treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The essential oil of B. marginatum exhibited a promising anti-inflammatory activity along with strong cytotoxicity against many cancer cells (CCRF-CEM and HepG2) mediated through induction of apoptosis, and this in-vitro activity make its local traditional uses rational. However, its limited antimicrobial activity indicates that a combination with other drugs is essential for effective use. Further selectivity testing is required to evaluate the effect of the oil against normal cells.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(II) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (OSN2) Schiff base ligands.
AB  - Cobalt ion complexes with the Schiff bases, (4-X-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (X=methoxy (OMe), phenylazo (N(2)Ph), bromo (Br), nitro (NO(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (C, H, N), FTIR, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. The thermal stability of free ligands and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. The synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four Gram-positive bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis and also against the two Gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity data show that the parent Schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.
TI  - Pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  - This paper describes a new DNA chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. Probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus canis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus parauberis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma spp., Salmonella spp., Bacillus spp., Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli and related species. These groups were identified based on the 16S rRNA gene. For microarray validation, 22 strains from the American Type Culture Collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested. The results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. Moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of Mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. The universal array described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.
TI  - Human serum induces streptococcal c5a peptidase expression.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae is a major pathogen in humans and animals. Virulence factors are often associated with mobile genetic elements, and their expression can be modulated by host factors. S. agalactiae harbors the genes for C5a peptidase (scpB) and Lmb on a composite transposon structure which is absent in many bovine isolates. To investigate whether these genes participate in the adaptation to human hosts, we determined the influence of human and bovine serum on the promoter activity of scpB and lmb by using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Culture in the presence of 1 to 50% human serum resulted in a dose-dependent induction of reporter gene activity for scpB but not lmb. Reporter gene activity was, however, unchanged following growth in fetal calf serum. Interestingly, a bovine strain did not display any induction of scpB by either bovine or human serum. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis was used to confirm differential induction of scpB in S. agalactiae and showed a similar induction of the Streptococcus pyogenes C5a peptidase gene scpA by human but not bovine serum. The specific induction of the streptococcal C5a peptidase by human serum corresponds to the absence of scpB in many bovine S. agalactiae isolates and underlines the importance of this virulence factor for human infections.
TI  - Leucine-rich repeats of bacterial surface proteins serve as common pattern recognition motifs of human scavenger receptor gp340.
AB  - Scavenger receptors are innate immune molecules recognizing and inducing the clearance of non-host as well as modified host molecules. To recognize a wide pattern of invading microbes, many scavenger receptors bind to common pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharides and lipoteichoic acids. Similarly, the gp340/DMBT1 protein, a member of the human scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein family, displays a wide ligand repertoire. The peptide motif VEVLXXXXW derived from its scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains is involved in some of these interactions, but most of the recognition mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we used mass spectrometry sequencing, gene inactivation, and recombinant proteins to identify Streptococcus pyogenes protein Spy0843 as a recognition receptor of gp340. Antibodies against Spy0843 are shown to protect against S. pyogenes infection, but no function or host receptor have been identified for the protein. Spy0843 belongs to the leucine-rich repeat (Lrr) family of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins. Experiments with truncated forms of the recombinant proteins confirmed that the Lrr region is needed in the binding of Spy0843 to gp340. The same motif of two other Lrr proteins, LrrG from the Gram-positive S. agalactiae and BspA from the Gram-negative Tannerella forsythia, also mediated binding to gp340. Moreover, inhibition of Spy0843 binding occurred with peptides containing the VEVLXXXXW motif, but also peptides devoid of the XXXXW motif inhibited binding of Lrr proteins. These results thus suggest that the conserved Lrr motif in bacterial proteins serves as a novel pattern recognition motif for unique core peptides of human scavenger receptor gp340.
TI  - Capturing host-pathogen interactions by protein microarrays: identification of novel streptococcal proteins binding to human fibronectin, fibrinogen, and C4BP.
AB  - Microbial pathogen entry and survival in the host is mediated by a network of molecular interactions between the two partners, which has been the subject of many research efforts. A complex picture is emerging in which host-pathogen crosstalk involves a high number of proteins, often with redundant functions. In the present study, we investigated the potential of protein microarrays to simultaneously scan interactions between surface proteins from two main human streptococcal pathogens, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, and three human ligands, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and C4 binding protein, known to play an important role in streptococcal pathogenesis. By using this technology, we confirmed interactions described in the literature and detected a novel set of streptococcal proteins with binding capacities for the human ligands. The observations were validated by Western blot and ELISA techniques. Three of the newly identified proteins were isoforms of a group B streptococcus-secreted component named Fib and displayed differential binding capacities for fibronectin, fibrinogen, and C4BP. The protein regions involved in the interaction with each ligand were identified by constructing fragments of one of the Fib variants. The approach proved valuable for the acquisition of novel insights into the complex network of protein-protein interactions occurring during microbial infection.
TI  - Substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  - Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. Here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal UGLs and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. The putative genes for UGL and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. The UGLs of these three streptococci were overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. Streptococcal UGLs degraded unsaturated hyaluronate and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately pH 5.5 and 37 degrees C. Distinct from Bacillus sp. GL1 UGL, streptococcal UGLs preferred sulfated substrates. DNA microarray and Western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in S. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. The crystal structure of S. agalactiae UGL (SagUGL) was determined at 1.75 A resolution by x-ray crystallography. SagUGL adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to Bacillus UGL, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. SagUGL Arg-236 was found to be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. This is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal UGLs.
TI  - Synergistic and antagonistic hemolytic activities of bacteria of genus Arcanobacterium and CAMP-like hemolysis of Arcanobacterium phocae and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum with Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus.
AB  - A total of 57 bacteria representing eight species of genus Arcanobacterium (A.) were investigated for hemolytic properties on blood agar containing sheep and rabbit blood and for CAMP-like reactions. An enhanced hemolysis on blood agar containing rabbit blood compared to sheep blood could be observed for A. haemolyticum, less pronounced for A. hippocoleae and A. pluranimalium. A synergistic hemolytic reaction with staphylococcal beta-hemolysin appeared to be constantly visible for A. hippocoleae, A. pluranimalium and A. pyogenes, with Streptococcus agalactiae for A. phocae and A. haemolyticum, with Rhodococcus equi for A. phocae, A. haemolyticum, A. pluranimalium and A. pyogenes and with A. haemolyticum for A. hippocoleae, A. pluranimalium and A. pyogenes, respectively. A reverse CAMP-reaction in the zone of staphylococcal beta-hemolysin could be observed for A.phocae and A.haemolyticum. In addition, a novel CAMP-like reaction could be noted between Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing, and A. phocae and A. haemolyticum. These synergistic or antagonistic hemolytic properties could possibly be used as additional criteria for identification of bacteria of genus Arcanobacterium.
TI  - Bacterial phenotype variants in group B streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - We conducted genetic and functional analyses of isolates from a patient with group B streptococcal (GBS) necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. Tissue cultures simultaneously showed colonies with high hemolysis (HH) and low hemolysis (LH). Conversely, the HH and LH variants exhibited low capsule (LC) and high capsule (HC) expression, respectively. Molecular analysis demonstrated that the 2 GBS variants were of the same clonal origin. Genetic analysis found a 3-bp deletion in the covR gene of the HH/LC variant. Functionally, this isolate was associated with an increased growth rate in vitro and with higher interleukin-8 induction. However, in whole blood, opsonophagocytic and intracellular killing assays, the LH/HC phenotype demonstrated higher resistance to host phagocytic killing. In a murine model, LH/HC resulted in higher levels of bacteremia and increased host mortality rate. These findings demonstrate differences in GBS isolates of the same clonal origin but varying phenotypes.
TI  - Model for substrate interactions in C5a peptidase from Streptococcus pyogenes: A  1.9 A crystal structure of the active form of ScpA.
AB  - The crystal structure of an active form of ScpA has been solved to 1.9 A resolution. ScpA is a multidomain cell-envelope subtilase from Streptococcus pyogenes that cleaves complement component C5a. The catalytic triad of ScpA is geometrically consistent with other subtilases, clearly demonstrating that the additional activation mechanism proposed for the Streptococcus agalactiae homologue (ScpB) is not required for ScpA. The ScpA structure revealed that access to the catalytic site is restricted by variable regions in the catalytic domain (vr7, vr9, and vr11) and by the presence of the inserted protease-associated (PA) domain and the second fibronectin type III domains (Fn2). Modeling of the ScpA-C5a complex indicates that the substrate binds with carboxyl-terminal residues (65-74) extended through the active site and core residues (1-64) forming exosite-type interactions with the Fn2 domain. This is reminiscent of the two-site mechanism proposed for C5a binding to its receptor. In the nonprime region of the active site, interactions with the substrate backbone are predicted to be more similar to those observed in kexins, involving a single beta-strand in the peptidase. However, in contrast to kexins, there would be diminished emphasis on side-chain interactions, with little charged character in the S3-S1 and S6-S4 subsites occupied by the side chains of residues in vr7 and vr9. Substrate binding is anticipated to be dominated by ionic interactions in two distinct regions of ScpA. On the prime side of the active site, salt bridges are predicted between P1', P2', and P7' residues, and residues in the catalytic and PA domains. Remote to the active site, a larger number of ionic interactions between residues in the C5a core and the Fn2 domain are observed in the model. Thus, both PA and Fn2 domains are expected to play significant roles in substrate recognition.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive microorganisms: SENTRY surveillance program, Spain (2002-2006)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic,  active against gram-positive bacteria. In this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered in 3 Spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international SENTRY antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. The possible therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of Spanish susceptibility data. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. RESULTS: All the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. The highest MIC values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. In addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against Enterococcus faecalis. Daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. viridans group isolates. The distribution of daptomycin MIC values in S. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. CONCLUSION: The sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in Spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.
TI  - Activity of iclaprim against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  
TI  - The prevalence of erythromycin resistance in group B streptococcal isolates at a  University Hospital in Taiwan.
AB  - Due to reduced antibiotic consumption in Taiwan, erythromycin resistance rate had decreased in Streptococcus pyogenes, but it increased in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The objectives of the present study were (1) to determine the erythromycin and clindamycin resistance rate and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the group B streptococcus (GBS) clinical isolates, and (2) to investigate the mechanism responsible for the macrolide, lincosamide, and group B streptogramin (MLS(B)) resistance. A total of 1,395 GBS isolates were collected from June 2001 to April 2007. Forty-four percent of the GBS isolates were resistant to erythromycin, and 39% were resistant to clindamycin. The annual erythromycin resistance rate increased from 32% in 2001 to 51% in 2004; a significant decrease was observed in 2005 (47%), 2006 (42%), and 2007 (38%). Percentage of erythromycin-resistant isolates with erm(B) gene significantly increased from 72% in 2001 to 90% in 2007. We found that the plasmid encoded zeta gene was present in 13% of the resistant isolates, along with erm(B). When compared to our previous study (1991 to May 2001), the overall erythromycin resistance rate increased from 30% to 44%. erm(B) was the major resistant determinant, and zeta toxin encoding plasmid has a limited role in mediating erythromycin resistance unlike in GAS isolates as reported earlier.
TI  - Evasion of macrophage scavenger receptor A-mediated recognition by pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - PRR recognize conserved structures on pathogenic microbes and are important for the defense against invading microorganisms. However, accumulating evidence indicates that many pathogens have evolved mechanisms to avoid recognition by PRR. One type of PRR is the macrophage scavenger receptor A (SR-A), which has been shown to play an important role in recognition and non-opsonic phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria. The bacterial ligands for SR-A have been suggested to be LPS or lipoteichoic acid. Here, we use murine bone marrow-derived macrophages to analyze the role of SR-A in non-opsonic phagocytosis of two major Gram-positive pathogens, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus; GBS) and Streptococcus pyogenes. We show that the polysaccharide capsule of GBS and the surface M protein of S. pyogenes, two important virulence factors, prevent SR-A-mediated non-opsonic phagocytosis of streptococci. The sialic acid moiety of the GBS capsule was crucial for its ability to prevent recognition by SR-A. Moreover, we show that a ligand on GBS recognized by SR-A in the absence of capsule is the surface lipoprotein Blr. These findings represent the first example of a microbial strategy to prevent recognition by SR-A and suggest that bacterial surface proteins may be of importance as ligands for SR-A.
TI  - Characterization of Streptococcus gordonii prophage PH15: complete genome sequence and functional analysis of phage-encoded integrase and endolysin.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii OMZ1039, isolated from supragingival dental plaque, was found to harbour a prophage, PH15, whose excision could be induced by mitomycin treatment. Phage PH15 belongs to the Siphoviridae. The complete genome sequence of PH15 was determined. The genome was 39 136 bp in size and contained 61 ORFs. The genome of PH15 was most similar in the structural module to the temperate bacteriophages MM1 and phiNIH1.1 from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. In strain OMZ1039, PH15 was found to reside as a prophage in the cysteinyl-tRNA gene. A plasmid, harbouring the attP site and the integrase gene downstream of a constitutive promoter, was capable of site-specific integration into the genomes of different oral streptococcal species. The phage endolysin was purified after expression in Escherichia coli and found to inhibit growth of all S. gordonii strains tested and several different streptococcal species, including the pathogens Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in Greece.
AB  - A total of 10420 Gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten Greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to daptomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth microdilution method. Daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC50) = 1mg/L and MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) = 1.36 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC50 = 1.36 mg/L and MIC90 = 1.90 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.50mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50 = 0.09 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50 = 0.50 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.89 mg/L). Resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. On the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 = 0.44 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.78 mg/L) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.44 mg/L); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an MIC > 1mg/L, which is the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. For all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.
TI  - Proposed MIC and disk diffusion microbiological cutoffs and spectrum of activity  of retapamulin, a novel topical antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Retapamulin, the first pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent approved for the topical treatment of skin infections in humans, was tested against 987 clinical isolates representing 30 species and/or resistance groups. MICs were determined along with disk diffusion zone diameters using a 2-microg disk. Population distribution and MIC versus disk zone diameter scattergrams were analyzed to determine microbiological MIC cutoff values and inhibition zone correlates. Minimum bactericidal concentrations were performed on a smaller subset of key species. The retapamulin MIC(90) against 234 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 110 coagulase-negative staphylococci was 0.12 microg/ml. Retapamulin MIC(90)s ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml against beta-hemolytic streptococci including 102 Streptococcus pyogenes, 103 Streptococcus agalactiae, 59 group C Streptococcus, and 71 group G Streptococcus isolates. The MIC(90) against 55 viridans group streptococci was 0.25 microg/ml. Retapamulin had very little activity against 151 gram-negative bacilli and most of the Enterococcus species tested. Based on the data from this study, for staphylococci, MICs of <or=0.5, 1, and >or=2 microg/ml with corresponding disk diffusion values of >or=20 mm, 17 to 19 mm, and <or=16 mm can be proposed for susceptible, intermediate, and resistant microbiological cutoffs, respectively. For beta-hemolytic streptococci, a susceptible-only MIC of <or=0.25 microg/ml with a corresponding disk diffusion value of >or=15 mm can be proposed for susceptible-only microbiological cutoffs.
TI  - Randomized, comparative efficacy trial of oral penicillin versus cefuroxime for perianal streptococcal dermatitis in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of penicillin compared with cefuroxime for group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes (GABHS) perianal dermatitis. STUDY DESIGN: Children 1 to 16 years of age with signs and symptoms of perianal dermatitis and a positive anal swab were randomized to penicillin or cefuroxime treatment and were clinically re-evaluated on day 3 and at the end of treatment (cefuroxime, day 7; penicillin, day 10). An anal swab was obtained to document eradication of GABHS at the end of treatment. Severity of disease was assessed with a clinical score (perianal erythema, 5 points; perianal itch, 3 points; painful defecation, 3 points; constipation, 2 points). RESULTS: Patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to penicillin (n = 18) or cefuroxime (n = 17) treatment. Treatment with penicillin was inferior to cefuroxime, which led to premature study termination after consultation with the ethics committee. Clinical improvement was more rapid in the cefuroxime group (P = .028) and GAHBS was not isolated from the anus the last day of therapy in 13 of 14 patients treated with cefuroxime compared with 7 of 15 patients treated with penicillin (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Cefuroxime was more effective than penicillin and therefore should be considered as the treatment of choice for perianal dermatitis due to GABHS.
TI  - Infections with beta-haemolytic streptococci: detection by a universal PCR for bacterial DNA and DNA sequencing.
AB  - PCR using universal bacterial primers and subsequent DNA sequence analysis of the PCR product was used to detect beta-haemolytic streptococci in clinical samples. Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were identified in 19 primary culture-negative cases of infections from 203 patient samples with detectable bacterial DNA.
TI  - The role of complex carbohydrate catabolism in the pathogenesis of invasive streptococci.
AB  - Historically, the study of bacterial catabolism of complex carbohydrates has contributed to understanding basic bacterial physiology. Recently, however, genome-wide screens of streptococcal pathogenesis have identified genes encoding proteins involved in complex carbohydrate catabolism as participating in pathogen infectivity. Subsequent studies have focused on specific mechanisms by which carbohydrate utilization proteins might contribute to the ability of streptococci to colonize and infect the host. Moreover, transcriptome and biochemical analyses have uncovered novel regulatory pathways by which streptococci link environmental carbohydrate availability to virulence factor production. Herein we review new insights into the role of complex carbohydrates in streptococcal host-pathogen interaction.
TI  - [Occurrence and drug-resistance of beta-hemolytic streptococci].
AB  - The aim of this study was the analysis of drug-resistance and frequency appearance of beta-hemolytic streptococci strains which were isolated in 2003-2005 in the University Hospital at the L. Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz University of Nicolaus Copernicus in Torun. Among investigeted beta-hemolytic streptococci the most frequency isolated species was S. agalactiae. All isolates examined in our study were susceptible to penicillin, the higest rate of resistance was found for tetracycline. The rates of resistence to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (phenotyp MLS(B)) were as follows: S. agalactiae (18.7%), S. pyogenes (10.1%), group G streptococci (10.6%) and group C streptococci (8.0%). In our study we presented also a special case patient from which in investigeted period S. agalactiae was isolated twenty eight times. For ten chromosomal DNA isolated from this patient three different PFGE profiles were obtained.
TI  - [Antibiotics susceptibility of Streptococcus and Enterococcus: data of Onerba network].
AB  - This work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae), or in animals (Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Data were recorded since 1996 through the Onerba networks. S. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in S. pyogenes. In 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. A similar trend was observed for S. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals S. suis and S. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. In enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. Indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in E. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of E. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. From 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in French hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. However, the recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in French hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. Such trend in macrolide resistance among S. pyogenes or S. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of heyneanol A extracted from the root of Taiwanese wild grape.
AB  - AIMS: To search for antimicrobial compounds against pathogenic bacteria from grape vines (Vitis spp.). To investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of active compounds towards methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS AND RESULTS: The root extracts of taiwanese wild grape (Vitis thunbergii var. taiwaniana) showed marked activities against Gram-positive bacteria using the disc diffusion method. After purification, the active compound 1 was confirmed as heyneanol A by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Heyneanol A showed an minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 2 microg ml(-1) towards MRSA and a value of 2 to 4 microg ml(-1) for Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the contents of heyneanol A were determined as 36 mg g(-1) in roots of taiwanese wild grape. CONCLUSIONS: The root extracts of grapevines have good antimicrobial activities towards some strains of Gram-positive pathogens. Heyneanol A, the major antimicrobial compound, is especially active towards MRSA. In addition, the abundances of heyneanol A and other stilbenes in the roots of grapevines make it possible to produce natural antimicrobial compounds from this plant species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study reports for the first time the antimicrobial compounds in the root extracts of grapevines. The results will have clinical significance owing to their activities against MRSA.
TI  - [Lipoteichoic and teichoic acids of pathogenic streptococci: structure, functions, and role in interaction of the infectious agent with organism].
AB  - Features of structure, localization, and function of teichoic (TA) and lipoteichoic acids (LPA) of gram-positive bacteria are shortly characterized. Structures of polymers obtained from Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae are described. The role of TA and LPA of pathogenic streptococci in different phases of infectious process and requirements for biological activity of these molecules are discussed.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriophage lysin (Ply700) from Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - The antibacterial properties of bacteriophage lytic enzymes may be of importance  in future mastitis control programs. A prophage was isolated from a strain of Streptococcus uberis (ATCC 700407) following exposure to mitomycin C. Partial sequencing of the phage DNA revealed a putative lysin based on sequence similarity to other streptococcal phage lysins. The putative lysin (Ply700) was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, and chromatographically purified. Addition of the purified Ply700 to bacterial suspensions of S. uberis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae caused a rapid, calcium-dependent lysis while there was little activity against Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, or E. coli. Killing of S. uberis in milk by Ply700 (50 microg/ml) was confirmed by plate count assay. Activity was related to the initial concentration of bacteria in that 31% killing (P<0.05) was observed with an inoculating dose of approximately 4500 cfu/ml, while 81% killing (P<0.01) was observed when the inoculum was reduced to approximately 600 cfu/ml. In contrast, complete sterilization was observed in parallel cultures suspended in assay buffer indicating that factors in milk are able to neutralize the lysin. Functional characterization of the C-terminal domain, as a component of a GFP fusion protein, revealed its calcium-dependent ability to bind to S. uberis. The C-terminal domain may have utility in targeting S. uberis while it remains to be determined if the lysin by itself has sufficient potency in milk for effective use in the control of S. uberis mastitis.
TI  - Antibiotic resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An antibiotic-sensitivity study was conducted on 117 strains of group  A streptococcus (GAS), 60 strains of group G streptococcus (GGS) and 20 strains of group C streptococcus (GCS) in order to understand current resistance trends. METHODS: All strains were tested by the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method to 15 antibiotics. Resistant strains were confirmed by testing the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics by broth dilution technique. RESULTS: Among GAS, highest resistance was observed to tetracycline (27.4%) and erythromycin (16.2%). The GGS and GCS tested, showed similar resistance patterns. CONCLUSION: All beta-hemolytic streptococci were susceptible to penicillin, amoxycillin, cephalosporins and linezolid. Resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and quinolones is emerging.
TI  - [Streptococcus agalactiae sak0192 gene contains direct repeats and spacers that are genetic markers for characterizing the strains].
AB  - A new approach to differentiation of the Streptococcus agalactiae strains was suggested. The approach is based on the nucleotide polymorphism of the sak0192 gene containing variable number of 16 bp direct repeats and 44 bp spacer regions in different S. Agalactiae strains. In general, the direct repeats were identical, while the spacers were variable. Overall, the structure of the sak0192 gene of S. Agalactiae was analogous to direct repeat cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The applicability of the sak0192 gene polymorphism as a novel genetic marker to identification of S. Agalactiae and differentiation of the strains was demonstrated.
TI  - Nonimmunodominant regions are effective as building blocks in a streptococcal fusion protein vaccine.
AB  - Identification of antigens that elicit protective immunity is essential for effective vaccine development. We investigated the related surface proteins of group B Streptococcus, Rib and alpha, as potential vaccine candidates. Paradoxically, nonimmunodominant regions proved to be of particular interest as vaccine components. Mouse antibodies elicited by Rib and alpha were directed almost exclusively against the C-terminal repeats and not against the N-terminal regions. However, a fusion protein derived from the nonimmunodominant N-terminal regions of Rib and alpha was much more immunogenic than one derived from the repeats and was immunogenic even without adjuvant. Moreover, antibodies to the N-terminal fusion protein protected against infection and inhibited bacterial invasion of epithelial cells. Similarly, the N-terminal region of Streptococcus pyogenes M22 protein, which is targeted by opsonic antibodies, is nonimmunodominant. These data indicate that nonimmunodominant regions of bacterial antigens could be valuable for vaccine development.
TI  - Improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. However, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. This study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated NucliSens miniMAG instrument coupled to 16S rDNA sequencing on 76 samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. No pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. Classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. RESULTS: Our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The overall PCR sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. The overall PCR specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of PCR inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial DNA. Our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.
TI  - Effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  - The activity of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of S. agalactiae, 20 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of H. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on VERO cells by the MTT test. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. H. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and S. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae. The antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild activity on mumps virus.
TI  - Macrolide resistance trends in beta-hemolytic streptococci in a tertiary Korean hospital.
AB  - PURPOSE: Erythromycin-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) has recently emerged and quickly spread between and within countries throughout the world. In this study, we evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and erythromycin resistance mechanisms of BHS during 2003-2004. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MICs of seven antimicrobials were determined for 204 clinical isolates of BHS from 2003 to 2004. Resistance mechanisms of erythromycin-resistant BHS were studied by the double disk test as well as by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Compared with our previous study, resistance among Streptococcus pyogenes isolates to a variety of drugs decreased strikingly: from 25.7% to 4.8% in erythromycin; 15.8% to 0% in clindamycin; and 47.1% to 19.0% in tetracycline. The prevalent phenotypes and genotypes of macrolide-lincosamide-streptograminB (MLSB) resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes isolates have been changed from the constitutive MLSB phenotype carrying erm(B) to the M phenotype with mef(A) gene. In contrast with Streptococcus pyogenes, resistance rates to erythromycin (36.7%), clindamycin (43.1%), and tetracycline (95.4%) in Streptococcus agalactiae isolates did not show decreasing trends. Among the Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates (Lancefield group C, G), resistance rates to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol were observed to be 9.4%, 3.1%, 68.8%, and 9.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Continual monitoring of antimicrobial resistance among large-colony-forming BHS is needed to provide the medical community with current data regarding the resistance mechanisms that are most common to their local or regional environments.
TI  - In vitro activity of novel rifamycins against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - We describe novel rifamycins that have improved activity, compared with rifampin, against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC(90)s of 0.008 and 0.0005 microg/ml, respectively. This enhanced antibacterial activity, along with their potential lack of drug-drug interactions, are considerations that suggest the potential of these novel rifamycins in combination therapy to treat serious Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Spectrum of beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections in a tertiary health centre.

TI  - [Surgical concept and results of necrotizing fasciitis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is still a source of high morbidity and mortality. These difficult cases are increasingly referred to burn centers due to special wound and critical care issues. Here we examine our institution's recent experience with a large series of NF. METHOD: We performed a retrospective chart review of 32 consecutive patients over a 10-year period with NF who required radical surgical debridement and surface reconstruction. RESULTS: Overall survival was 85%, with average length of stay of 74.0+/-7.5 days for survivors (S) and 68.8+/-6.3 days for nonsurvivors (NS) (P>0.05). Time until first operation was 5.2 days in S and 3.4 days in NS (P<0.05). Patient age averaged 51.1+/-11.2 years for S and 57.0+/-12.0 years for NS (P<0.05). Survivors averaged 1.6 relevant comorbidities and NS averaged 3.6 (P<0.05). Affected total body surface (TBS) per patient averaged 6.8+/-3.3% for S and 10.2+/-5.1% for NS (P<0.05). All NS had affection of the trunk, and none of the patients with exclusive affection of extremities died. CONCLUSIONS: There were frequent delays in diagnosis and referrals to our institution, and progress can be made in educating the medical community to identify these patients. Not only the affected TBS and location but also comorbidities, age, and immediate surgical treatment are important prognostic factors. Referral to a specialized facility such as a burn center is urgently recommended for optimal surgical intervention, wound care, and critical care management.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant Gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  - This study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. Overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.015-0.5mg/L, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and MR staphylococci. Tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci, with MICs for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) of 0.25 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, being more active than linezolid (MIC(90)=2 mg/L) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/L, respectively). Molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(M), erm(B) and erm(C) in Streptococcus agalactiae; tet(O), variably associated with different erm genes, in Streptococcus pyogenes; vanA, tet(M) and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecalis, and vanA and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecium. All the MRSA strains harboured SCCmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(K) with tet(M) genes. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. These results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a MIC(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/L both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates recently  obtained in Europe.
AB  - The in vitro activity of telavancin was tested against 620 gram-positive isolates. For staphylococci, MICs at which 50 and 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(50) and MIC(90)) were both 0.25 microg/ml, irrespective of methicillin resistance. MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml for vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and 1 and 2 microg/ml for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci were inhibited by < or =0.12 microg/ml.
TI  - Apparent contrasting rates of pharyngitis and pyoderma in regions where rheumatic heart disease is highly prevalent.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to describe the epidemiology of pharyngitis  and pyoderma in a Central Australian Aboriginal community with a high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and compare it to communities in the Top End of the Northern Territory. METHODS: Following ethics approval and community consultation, selected households were enrolled and visited over a 13-month period. People were asked if they had a sore throat and/or skin sores and asked about current or recent use of antibiotics; all throats and any pyoderma lesions were swabbed for bacterial culture. Beta-haemolytic streptococci (BHS), including group A streptococcus (GAS), were identified in the central laboratory using standard methods. Household crowding was also assessed. Results were then compared to those from the Top End study. RESULTS: Sore throat was relatively common (480 episodes per 100 person years), although there was only one case of GAS pharyngitis in 326 consultations. Only 5.5% of children <15 years had pyoderma during the course of the study. This is the opposite picture to that reported in the Top End where symptomatic pharyngitis is rare and pyoderma is common. CONCLUSIONS: Although the data are limited, the epidemiology of pharyngitis and pyoderma in this Central Australian Aboriginal community appears to be more akin to that seen in temperate climates rather than tropical Top End communities. In this community, RHD preventative measure should continue to include aggressive treatment of pharyngitis according to recommendations.
TI  - Identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating SOS mutagenesis in Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - Streptococci have been considered to lack the classical SOS response, defined by  increased mutation after UV exposure and regulation by LexA. Here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated SOS mutagenesis gene cassette in the Streptococcaceae family. Exposure to UV light was found to increase mutations to antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus uberis cultures. The mutational spectra revealed mainly G:C-->A:T transitions, and Northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a Y-family DNA polymerase resembling UmuC under DNA-damaging conditions. In the absence of the Y-family polymerase, S. uberis cells were sensitive to UV light and to mitomycin C. Furthermore, the UV-induced mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the Y-family polymerase. The gene encoding the Y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a HdiR homolog. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that S. uberis HdiR binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. Database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several Streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus thermophilus strains. In addition, the umuC operon was localized in several mobile DNA elements of Streptococcus and Lactococcus species. We conclude that the hdiR-umuC-ORF3-ORF4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating SOS mutagenesis among members of the Streptococcaceae.
TI  - Evolution of the core and pan-genome of Streptococcus: positive selection, recombination, and genome composition.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genus Streptococcus is one of the most diverse and important human and agricultural pathogens. This study employs comparative evolutionary analyses of 26 Streptococcus genomes to yield an improved understanding of the relative roles of recombination and positive selection in pathogen adaptation to their hosts. RESULTS: Streptococcus genomes exhibit extreme levels of evolutionary plasticity, with high levels of gene gain and loss during species and strain evolution. S. agalactiae has a large pan-genome, with little recombination in its core-genome, while S. pyogenes has a smaller pan-genome and much more recombination of its core-genome, perhaps reflecting the greater habitat, and gene pool, diversity for S. agalactiae compared to S. pyogenes. Core-genome recombination was evident in all lineages (18% to 37% of the core-genome judged to be recombinant), while positive selection was mainly observed during species differentiation (from 11% to 34% of the core-genome). Positive selection pressure was unevenly distributed across lineages and biochemical main role categories. S. suis was the lineage with the greatest level of positive selection pressure, the largest number of unique loci selected, and the largest amount of gene gain and loss. CONCLUSION: Recombination is an important evolutionary force in shaping Streptococcus genomes, not only in the acquisition of significant portions of the genome as lineage specific loci, but also in facilitating rapid evolution of the core-genome. Positive selection, although undoubtedly a slower process, has nonetheless played an important role in adaptation of the core-genome of different Streptococcus species to different hosts.
TI  - Albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with Yersinia enterocolitica and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. Albomycin was found to be active against bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. We examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that Enterobacteriaceae except species of Proteus and Morganella were sensitive. Resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. Among Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. The in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with S. pneumoniae or Yersinia enterocolitica. A single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of Y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. A single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear S. pneumoniae infections in mice. In direct competition experiments with wild-type S. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. We conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in a mouse model. Albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. The ferrichrome transport system serves as a Trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.
TI  - [Comparison of antimicrobial and bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects of macrolides antibiotics against clinical isolates, and examination of shape alteration by scanning electron microscope].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides (MLs), erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), azithromycin (AZM) and rokitamycin (RKM), against 4 bacterial species of clinical strains isolated in 2004. Bacterial isolates used were 51 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 20 of Streptococcus pyogenes, 68 of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 120 of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Macrolide resistance genes, ermB and mefE, in macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, and all of pneumococci were analyzed by PCR. Antimicrobial activities against macrolide-susceptible MSSA of EM and CAM, were more potent than those of RKM. By contrast, against S. pneumoniae, RKM was more effective than EM, CAM and AZM. Against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, 4 antibiotics showed similar antimicrobial activities. Twelve, 1 and 2 strains of MSSA, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to EM, CAM and AZM, whereas RKM was active to almost, but not quite, of them. Among 120 strains of S. pneumoniae, 76 (63.3%) were resistant to EM (MIC; > or = 0.5 microg/mL), and 23, 15 and 28 strains were highly resistant (MIC; > 128 microg/mL) to EM, CAM and AZM, respectively. By contrast, for RKM, there were far fewer resistant strains, and there was no highly resistant strain. PCR analyses of macrolide-resistant genes revealed that 1 resistant strain of S. pyogenes and 2 of S. agalactiae carried mefE and ermB, respectively. In the case of S. pneumoniae, 59, 19 and 5 strains, respectively, carried ermB, mefE and both ermB and mefe. We also studied about bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (PAE) of MLs using macrolide-susceptible, and ermB- and mefE-carrying S. pneumoniae, and observed morphological alterations of the strains treated with the drugs by a scanning electron microscope. It was demonstrated that RKM had superior bactericidal activities and PAE than other 3 drugs, and potent destructive effects to all of 3 strains.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Screening of the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the cytotoxicity and the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on major respiratory tract pathogens. The cytotoxicity of 13 essential oils was evaluated on Vero cells. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration against Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolated from clinical specimens. The antibiotic sensitivity of these isolates was examined. Some oils showed inhibition of bacterial growth against most of the organisms examined. Cinnamon and thyme showed the strongest action followed by clove. The results reported in this paper indicate that thyme can be considered as a potential antimicrobial agent for the treatment of some respiratory tract infections in man.
TI  - Acute deaths in nonpregnant adults due to invasive streptococcal infections.
AB  - Streptococcal organisms, part of the normal human bacterial flora, occasionally become infectious pathogens responsible for a wide array of clinical syndromes, ranging from mild pharyngitis to death. Notably, infections due to group A and group B beta-hemolytic strains are well known for causing invasive disease leading to death. These deaths, while often suspected clinically, occasionally are not diagnosed until autopsy. We present 3 rapid deaths, with very different presentations, due to streptococcal infection. Two decedents experienced sudden deaths due to pneumonia and severe meningoencephalitis caused by group B beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, a common cause of neonatal meningitis but only rarely reported in nonpregnant adults. The final case involves a 69-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with a complaint of shoulder pain but over the next several hours developed signs of necrotizing fasciitis, became septic, and died. While antemortem cultures were negative, owing to antibiotic administration, postmortem cultures of bone and deep soft tissue were positive for group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus sp. Acute and sudden deaths due to infectious etiology represent an uncommon yet well-documented occurrence. The importance of appropriate postmortem cultures in these situations and a review of the literature will be discussed.
TI  - [Necrotizing subcutaneous infection by Streptococcus agalactiae].
AB  - Necrotizing soft tissue infections constitute some of the most potentially threatening infections that may be acquired in the community or in the hospital milieu as they are associated with a high mortality rate. In most cases they are produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. We report a case of a necrotizing soft tissue infection caused by Streptococcus agalactiae (group B beta hemolytic streptococcus) that involved the leg of an elderly man with chronic lymphatic leukemia and diabetes mellitus. The lesions notably improved after initiating intravenous antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavunate and clindamycin.
TI  - Genotype and phenotype relationship in MLSb resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes  and Streptococcus agalactiae isolated in central Italy.
AB  - The aim of this work is to study a correlation between phenotype and genotype in  clinical isolates of erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus spp. Among the 25 erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes, we detected six strains with iMLSB, nine with cMLSB and two with M phenotypes. Among 14 erythromycin-resistant S. agalactiae, we detected five strains with iMLSB, seven with cMLSB and none with an M phenotype. Moreover, 8 S. pyogenes and 2 S. agalactiae showed a phenotype not matching the known ones described in literature, defining an unknown phenotype. Upon examination, the genetic profiles, erm(A), erm(B) and mef(A), of the clinical isolates did not easily correlate with a specific phenotype. Our findings highlighted that the whole matter of phenotypic diversity in macrolide-resistant S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae strains and the correlation with their genetic profiles should be submitted to a more careful analysis of phenotypic and genotypic characterization.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - [Emm typing by genetic identification of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis and susceptibility to oral antibiotics].
AB  - A total of 593 beta-hemolytic streptococci belonging to Lancefield group A (GAS), group C (GCS) or group G (GGS) according to agglutination tests were collected from 11 medical institutions between September 2003 and October 2005. In total, 128 strains were identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (S. equisimilis) using physiological tests. Of these strains, 5 strains were agglutinated to Lancefield group A, 17 strains to group C, and 106 strains to group G. Most of these strains were largely isolated from clinical specimens collected from young patients with respiratory infections and middle-aged patients (in their 40s); most of the strains were isolated from blood, atretic pus, or joint fluid. Genetic analysis of the emm gene encoding the M protein revealed that these strains could be classified into 27 types. Also, many emm types were found in strains isolated from normally aseptic clinical specimens. In addition, all strains tested had slo, sagA, and skcg genes, which contributed to their virulence. The susceptibility of the strains to oral penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics was excellent, with MICs ranging from 0.016 to 0.031mg/mL. In contrast, strains carrying the macrolide resistant elements of the ermA, ermB, and mefA genes and strains showing a high resistance to levofloxacin were also confirmed in this study. These results suggest that beta-hemolytic streptococci, except for S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, should be reconsidered as a causative pathogen in streptococcal infections.
TI  - Etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of Poland.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of Poland in years 2003-2005. Bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. Some Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of API tests (Analytical Profile Index). It was found that 32.7% of samples that were CMT positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. Streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (14.6%), Staph. aureus (8.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and Corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among Gram-negative bacilli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), Serratia marcescens (3.1%), Pasteurella multocida (3.1%), Acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria species. Stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), Staph. hyicus (12.2%), Staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), Staph. sciuri (11.6%), Staph. chromogenes (8.8%), Staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and Staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent CNS. Streptococcus uberis (50%), Str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), Str. acidominimus (6.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among CAMP-negative streptococci. An increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by Str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.
TI  - Gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  - Bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a predominant force in bacterial evolution. To better understand the significance of LGT, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal genomes using a maximum likelihood method. This study indicates that the rate of gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each species. We have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by LGT and conclude that at least a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.
TI  - DNA methylase activity as a marker for the presence of a family of phage-like elements conferring efflux-mediated macrolide resistance in streptococci.
AB  - Recently, two related chimeric genetic elements (Tn1207.3 and Phi10394.4) were shown to carry the macrolide efflux gene mef in Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci [GAS]). The dissemination of elements belonging to the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family in recent isolates of GAS, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae recovered in Portugal was surveyed. In total, 149 GAS, 18 S. pneumoniae, 4 S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and 5 S. agalactiae isolates from infections, presenting the M phenotype of macrolide resistance and containing the mef gene, were screened for the presence of Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 by PCR targeting open reading frames (ORFs) specific for these related elements. All the GAS isolates tested and one of the S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates carried Tn1207.3. However, neither of these elements was found in the isolates of the other streptococcal species. It was also noted that the DNAs of the isolates carrying Tn1207.3 were resistant to cleavage by the endonuclease SmaI. Cloning and expression of ORF12 of Tn1207.3 in Escherichia coli showed that it encoded a methyltransferase that rendered DNA refractory to cleavage by SmaI (M.Spy10394I). Using this characteristic as a marker for the presence of the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family, we reviewed the literature and concluded that these genetic elements are widely distributed among tetracycline-susceptible GAS isolates presenting the M phenotype from diverse geographic origins and may have played an important role in the dissemination of macrolide resistance in this species.
TI  - Lower extremity reconstruction after necrotising fasciitis and necrotic skin lesions using a porcine-derived skin substitute.
AB  - Seven consecutive clinical cases of necrotising fasciitis or necrotic skin lesions (42-78 years old; average 65.0 years of age, three females and four males) due to group A Streptococcus, group B Streptococcus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lower extremities, who demonstrated rapid systemic symptoms, were investigated for the usefulness of a bilayer artificial dermis, derived from porcine tendons, over 4 +/- 2.4 years (1-7 years). All surgical debridement was confirmed as sufficiently deep and wide for clinically infected lesions and artificial dermis was applied to all wounds. The average interval to secondary split-thickness skin grafting was about 17.5 days (17.5 +/- 2.44 days, 21 days max., 14 days min.) and the average thickness was 0.009 +/- 0.0022 in. (range: 0.006 - 0.012 in.). No clinical problems were noted during the application of the artificial dermis and the subsequent skin grafting. Since, the donated skin graft was thin, the morbidity was minimised. The use of artificial dermis after extensive surgical debridement in necrotising fasciitis was easy and effective. Local or systemic infection was negligible.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Characterization of fluoroquinolone-resistant beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. isolated in North America and Europe including the first report of fluoroquinolone-resistant Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-2004).
AB  - Beta-hemolytic streptococci are common bacterial pathogens that can cause serious invasive disease, and although this group of species has remained susceptible to the fluoroquinolone class, resistant strains have been reported. This multicenter investigation determined the rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci using the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program network data (1997-2004). Forty-seven surveillance culture isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci from North America and Europe with elevated levofloxacin MIC results (2 to >32) microg/mL were tested for susceptibility to other fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin, garenoxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin using reference broth microdilution and Etest (BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) methods. Strains were characterized using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing to detect mutations in the quinolone-resistance determining region (QRDR). The beta-hemolytic streptococci isolates with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility included the following Lancefield groups: A (Streptococcus pyogenes; 9 strains), B (Streptococcus agalactiae; 24 strains), C and G (14 strains). Vitek and API 20 strep (bioMerieux, Hazelwood, MO) identification systems, as well as conventional biochemical methods and colony morphology, were used to confirm the organism identifications. The overall potency (MIC90 in microg/mL) for the fluoroquinolones against all tested beta-hemolytic streptococci showed the following rank order: gemifloxacin (0.06) > garenoxacin (0.12) > moxifloxacin (0.25) > gatifloxacin (0.5) > levofloxacin = ciprofloxacin (1). The rate of levofloxacin-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci in the SENTRY program was 0.14% (Europe) and 0.51% (North America) during the study period. All levofloxacin-resistant strains tested by molecular methods had significant mutations in either parC (position 79 or 83) and/or gyrA (position 81 or 85). All but 2 isolates with high-level resistance to levofloxacin (>32 microg/mL) had gyrA mutations. Strains with lower MIC values to levofloxacin (2-4 microg/mL) only had mutations in parC. The increasing rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and the more recently reported beta-hemolytic streptococci, is becoming a clinical concern due to the morbidity and mortality caused by these pathogens.
TI  - Prophagic DNA fragments in Streptococcus agalactiae strains and association with  neonatal meningitis.
AB  - We identified-by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis at the population level followed by DNA differential display, cloning, and sequencing-three prophage DNA fragments (F5, F7, and F10) in Streptococcus agalactiae that displayed significant sequence similarity to the DNA of S. agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The F5 sequence aligned with a prophagic gene encoding the large subunit of a terminase, F7 aligned with a phage-associated cell wall hydrolase and a phage-associated lysin, and F10 aligned with a transcriptional regulator (ArpU family) and a phage-associated endonuclease. We first determined the prevalence of F5, F7, and F10 by PCR in a collection of 109 strains isolated in the 1980s and divided into two populations: one with a high risk of causing meningitis (HR group) and the other with a lower risk of causing meningitis (LR group). These fragments were significantly more prevalent in the HR group than in the LR group (P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that lysogeny has increased the ability of some S. agalactiae strains to invade the neonatal brain endothelium. We then determined the prevalence of F5, F7, and F10 by PCR in a collection of 40 strains recently isolated from neonatal meningitis cases for comparison with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) strains isolated in the 1980s. The prevalence of the three prophage DNA fragments was similar in these two populations isolated 15 years apart. We suggest that the prophage DNA fragments identified have remained stable in many CSF S. agalactiae strains, possibly due to their importance in virulence or fitness.
TI  - The streptococcal Blr and Slr proteins define a family of surface proteins with leucine-rich repeats: camouflaging by other surface structures.
AB  - Regions with tandemly arranged leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) have been found in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, in which they provide a remarkably versatile framework for the formation of ligand-binding sites. Bacterial LRR proteins include the recently described Slr protein of Streptococcus pyogenes, which is related to internalin A of Listeria monocytogenes. Here, we show that strains of the human pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae express a protein, designated Blr, which together with Slr defines a family of internalin A-related streptococcal LRR proteins. Analysis with specific antibodies demonstrated that Blr is largely inaccessible on S. agalactiae grown in vitro, but surface exposure was increased approximately 100-fold on mutants lacking polysaccharide capsule. In S. pyogenes, surface exposure of Slr was not affected in a mutant lacking hyaluronic acid capsule but was increased >20-fold in mutants lacking M protein or protein F. Thus, both Blr and Slr are efficiently camouflaged by other surface structures on bacteria grown in vitro. When Blr and Slr exposed on the bacterial surface were compared, they exhibited only little immunological cross-reactivity, in spite of extensive residue identity, suggesting that their surface-exposed parts have been under evolutionary pressure to diverge functionally and/or antigenically. These data identify a family of immunologically diverse streptococcal LRR proteins that show unexpected complexity in their interactions with other bacterial surface components.
TI  - Lack of mitogenic activity of speG- and speG(dys)-positive Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates from patients with invasive infections.
AB  - In recent years, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis has been isolated with an increasing frequency as the cause of invasive streptococcal diseases. For 46 S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates from invasive infections and four isolates from superficial infections, the presence of emm/emmL genes and of genes encoding various different streptococcal superantigens was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Subsequently, PCR products were identified by DNA sequencing, and the expression of mRNA from superantigen genes was assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The mitogenic activity of S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation into human lymphocytes and compared with that of Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes. All S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates studied harbored an emm/emmL gene. Only in six of the S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates from invasive infections, speG was detected by PCR, two of which were further identified as speGdys by sequencing of the PCR product. None of the S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates harbored any of the genes speA, speB, speC, speF, speH, speI, speJ, speK, speL, speM, smeZ, or ssa of S. pyogenes. In contrast to S. pyogenes, no expression of speG or speGdys mRNA, respectively, was detected in the reverse transcriptase-PCR assay for any of the speG- or speGdys-positive S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis isolates. Moreover, S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis and S. agalactiae revealed no or very low mitogenic activity, while S. pyogenes was a very powerful inducer of proliferative responses. These findings support the hypothesis that the pathogenicity of S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis may be associated in part with the presence of emm/emmL genes, and suggest that the severity of S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis invasive infections is not mediated by superantigen-induced mitogenicity.
TI  - Ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  - Although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. Syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. To investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including E. faecalis, E. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. Streptococcus bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis showed increased adherence to ARH-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. Heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of S. bovis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus by HT-29 enterocytes (prominent syndecan-1 expression), but not Caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). Data from experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells with altered glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. Thus, although E. faecalis, E. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical, and trauma patients.
TI  - Evaluation of the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System SMIC/ID panel for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System SMIC/ID panel was evaluated for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of various streptococci. A group of 97 consecutive clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 23 Streptococcus pyogenes, 24 Streptococcus agalactiae, and 34 viridans streptococci were collected and comparisons made with routine manual methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Overall, in 162 (91%) of 178 isolates, Phoenix identification results demonstrated agreement. For AST results for the 162 isolates that demonstrated identification concordance, the overall essential agreement rate was 98.5%; the category agreement was 94.9%; and the very major error, major error, and minor error rates were 0%, 0.15%, and 5.8%, respectively. Although relatively high minor error rates were observed with S. pneumoniae and beta-lactams, 79.2% of the 77 minor errors were the result of a single log(2) dilution difference. The Phoenix SMIC/ID panel performed favorably and demonstrated the advantages of automation and simple methodology.
TI  - Putative regulatory gene for polysaccharide synthesis of Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia.
AB  - The DNA sequence of downstream and upstream regions of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis (cps) gene cluster of Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia was determined. The overall structure of this region is very similar to a portion of the genome of S. pyogenes, although S. pyogenes does not contain cps genes. In the upstream region, a putative regulatory gene was identified and designated as cpsIaR. From the similarity of the amino acid sequences, the gene product seems to belong to an LysR family of transcriptional regulatory proteins. cpsIaR seems to be transcribed in the direction opposite to cps genes from two different but closely positioned promoters. GST-fused CpsIaR protein binds to the cpsIaA promoter region, suggesting that the protein controls the expression of cpsIa gene cluster.
TI  - [Resistance of mastitis pathogens in northern Germany].
AB  - The data of 1692 susceptibility tests acquired from April 2003 through March 2004 in the mastitis laboratory of the Institute for Food Quality and Safety were summarized in order to help veterinarians confronted with acute mastitis in choosing the appropriate antibiotic. Two thirds of the milk samples were infected with gram-positive cocci. One third of these were identified as Streptococcus (S.) uberis, one fourth as Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. All isolates (100%) of S. uberis, S. dysgalactiae, S. agalactiae and Arcanobacterium pyogenes were susceptible to Penicillin and Ampicillin. Concering S. aureus, nearly 100% of the isolates were susceptible to Oxacillin, Cephalothin, Cefacetril, Cefquinom and Neomycin, but only 88% of the isolates were sensitive to Penicillin, Ampicillin and Cefoperazon. The gram-negative rods (Escherichia (E.) coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp.) displayed an irregular resistance pattern. More than 93% of all examined isolates including Pseudomonas spp. were susceptible to Colistin. The sensitivity of E. coli and Klebsiella spp.to Marbofloxacin, Enrofloxacin and Cefquinom exceeded 96%. Thus, the susceptibility of gram-positive mastitis pathogens to common antibiotics is favourable. Because the highly effective Colistin is no longer approved for local therapy, the situation for gram-negative bacteria is more difficult.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human American tegumentary leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
AB  - An evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. Microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. A total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type B (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type C (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). Proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), H(2)S-negative Proteus species (19.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), Enterobacter species (9.5%), Peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), Pseudomonas species (4.8%), Prevotella bivia (4.8%), Escherichia coli (4.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), Candida albicans (9.5%) and Candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. Surprisingly, Staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). Concerning obligate anaerobes, all the Gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. The results of the present study show that microbial secondary contaminants, particularly Staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of ATL lesions.
TI  - Evaluation of the BD Phoenix SMIC/ID, a new streptococci identification and antimicrobial susceptibility panel, for potential routine use in a university-based clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  - We evaluated the new BD Phoenix automated microbiology system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) SMIC/ID-4 panel for routine identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of streptococci in a university-based laboratory. Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 92), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 24), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 10) were collected, and comparisons were made with the routine manual methods used in our microbiology laboratory for ID and susceptibility testing. ID concordance with manual methods was 85.9%, 95.8%, and 90.0% for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. agalactiae, respectively. With respect to AST concordance for S. pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae) using Phoenix and standard broth microdilution panels, overall essential agreement was 93.0% and 97.5%, respectively, whereas overall category agreement was 92.4% and 98.9%, respectively. Major and minor error rates for S. pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococci were 0.5% and 0.3%, and 7.1% and 0.8%, respectively. Very major errors were not observed in this study. Mean time for ID and AST test completion was 13.6 +/- 1.6, 10.7 +/- 2.4, and 11.2 +/- 2.3 h for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. agalactiae, respectively. We have demonstrated that Phoenix ID results show high agreement with manual ID and that AST performance was equivalent to standard broth microdilution in less time.
TI  - Pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers: novel sequence-selective, DNA-interactive, cross-linking agents with activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) dimers are synthetic sequence-selective interstrand DNA minor-groove cross-linking agents developed from anthramycins. We investigated the antibacterial activity of three dimers, SJG-136, DRG-16 and ELB-21, which differ in the structure of the PBD monomeric unit and the length of the linker region between the two identical PBD monomers. METHODS: MICs were determined against 38 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 20 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), 12 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 12 of Streptococcus agalactiae, 12 of Listeria monocytogenes and 24 Gram-negative clinical isolates. Binding to double-stranded DNA was assessed by determination of the DNA melting temperature (T(m)). RESULTS: MIC(90) values for SJG-136 were 0.5 mg/L against MRSA, VRE and L. monocytogenes, 0.06 mg/L against S. pyogenes and 0.03 mg/L against S. agalactiae; these were below the maximum tolerated dose of the drug. MIC(90)s for DRG-16 were 0.125, >0.5, 0.125, 0.015 and <0.008 mg/L, respectively. The most potent compound was ELB-21, with corresponding MIC(90) values of 0.03, 0.06, 0.06, 0.015 and 0.015 mg/L. There was little or no variation in sensitivity amongst isolates from any one species. All Gram-negative species (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Proteus spp.) were not susceptible due to the barrier function of the outer membrane. PBD dimers showed bactericidal activity against MRSA and VRE and there was a significant post-antibiotic effect (1.5--3.5 h). Incubation of EMRSA-16 genomic DNA (50 microM) with 20 microM ELB-21 resulted in a large increase in T(m) suggesting that PBD dimers exert their antibacterial effect by cross-linking of the two DNA strands. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that this novel class of antibacterial agents warrants further investigation as potential antibiotics for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Group B streptococcal soft tissue infections in non-pregnant adults.
AB  - Skin and soft tissue infections are the most common presentations of invasive Streptococcus agalactiae infections. This study reviewed 71 patients in a medical centre in southern Taiwan with S. agalactiae soft tissue infections. The mortality rate was 7%, and 11% of patients lost their extremities following extensive tissue necrosis. Critical illness and the presence of cutaneous ulceration heralded a fatal prognosis. Risk-factors for amputation of limbs included advanced age, cutaneous ulceration and polymicrobial infection. It was concluded that invasive S. agalactiae soft tissue infections, as with infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, can also lead to substantial morbidity and mortality in non-pregnant adults.
TI  - Invasive group A, B, C and G streptococcal infections in Denmark 1999-2002: epidemiological and clinical aspects.
AB  - Group A streptococci (GAS) have been described frequently as an emerging cause of severe invasive infections in population-based surveillance studies, whereas the descriptions of group B, C and G streptococci (GBS, GCS and GGS) have been less frequent. Enhanced surveillance for invasive GAS, GBS, GCS and GGS was performed in Denmark in 1999-2002. A detailed questionnaire was completed for 1237 (98%) of 1260 invasive infections. GAS infections dominated (40%), followed by GGS (32%), GBS (23%) and GCS (6%). Most (74%) patients had predisposing factors, and there were no significant differences between the four serogroups when comparing the prevalence of cancer, diabetes mellitus, chronic heart or lung diseases, immunodeficiency or alcohol abuse. The overall case fatality rate at day 30 was 21%, increasing significantly to 59% for patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). STSS was significantly more frequent in GAS patients (10%) than in GCS (4%), GBS (2%) and GGS (2%) patients. Regression analyses showed that, despite a younger median age among GAS patients, the probability of developing septic shock and mortality was significantly higher among GAS patients than among GBS and GGS patients. These analyses showed no significant differences between GAS and GCS infections. Invasive infections caused by GAS, GBS, GCS and GGS are still a major challenge for clinicians. Continued epidemiological and microbiological surveillance is important to assess the development of these infections and to improve preventative strategies.
TI  - Inter-species genetic movement may blur the epidemiology of streptococcal diseases in endemic regions.
AB  - Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (human group G streptococcus, GGS)  is generally regarded as a commensal organism but can cause a spectrum of human diseases very similar to that caused by S. pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS). Lateral acquisition of genes between these two phylogenetically closely related species is well documented. However, the extent and mechanisms of lateral acquisitions is not known. We report here genomic subtraction between a pathogenic GGS isolate and a community GGS isolate and analyses of the gene sequences unique to the pathovar. Our results show that cross-species genetic transfers are common between GGS and two closely related human pathogens, GAS and the group B streptococcus. We also demonstrate that mobile genetic elements, such as phages and transposons, play an important role in the ongoing inter-species transfers of genetic traits between extant organisms in the community. Furthermore, lateral gene transfers between GAS and GGS may occur more frequently in geographical regions of high GAS endemicity. These observations may have important implications in understanding the epidemiology of streptococcal diseases in such regions.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (CCL), cefroxadine (CXD), cefdinir (CFDN), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefteram (CFTM), cefcapene (CFPN), and cefditoren (CDTR), against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and ESBL-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in Kansai Medical University Hospital between 2002 and 2003. Based on the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above MIC (TAM) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. In S. pneumoniae strains, the MIC(50,80,90) values of CDTR were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the most potent antimicrobial activity. However, the efficacy rate for CDTR calculated based on the PK/PD theory was 58.5%. CFTM showed the highest efficacy rate (66.1%). In H. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of CDTR was most potent, followed by that of CFTM and that of CFPN/CFIX. The MIC90 value of CDTR was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of CFTM (0.5 microg/ml). The efficacy rate for CDTR was 100%. This result supports that CDTR frequently eradicates H. influenzae. In E. coli strains, the MIC90 values of the above agents, excluding CCL and CXD, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activity of CFIX against K. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of CFDN/CPDX and that of CFTM. In ESBL-producing bacteria, most agents showed an MIC90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. In S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory MIC values. In methi- cillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, CFDN and CXD showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. The frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. ESBL-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be readily evaluated. However, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. In S. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the PK/PD theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. Thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the PK/PD theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.
TI  - Characterization of a novel leucine-rich repeat protein antigen from group B streptococci that elicits protective immunity.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) usually behave as commensal organisms that asymptomatically colonize the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts of adults. However, GBS are also pathogens and the leading bacterial cause of life-threatening invasive disease in neonates. While the events leading to transmission and disease in neonates remain unclear, GBS carriage and level of colonization in the mother have been shown to be significant risk factors associated with invasive infection. Surface antigens represent ideal vaccine targets for eliciting antibodies that can act as opsonins and/or inhibit colonization and invasion. Using a genetic screen for exported proteins in GBS, we identified a gene, designated lrrG, that encodes a novel LPXTG anchored surface antigen containing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs found in bacterial invasins and other members of the LRR protein family. Southern blotting showed that lrrG was present in all GBS strains tested, representing the nine serotypes, and revealed the presence of an lrrG homologue in Streptococcus pyogenes. Recombinant LrrG protein was shown in vitro to adhere to epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that it may function as an adhesion factor in GBS. More importantly, immunization with recombinant LrrG elicited a strong immunoglobulin G response in CBA/ca mice and protected against lethal challenge with virulent GBS. The data presented in this report suggest that this conserved protein is a highly promising candidate antigen for use in a GBS vaccine.
TI  - Regulation of virulence by a two-component system in group B streptococcus.
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is frequently carried in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract as a commensal organism, yet it has the potential to cause life-threatening infection in newborn infants, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic illness. Regulation of virulence factor expression may affect whether GBS behaves as an asymptomatic colonizer or an invasive pathogen, but little is known about how such factors are controlled in GBS. We now report the characterization of a GBS locus that encodes a two-component regulatory system similar to CsrRS (or CovRS) in Streptococcus pyogenes. Inactivation of csrR, encoding the putative response regulator, in two unrelated wild-type strains of GBS resulted in a marked increase in production of beta-hemolysin/cytolysin and a striking decrease in production of CAMP factor, an unrelated cytolytic toxin. Quantitative RNA hybridization experiments revealed that these two phenotypes were associated with a marked increase and decrease in expression of the corresponding genes, cylE and cfb, respectively. The CsrR mutant strains also displayed increased expression of scpB encoding C5a peptidase. Similar, but less marked, changes in gene expression were observed in CsrS (putative sensor component) mutants, evidence that CsrR and CsrS constitute a functional two-component system. Experimental infection studies in mice demonstrated reduced virulence of both CsrR and CsrS mutant strains relative to the wild type. Together, these results indicate that CsrRS regulates expression of multiple GBS virulence determinants and is likely to play an important role in GBS pathogenesis.
TI  - Surveillance of linezolid resistance in Germany, 2001-2002.
AB  - A surveillance study was performed throughout Germany from November 2001 to June  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among Gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. Each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. Most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. Laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for MIC determination. Susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. Sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). Routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. The prevalence of linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in Enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in Enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in Streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid resistance was not detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae or in viridans group streptococci. Sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. Linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (MIC90, 1-2 mg/L). The prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in Germany. Organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an alternative method or in a reference laboratory.
TI  - Prevalence and mechanisms of erythromycin resistance in group A and group B Streptococcus: implications for reporting susceptibility results.
AB  - Increased rates of erythromycin resistance among group B Streptococcus (GBS) and  group A Streptococcus (GAS) have been reported. Cross-resistance to clindamycin may be present, depending on the mechanism of resistance. We determined the prevalence of macrolide-resistant determinants in GBS and GAS isolates to guide the laboratory reporting of erythromycin and clindamycin susceptibility. Susceptibilities were determined by the disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. Inducible and constitutive resistance to clindamycin was determined by the double-disk diffusion method. The presence of the ermTR, ermB, and mefA genes was confirmed by PCR. Of the 338 GBS isolates, 55 (17%) were resistant to erythromycin, whereas 26 (8%) were resistant to clindamycin. The erm methylase gene was identified in 48 isolates, 22 of which had inducible resistance to clindamycin and 26 of which had constitutive resistance to clindamycin. The remaining seven resistant isolates had mefA. Of the 593 GAS isolates, 49 (8%) and 6 (1%) isolates were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively. Erythromycin resistance was due to mefA in 33 isolates, whereas 14 isolates had erm-mediated resistance (9 isolates had inducible resistance and 5 isolates had constitutive resistance). In our population, erythromycin resistance in GAS was predominantly mediated by mefA and erythromycin resistance in GBS was predominantly mediated by erm. Regional differences in mechanisms of resistance need to be taken into consideration when deciding whether to report clindamycin susceptibility results on the basis of in vitro test results. Testing by the double-disk diffusion method would be an approach that could be used to address this issue, especially for GAS.
TI  - CovS/CovR of group B streptococcus: a two-component global regulatory system involved in virulence.
AB  - In this study, we carried out a detailed structural and functional analysis of a  Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) two-component system which is orthologous to the CovS/CovR (CsrS/CsrR) regulatory system of Streptococcus pyogenes. In GBS, covR and covS are part of a seven gene operon transcribed from two promoters that are not regulated by CovR. A DeltacovSR mutant was found to display dramatic phenotypic changes such as increased haemolytic activity and reduced CAMP activity on blood agar. Adherence of the DeltacovSR mutant to epithelial cells was greatly increased and analysis by transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence at its surface of a fibrous extracellular matrix that might be involved in these intercellular interactions. However, the DeltacovSR mutant was unable to initiate growth in RPMI and its viability in human normal serum was greatly impaired. A major finding of this phenotypic analysis was that the CovS/CovR system is important for GBS virulence, as a 3 log increase of the LD(50) of the mutant strain was observed in the neonate rat sepsis model. The pleiotropic phenotype of the DeltacovSR mutant is in full agreement with the large number of genes controlled by CovS/CovR as seen by expression profiling analysis, many of which encode potentially secreted or cell surface-associated proteins: 76 genes are repressed whereas 63 were positively regulated. CovR was shown to bind directly to the regulatory regions of several of these genes and a consensus CovR recognition sequence was proposed using both DNase I footprinting and computational analyses.
TI  - ISSag1 in streptococcal strains of human and animal origin.
AB  - The chromosomal region of Streptococcus agalactiae harboring the C5a peptidase and the lmb genes displays the structure of a composite transposon. Its presence in a streptococcal strain is associated with the origin of this strain from a human host. In S. agalactiae it is flanked by two copies of the insertion element ISSag2, and the nucleotide sequence for a third IS element (ISSag1) can be found in this region. Based on amino acid sequence similarity of the deduced transposase ISSag1 belongs to the IS3 family. It is 1251 bp long and flanked by 37 bp imperfect inverted repeats. Horizontal gene transfer among different bacterial species is facilitated by mobile genetic elements. To investigate if ISSag1 homologues are also present in other streptococcal species, various species of pyogenic streptococci from animal and human origin were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and PCR. Among the different streptococcal species, multiple copies of an ISSag1 homologue could only be detected in S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae strains of animal origin. All of the S. agalactiae strains harbored only a single copy, that was always found in strains with the scpB-lmb composite transposon. A single copy of an ISSag1 homologue could also be detected in some of the S. pyogenes and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strains. Nucleotide sequencing of the IS element in S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae strains revealed several different variants. One of the variants showed the features of a regular IS3 element. The other two variants that were observed displayed a 500-bp deletion and a mosaic structure composed of ISSag1 and ISSag2 homologues. This mosaic structure suggests that recombination and horizontal gene transfer events in S. dysgalactiae strains of bovine origin could have played a role in the assembly of the scpB-lmb composite transposon structure.
TI  - Daptomycin - a novel antibiotic against Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Daptomycin is a novel member of a new class of antimicrobial agents used in treating resistant Gram-positive infections. These infections are becoming more commonplace and treatment options are limited. At present, daptomycin is approved for use in the US for complicated skin and skin-structure infections that are a common complication of surgery, diabetic foot ulcers, and burns. The most common causative organisms in these types of infections are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Group C and G streptococci. Traditionally, these infections have been treated with penicillin and cephalosporins, but resistance to these agents is widespread and increasing. Of particular concern is the rapid increase in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme reported that approximately 30% of S. aureus isolates from skin and skin-structure infections were MRSA. The standard treatment for MRSA infections is vancomycin but resistance to this agent is also developing. There is a continuing need for the development of new antibiotics with Gram-positive activity, to combat multi-drug-resistant Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Immunization with C5a peptidase from either group A or B streptococci enhances clearance of group A streptococci from intranasally infected mice.
AB  - Group A streptococci (S. pyogenes) are responsible for pharyngitis, impetigo and  several more serious diseases. Emergence of toxic shock, and necrotizing fasciitis, associated with this pathogen over the past 10 years, has generated interest in development of a vaccine, which would prevent infections and potential serious complications. The highly conserved C5a peptidase that is expressed on the surface of group A streptococcus and other streptococcal species, associated with human infections, is a prime vaccine candidate. Here, we report construction of an inactive form of the peptidase and test its potential to induce protection in mice from intranasal challenge with either serotype M1 and M49 strains of streptococci. Mice were immunized by subcutaneous administration of recombinant proteins, mixed with Alum and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvants. Control mice were vaccinated with tetanus toxoid in the same adjuvants. Preparations of SCPA protein were highly immunogenic in mice. Antibody directed against protein from either group A (SCPAw) or group B (SCPBw) streptococci neutralized activity associated with both enzymes. Streptococci were cleared from the oral-nasal mucosa of mice immunized with vaccine protein more rapidly than those immunized with tetanus toxoid. Moreover, immunization with either protein enhanced clearance of group A streptococci from the lung. These results suggest that parenteral vaccination with SCPBw protein will provide protection against infection by either group A or B streptococci.
TI  - [Evaluation of Prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].
AB  - The need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to identify streptococcal group antigens (A, B, C, D, F, and G) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. The Prolex agglutination tests (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada), distributed in France by i2a, have been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the National Reference Center for Streptococci. The results obtained with the Prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 Streptococcus pyogenes, 21 Streptococcus agalactiae, 33 Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group C and 27 group G, and 5 Streptococcus porcinus including 4 group B). Four differences between unexpected agglutinations (A or F) and species identifications have been obtained. These differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantarius, and Streptococcus suis. The anti-D reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. Thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. Moreover, the use of Prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens.
TI  - Bacterial capsular polysaccharide and sugar transferases.
AB  - Capsular polysaccharides (CPs) of several pathogenic bacteria are thought to be good materials for the development of new therapeutic reagents. These polysaccharides can be used as vaccines against infection of pathogenic bacteria and are also useful as inhibitors for disease caused by aberrant and abnormal cell-cell interaction, such as cancer metastasis and inflammation. Since bacterial CPs are diverse in structure and these bacteria have a variety of sugar transferases responsible for the synthesis of CPs, bacterial CP synthesis (cps) genes have attracted much interest as a source of glycosyltransferases useful for glycoengineering. In this review, we describe physiological effects of the bacterial CPs on mammalian cells, and the structure and function of the cps genes, by focusing on group B streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae type Ia and Ib, that produce high-molecular weight polysaccharides consisting of the following pentasaccharide repeating units: -->4)-[alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->3)]-beta-D -Galp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1--> and -->4)-[alpha-D-NeupNAc-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->3)-beta-D-GlcpNAc-(1-->3)]-beta-D -Galp-(1-->4)beta-D-Glcp-(1-->, respectively.
TI  - Macrolide resistance in beta-hemolytic streptococci: changes after the implementation of the separation of prescribing and dispensing of medications policy in Korea.
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibilities and macrolide resistance  mechanisms of beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS), and an additional objective was to assess the effects of 'the separation of prescribing and dispensing (SPD) of medications' on bacterial resistance rate and distribution of phenotypes and genotypes of erythromycin-resistant BHS by comparing the antimicrobial susceptibility data before (1990- 2000) and after the implementation of SPD at one tertiary care hospital in South Korea. Between the period of January 2001 and December 2002, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of six antimicrobials were determined for 249 clinical isolates of BHS. Resistance mechanisms of erythromycin-resistant (intermediate and resistant) isolates were studied by using the double disk test and PCR. Overall, the resistance rates to tetracycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin were 75.5%, 32.9%, and 32.5%, respectively. Sixty-seven (81.7%) of 82 erythromycin- resistant isolates expressed constitutive resistance to macrolide- lincosamide-streptogramin B antibiotics (a constitutive MLSB phenotype); 11 isolates (13.4%) expressed an M phenotype; and four isolates (4.9%) had an inducible MLSB resistance phenotype. erm(A) was found in isolates with constitutive/ inducible MLSB phenotypes, erm(B) with the constitutive/ inducible MLSB phenotype, and mef(A) with the M phenotype. We found that resistance rates to erythromycin and clindamycin among S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and group C streptococci isolates were still high after the implementation of the SPD policy in Korea, and that the constitutive MLSB resistance phenotype was dominant among erythromycin- resistant BHS in this Korean hospital.
TI  - Comparative genomics of streptococcal species.
AB  - Microbial genome sequencing has produced an unprecedented amount of new information and insights into an organism's metabolic activities, virulence properties, and evolution. The complete genome sequence has been reported for four different species of streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and S. mutans. Comparative genome analysis among organisms of the same species not only shows a high degree of similarity in gene content and organization, but also a high degree of sequence heterogeneity as evidenced by the large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms present. Considerable differences were also observed in the number of mobile genetic elements found in each organism, including complete and partial bacteriophage genomes, IS elements, transposons, and plasmids. S. pyogenes was the only species to contain complete bacteriophage genomes in its genome, while only S. pneumoniae and S. mutans contained the full complement of competence genes essential for natural transformation. Comparative genome analysis between the species showed that S. pyogenes was more closely related to S. agalactiae than with S. pneumoniae or S. mutans.
TI  - Susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway.
AB  - A total of 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), Streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by E-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. Subgroups of oxacillin resistant S. aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MIC5o and MIC9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, MIC range 0.12-2 mg/l). Staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (MIC54, and MIC90 0.25-2 mg/l, MIC range 0.125-2 mg/l). Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 4.0 mg/l) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50 = 8.0 mg/l, MIC90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. There was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. The study demonstrated a high prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in Norway.
TI  - Zebrafish as a model host for streptococcal pathogenesis.
AB  - Streptococcal pathogens continue to evade concerted efforts to determine clear-cut virulence mechanisms, although numerous genes have been implicated in pathogenesis. A single species can infect a diversity of tissues, suggesting the expression of specific virulence factors based on the local tissue environment or stage of infection. In an effort to identify the interactions that occur between the host and pathogen that lead to activation of virulence mechanisms and contribute to specific streptococcal disease states, we have developed a unique animal model, the zebrafish (Danio rerio), to characterize specific virulence mechanisms utilized within various tissues in vivo. We are using this model host to study infection by two streptococcal species that represent two forms of streptococcal disease: a natural pathogen of fish and humans, Streptococcus iniae and a human-specific pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes. S. iniae primarily causes a fatal systemic disease in the zebrafish following intra-muscular injection, with similar pathologies to that seen in human infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and S. pneumoniae. While the fatal infection by S. pyogenes causes a locally spreading necrotic disease confined to the muscle with pathology similar to what is observed in a human infection of necrotizing fasciitis. By studying pathogens that are virulent for both fish and humans and that mediate disease states in the zebrafish that are identical to those found in human streptococcal infections, we will be able to identify common virulence strategies shared by a number of Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability assessment of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media.
AB  - Young children contract as many as six to eight upper respiratory tract viral infections per year, and these infections frequently lead to secondary bacterial infections such as acute otitis media and sinusitis. Cefprozil is an orally active third generation cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against the gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicilin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Cefprozil is also active against various gram-ves and certain anaerobic organisms, and is stable to hydrolysis by a number of b-lactamases. Present study is an effort to study the efficacy and safety of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media. Three hundred and thirty four children aged 6 months through 12 years with clinical symptoms and tympanic membrane signs of AOM received cefprozil 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses per day for 10 days. Clinically, 96.6% patients were cured, 2.4% improved and there was failure of therapy in 1% of the patients. There was no need for any rescue medication and any change in antibiotic in any patient. A satisfactory bacteriological outcome was (i.e. cure, presumed cure, and cure plus reinfection with a different pathogen) was achieved in 95% of patients. In conclusion, cefprozil is a well tolerated and effective drug for acute otitis media in children. Moreover, its expanded spectrum of activity, ability to achieve adequate concentrations in tissues, suitability for twice-daily dosing, and proven tolerability suggest that it is a better alternative to agents conventionally used in acute otitis media.
TI  - The pathogenesis of streptococcal infections: from tooth decay to meningitis.
AB  - The development of bacterial disease has been likened to a 'molecular arms race', in which the host tries to eliminate the bacteria, while the bacteria try to survive in the host. Although most bacteria do not cause disease, some cause serious human infection in a large proportion of encounters. Between these two extremes are bacteria that can coexist with humans in a carriage state but, under appropriate circumstances, cause disease. The streptococci exemplify this group of organisms, and by studying them we can begin to address why bacteria cause such a wide spectrum of disease.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the peptide deformylase inhibitor BB-83698.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: BB-83698 is a peptide deformylase inhibitor currently in clinical trials in Europe. The purpose of this study was to provide additional susceptibility data from clinical isolates, including drug-resistant strains. METHODS: The in vitro activities of BB-83698 and comparators were determined against 281 streptococci, 154 Staphylococcus aureus, 110 Haemophilus influenzae and 50 Moraxella catarrhalis strains selected for their resistance phenotypes. Broth microdilution MICs and MBCs were determined according to NCCLS guidelines. RESULTS: The MIC90s were 0.25-0.5 mg/L for S. pneumoniae, including penicillin-, erythromycin-, levofloxacin- and multidrug-resistant strains. The MIC90s for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.12 mg/L and for viridans streptococci, the MIC90 was 0.5 mg/L. Against S. aureus, including oxacillin- and levofloxacin-resistant strains, and vancomycin-intermediate strains, the MIC90 was 8 mg/L. Against beta-lactamase-negative and -positive H. influenzae, the MIC90s were 32 and 64 mg/L, respectively, and against both beta-lactamase-negative and -positive M. catarrhalis the MIC90 was 0.12 mg/L. In MBC studies, the ratio of MBC/MIC was 1:1 or 2:1 against 31% of S. pneumoniae, 33% of S. aureus, 63% of H. influenzae and 9% of M. catarrhalis. CONCLUSIONS: Although BB-83698 has reduced in vitro activity against H. influenzae, it is a potent antimicrobial with excellent activity against streptococci and Moraxella.
TI  - Daptomycin.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibacterial with rapid in vitro activity against Gram-positive cocci. It is approved for use in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) caused by specified Gram-positive cocci. In vitro, daptomycin was active against Staphylococcus aureus (including meticillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, group C and G beta-haemolytic streptococci and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis. Bactericidal activity in vitro was rapid and concentration dependent. In two randomised, investigator-blinded, multicentre trials in patients with cSSSIs, intravenous daptomycin 4 mg/kg once daily was as effective as standard therapy (intravenous semi-synthetic penicillin 4-12 g/day or vancomycin 1 g 12-hourly). Clinical success rates assessed 6-20 days after treatment end were 82.1% in daptomycin recipients and 82.9% in recipients of standard therapy (pooled data). In patients with cSSSIs, the adverse event profiles of daptomycin and vancomycin were similar. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels increased in 2.8% of daptomycin recipients and 1.8% of patients who received standard therapy; only one daptomycin recipient (0.2%) experienced increased CPK levels and muscle symptoms that were not associated with any comorbid factors.
TI  - Construction of a GBS-GAS DNA subtraction library allows discovery of previously  unidentified GBS genes and rapid location of unique regions on the GBS chromosome.
AB  - A subtraction library of group B streptococcus (GBS) strain O9OR with GAS chromosomal DNA (strain SF370) was constructed and more than 100 plasmid clones sequenced. DNA sequences of the plasmid inserts were analyzed using the BLAST gene search. Most inserts had little or no homology to GAS chromosomal DNA and 26 clones from the library had no gene homologues in the gene bank. The majority of genes discovered represented house keeping GBS genes, but several could be considered as possible virulence factors. Inserts from 21 clones were labeled and used as probes for hybridization with GBS DNA fragments separated by pulsed field electrophoresis. A genetic map of GBS strain O9OR was constructed.
TI  - rpoB gene sequence-based identification of aerobic Gram-positive cocci of the genera Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Abiotrophia, and Granulicatella.
AB  - We developed a new molecular tool based on rpoB gene (encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. We first sequenced the complete rpoB gene for Streptococcus anginosus, S. equinus, and Abiotrophia defectiva. Sequences were aligned with these of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae available in GenBank. Using an in-house analysis program (SVARAP), we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and, by using these conserved zones as PCR primer targets, we amplified and sequenced this variable region in an additional 30 Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Granulicatella, and Abiotrophia species. This region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. We therefore applied our identification system by PCR amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. Amplicons were obtained in streptococci and Bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. Molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the S. pneumoniae-S. oralis-S. mitis group and the S. agalactiae-S. difficile group. These signatures allowed us to design a S. pneumoniae-specific PCR and sequencing primer pair.
TI  - In vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide derivative exhibiting innovative microbiological properties against well-characterised antibiotic resistant pathogens in Italy.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. ABT773 was active (MIC-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were also inhibited (MIC-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. Enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to ABT773 with the exception of VanA mutants. E. faecium showed poor susceptibility to ABT773. The activity of the new ketolide against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. ABT773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.
TI  - L-ficolin specifically binds to lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall constituent of Gram-positive bacteria, and activates the lectin pathway of complement.
AB  - The lectin pathway of complement is activated when a carbohydrate recognition complex and associated serine proteases binds to the surface of a pathogen. Three recognition subcomponents have been shown to form active initiation complexes: mannan-binding lectin (MBL), L-ficolin, and H-ficolin. The importance of MBL in antimicrobial host defense is well recognized, but the role of the ficolins remains largely undefined. This report shows that L-ficolin specifically binds to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell wall component found in all Gram-positive bacteria. Immobilized LTA from Staphylococcus aureus binds L-ficolin complexes from sera, and these complexes initiate lectin pathway-dependent C4 turnover. C4 activation correlates with serum L-ficolin concentration, but not with serum MBL levels. L-ficolin binding and corresponding levels of C4 turnover were observed on LTA purified from other clinically important bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. None of the LTA preparations bound MBL, H-ficolin, or the classical pathway recognition molecule, C1q.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline against erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae: mechanisms of macrolide and tetracycline resistance.
AB  - The activity of tigecycline was tested against erythromycin-resistant streptococci (107 Streptococcus pyogenes and 98 Streptococcus agalactiae strains). The presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes was determined by PCR. Among S. pyogenes strains the most prevalent gene was mef(A) (91.6%). The erm(B) gene was the most prevalent (65.3%) among S. agalactiae strains. Tigecycline proved to be very active against all the isolates tested (MIC at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited, 0.06 micro g/ml), including those resistant to tetracycline.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - Heat shock treatment increases the frequency of loss of an erythromycin resistance-encoding transposable element from the chromosome of Lactobacillus crispatus CHCC3692.
AB  - A 3,165-bp chromosomally integrated transposon, designatedTn3692, of the gram-positive strain Lactobacillus crispatus CHCC3692 contains an erm(B) gene conferring resistance to erythromycin at concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml. Loss of this resistance can occur spontaneously, but the rate is substantially increased by heat shock treatment. Heat shock treatment at 60 degrees C resulted in an almost 40-fold increase in the frequency of erythromycin-sensitive cells (erythromycin MIC, 0.047 micrograms/ml). The phenotypic change was followed by a dramatic increase in transcription of the transposase gene and the concomitant loss of an approximately 2-kb DNA fragment carrying the erm(B) gene from the 3,165-bp erm transposon. In cells that were not subjected to heat shock, transcription of the transposase gene was not detectable. The upstream sequence of the transposase gene did not show any homology to known heat shock promoters in the gene data bank. Significant homology (>99%) was observed between the erythromycin resistance-encoding gene from L. crispatus CHCC3692 and the erm(B) genes from other gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, and Lactobacillus reuteri, which strongly indicates a common origin of the erm(B) gene for these species. The transposed DNA element was not translocated to other parts of the genome of CHCC3692, as determining by Southern blotting, PCR analysis, and DNA sequencing. No other major aberrations were observed, as judged by colony morphology, growth performance of the strain, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. These observations suggest that heat shock treatment could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted antibiotic resistance genes harbored in transposons flanked by insertion sequence elements or transposases in lactic acid bacteria used for animal and human food production.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - [Comparative study of three culture media for detecting group B Streptococcus colonization in pregnant women].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of three culture media to detect vaginal and rectal colonization by group B streptococci (GBS) in pregnant women. METHODS: We processed 1334 samples from 861 pregnant women: in 388 patients only vaginal swab was cultured (Group A) and in 473 vaginal and rectal swabs were cultured (Group B). Samples were inoculated on blood agar with colistin-nalidixic acid (BA-CNA), on plates with Granada medium, and on Todd-Hewitt broth (THB) with amikacin followed by subculture in BA-CNA. RESULTS: GBS was isolated in 181 samples (13.6%): 114 vaginal swabs (13.2%) and 67 rectal swabs (14.2%). Among the positive samples, GBS was isolated on BA-CNA in 60.5% of vaginal swabs and in 59.7% of rectal swabs, on Granada medium in 80.7% of vaginal swabs and in 91% of rectal swabs, and on THB in 97.4% of vaginal swabs and in 97% of rectal swabs.We detected 130 GBS carriers, 54 (13.9%) in Group A and 76 (16.1%) in Group B. The percent of carriers detected in groups A and B, respectively, was 59.3% and 75% with BA-CNA, 77.8% and 93.4% with Granada medium, and 96.3% and 97.4% with THB. CONCLUSIONS: THB was the most reliable medium for the detection of GBS. Use of Granada medium allows fast detection of about 87% of carriers. The combination of THB and an initial plate of Granada medium or BA-CNA allows detection of more than 99% of GBS carriers.
TI  - Epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria causing skin and soft tissue infections in the USA and Europe: a guide to appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - Susceptibility data for all organisms associated with a range of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in hospitalised patients were studied. Data were reported by clinical laboratories in the USA, France, Germany, Italy and Spain during 2001 which participate in The Surveillance Network (TSN). Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most prevalent pathogens in all countries. MRSA was detected in 44.4, 34.7, 12.4, 41.8 and 32. 4% of S. aureus in each country, respectively. The majority of MRSA were cross resistant to other compound classes tested except for vancomycin (100% susceptible) trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole with range 1.7% (France) to 15.9% (Italy) resistant, and gentamicin with range 12.2% (France) to 87.0% (Italy) resistant. More than 99.0% of MSSA tested susceptible to ceftriaxone and >94.9% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. 87.2% (France) to 94.6% of MSSA (Germany) were ciprofloxacin susceptible; 73.2% (USA) to 86.6% (Spain) were erythromycin susceptible; 85.4% (Italy) to 99.2% (France) were gentamicin susceptible. MSSA were more frequently found and generally more antibiotic susceptible from out patients. Overall, 100% of Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Macrolide resistance was common among S. agalactiae (20.7%, Germany to 10%, Italy and Spain), S. pyogenes (19.2%, France to 11.1%, USA) and viridans streptococci (25.7%, France to 14.1%, Germany). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were uncommon outside the USA (17.5%) and Italy (7.4%). For all countries susceptibility of E. coli was 100% to imipenem, >98.7% to amikacin, >96.0% to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Susceptibility of E. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin was 77.6% in Spain to 94.3% in Germany. Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. displayed varying susceptibilities between countries to drugs tested. Putative extended spectrum beta-lactamase expression in E. coli remained rare comprising 4-5% of isolates in USA, Italy and Spain and in France and Germany <2%. For P. aeruginosa piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem and ceftazidime were the most active compounds tested irrespective of region. Surveillance data should be considered when selecting empirical therapy for treating SSTI.
TI  - Secondary infections with beta-hemolytic streptococci in skin lesions.
AB  - Secondary infections (SI) in skin lesions are common. In the present study 40 beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 36 patients suffering from SI due to various skin diseases. Staphylococcus aureus coexisted with beta-hemolytic streptococci in 29 of these cases (81%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci were often associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci and gram-positive rods. Eighteen patients (50%) carried beta-hemolytic streptococci predominantly. In most cases of SI due to atopic dermatitis (AD), the predominant species was S. aureus, while in other skin diseases, S. aureus and beta-haemolytica streptococci were predominant in approximately 50% of the patients, except for SI due to tumors and viral diseases. The mean age of patients with SI and beta-hemolytic streptococci was 37 years and that of patients with SI and predominant S. aureus was 32 years. The lower mean age found for S. aureus was due to SI found in patients with AD. This study emphasizes the polymicrobial microbiology of SI.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of macrolides against recent clinical isolates, and analysis of resistant mechanisms].
AB  - We examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), azithromycin (AZM) and rokitamycin (RKM), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. Bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. S. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. Antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as EM and CAM, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide, RKM. By contrast, against S. pneumoniae, RKM was more effective than 14-membered macrolides. Six, three and four strains of S. aureus, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. Thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, MIC of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of EM, CAM or AZM. Isolation frequency of resistant strains to RKM was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides: only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. No resistant strain was recognized in M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae. Further, we analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant strains by the double-disk method. Methylation was major mechanism in S. aureus, and in S. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. In S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.
TI  - Complement resistance mechanisms of streptococci.
AB  - Group A streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes), group B streptococcus (GBS,  Streptococcus agalactiae) and pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae) are all human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. These related species cause different spectra of infections spanning from trivial upper respiratory tract or skin infections to septic and severe diseases. In order to cause deep infections and survive in the human body the bacteria must evade the immune system. Complement is an important part of innate immunity both as an opsonizing and membrane destructing cascade and as an effector system of antibodies. In this review, we describe the complement resistance mechanisms of the three clinically most important streptococcal species, groups A and B streptococci and pneumococcus. The complement evasion mechanisms of these three species are analogous, yet different from one another. Several strains of all three species express molecules (M-proteins, Bac or beta, PspC) that acquire host fluid-phase complement regulators factor H or C4b binding protein to their surfaces. Groups A and B streptococci also secrete proteins and/or enzymes that inhibit the activation of the complement system or chemotaxis caused by the complement activation products. Even though a lot is known about the immune evasion by streptococci, the high morbidity and mortality associated with infections caused by streptococci and the need for efficient vaccines warrant further studies on the streptococcal molecules mediating complement resistance.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - Inter- and intraspecies variations of the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region of various streptococcal species.
AB  - The 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer regions (ISR) of different streptococcal species and subspecies were amplified with primers derived from the highly conserved flanking regions of the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes. The single sized amplicons showed a uniform pattern for S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup C), S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (serogroup G), S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup L), S. canis, S. phocae, S. uberis, S. parauberis, S. pyogenes and S. equi subsp. equi, respectively. The amplicons of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. porcinus and S. suis appeared with 3, 5 and 3 different sizes, respectively. ISR of selected strains of each species or subspecies investigated were sequenced and multiple aligned. This allowed a separation of ISR into regions, with 7 regions for S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup C), S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (serogroup G), S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup L), S. canis, S. phocae, S. pyogenes and S. suis, 8 regions for S. uberis and S. parauberis and mostly 9 regions for S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus and S. porcinus. Region 4, encoding the transfer RNA for alanine (tRNA(Ala)), was present and identical for all isolates investigated. The size and sequence of ISR appears to be a unique marker for streptococci of various species and subspecies and could be used for bacterial identification. In addition the size and sequence variations of ISR of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. porcinus and S. suis allows a molecular typing of isolates of these species possibly useful in epidemiological aspects.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - [Hemolytic streptococcal infections].
AB  
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/mL, which were similar to those in the studies before its marketing. In this study, CPDX showed the decrease in the activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, CPDX maintained good activity. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.
TI  - Various Streptococcus species isolated from infectious skin diseases.
AB  - An evaluation was carried out of the types of Streptococcus spp. (excluding Streptococcus pyogenes) isolated from infectious skin diseases, and their susceptibilities to eight antimicrobial drugs of the Streptococcus spp. isolated. The types of diseases were also evaluated. A total of 29 Streptococcus spp. were identified and Streptococcus agalactiae was the most common. Streptococcus spp. were found to be susceptible to the eight antimicrobials used except gentamicin; susceptibility to gentamicin varied according to species. Susceptibility to beta-lactams was 100% and this drug should be considered the antimicrobial of choice in Streptococcus spp. treatment.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against common clinical isolates in relation to human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with moderate to severe complicated intra-abdominal, complicated skin/skin structure, acute pelvic, or complicated urinary tract infection or community acquired pneumonia was compared to ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and related to known plasma concentrations of the three agents. Ertapenem was more potent against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) than ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam and was more potent and more active than both of these agents against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=1088), Streptococcus pyogenes (n=37), Streptococcus agalactiae (n=48), MSSA (n=187), Haemophilus influenzae (n=59), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n=9) were susceptible to ertapenem; < 1% of 1284 anaerobes and only 1 of 113 Streptococcus pneumoniae (a penicillin-resistant isolate) were resistant to ertapenem. The MIC value at which 90% of all Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, MSSA, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and anaerobes were inhibited (MIC90) was < or = 1 microg/ml and below the mean plasma concentration of total ertapenem following a 1 g intravenous infusion for at least 24 hours, i.e., the entire recommended dosing interval, and below the free drug concentration for at least 8 h.
TI  - Comparison between adult endocarditis due to beta-hemolytic streptococci (serogroups A, B, C, and G) and Streptococcus milleri: a multicenter study in France.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on infective endocarditis (IE) due to Streptococcus milleri (Sm) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (BHS). Because BHS and Sm share some physiologic and pathogenic properties, we wondered whether IE caused by these streptococci might present similarities. METHODS: Through a nationwide retrospective study in France, the medical and microbiologic charts of adults with definite Sm or BHS IE observed between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1996, in university and general hospitals were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients had BHS IE (33 men and 23 women; median age, 59 years; range, 18-91 years) and 29 had Sm IE (18 men and 11 women; median age, 66 years; range, 37-97 years). The BHS group tended to have more underlying medical conditions (46%) and fewer previous cardiopathies (48%) than the Sm group (28% and 71%, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that a longer median time of IE evolution before diagnosis and identification of the presumed portal of entry were independently associated with Sm IE (P<.01). Extracardiac complications were more frequent in the BHS group (55%) than in the Sm group (39%). Comparison of echocardiographic findings between the 2 groups did not establish any statistically significant difference. Thirty-six patients (64%) in the BHS group and 18 (62%) in the Sm group underwent valve replacement. Overall, mortality was 27% for the BHS group and 14% for the Sm group. For all patients, multivariate analysis retained older age as the only significant risk factor for death (P =.01). CONCLUSION: Compared with Sm IE, BHS IE occurs in younger patients with more underlying diseases and fewer underlying cardiopathies and has a more aggressive presentation and evolution.
TI  - Genome sequence of Streptococcus agalactiae, a pathogen causing invasive neonatal disease.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae is a commensal bacterium colonizing the intestinal tract of a significant proportion of the human population. However, it is also a pathogen which is the leading cause of invasive infections in neonates and causes septicaemia, meningitis and pneumonia. We sequenced the genome of the serogroup III strain NEM316, responsible for a fatal case of septicaemia. The genome is 2 211 485 base pairs long and contains 2118 protein coding genes. Fifty-five per cent of the predicted genes have an ortholog in the Streptococcus pyogenes genome, representing a conserved backbone between these two streptococci. Among the genes in S. agalactiae that lack an ortholog in S. pyogenes, 50% are clustered within 14 islands. These islands contain known and putative virulence genes, mostly encoding surface proteins as well as a number of genes related to mobile elements. Some of these islands could therefore be considered as pathogenicity islands. Compared with other pathogenic streptococci, S. agalactiae shows the unique feature that pathogenicity islands may have an important role in virulence acquisition and in genetic diversity.
TI  - Complete genome sequence and comparative genomic analysis of an emerging human pathogen, serotype V Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - The 2,160,267 bp genome sequence of Streptococcus agalactiae, the leading cause of bacterial sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis in neonates in the U.S. and Europe, is predicted to encode 2,175 genes. Genome comparisons among S. agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and the other completely sequenced genomes identified genes specific to the streptococci and to S. agalactiae. These in silico analyses, combined with comparative genome hybridization experiments between the sequenced serotype V strain 2603 V/R and 19 S. agalactiae strains from several serotypes using whole-genome microarrays, revealed the genetic heterogeneity among S. agalactiae strains, even of the same serotype, and provided insights into the evolution of virulence mechanisms.
TI  - Involvement of Lsp, a member of the LraI-lipoprotein family in Streptococcus pyogenes, in eukaryotic cell adhesion and internalization.
AB  - Three open reading frames (ORFs) were identified by a genome walking strategy in  the genomes of serotype M49 group A streptococcal (GAS) strains CS101 and 591. These ORFs were located between the mga core regulon and the dipeptide permease operon. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequences contained signature sequences indicative of a lipoprotein (306 aa), an intracellular protein (823 aa), and a secreted peptide (66 aa), respectively. ORF1 (named Lsp for lipoprotein of Streptococcus pyogenes) and ORF2 exhibited a high degree of homology to the lmb/ORF2 genes of S. agalactiae (B. Spellerberg et al., Infect. Immun. 67:871-878, 1999). The three ORFs were found to be present in each of the 27 GAS serotype strains tested. Transcription analysis revealed a polycistronic lsp/ORF2 and a monocistronic ORF3 message that were detected primarily at the transition from exponential to stationary growth phase. lsp and ORF2 mutants, ORF2- and ORF3-luciferase reporter fusions, and antiserum against recombinant Lsp were produced to examine the biological role of these genes. Although high Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) ion concentrations decreased lsp operon expression, Lsp did not transport divalent cations as described for other LraI-type operons. The lsp mutant had reduced fibronectin binding. Although no direct binding of Lsp to fibronectin could be demonstrated, the lsp mutant showed decreased transcription of prtF2 encoding the fibronectin-binding protein F2. Both the lsp and ORF2 mutants showed decreased laminin binding. Adherence to and internalization into A549 epithelial cells of both mutants was reduced without a detectable effect on eukaryotic cell viability. The transcription of a number of virulence factors was altered in the lsp mutants and ORF2 mutants. The changes in laminin binding and eukaryotic cell internalization could be explained by changes in transcription of speB (cysteine protease) and/or the global regulators mga, csrRS, and nra.
TI  - Antibody to streptococcal cysteine proteinase as a seromarker of group A Streptococcal (Streptococcus pyogenes) infections.
AB  - Serological tests are commonly employed to aid the diagnosis of Streptococcus pyogenes infections, particularly when non-suppurative sequelae are suspected. Conventional laboratory practice is to measure antibody levels to various combinations of the extracellular group A Streptococcus (GAS) antigens streptolysin O (SLO), DNase B, streptokinase and hyaluronidase. Antibody to the extracellular cysteine proteinase streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SPE B) and its precursor zymogen is also produced in response to GAS infections. An indirect hemagglutination test for antibody to zymogen/SPE B was established and evaluated in serum samples from 168 patients with proven (n = 27) or suspected GAS (n = 141) infections, which were also screened for antibodies using the 4 conventional tests. For comparison, sera from 56 patients infected with a variety of other pathogens, as well as sera from 16 patients infected with either S. agalactiae or S. pneumoniae and 34 sera from healthy subjects, were tested. Statistical analysis confirmed that antibody to zymogen/SPE B is a serological marker that can discriminate GAS infections. It can be ranked with the anti-SLO titer, currently the most widely used test, as a marker of an antecedent GAS infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1997-2000).
AB  - Susceptibility patterns of 15 antimicrobial agents were assessed for 3,400 isolates of beta-hemolytic (betahS) and viridans group (VgS) streptococci in the four regions of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program: Asia-Pacific (APAC), Europe (EU), Latin America (LA) and North America (NA). In 1997 through 2000, SENTRY Program monitors tested strains by reference broth microdilution methods and results were interpreted using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria. Among the betahS processed, 81.9% of strains were either Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 650) or S. agalactiae (n = 1,190). The VgS were generally classified as unspeciated alpha-hemolytic streptococci (n = 512; 44%) or S. mitis (n = 254; 22%). Seven quinolones, two beta-lactams, erythromycin (ER), clindamycin (CM), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), vancomycin (VA), teicoplanin (TP) and linezolid (LZ) were tested. Rank order of susceptibility for betahS isolates was: ceftriaxone (CTX) = Q/D = VA = TP = LZ (100.0%) > gatifloxacin (GATI) = trovafloxacin (TROV, 99.8%) > levofloxacin (LEVO; 99.7%) > penicillin (PEN; 99.3%) > grepafloxacin (GREPA; 97.4%) > CM (94.4%) > ER (85.5%). ER versus betahS had the highest MIC(90) values (2 microg/ml) and the lowest susceptibility rates across all regions (range, 81.4% in NA to 97.3% in LA). Among the VgS, susceptibility rank order was: VA = TP = LZ (100.0%) > Q/D (99.1%) > GATI = LEVO = TROVA (98.0%) > GREPA (96.5%) > CTX (92.8%) > CM (90.3%) > PEN (68.6%) > ER (64.5%). Macrolide resistance in both streptococcal species groups of the M-phenotype was highest in the Americas, with erm-patterns predominating in EU and APAC regions. BMS284756 among the monitored new agents showed a four- to eight-fold greater potency versus these streptococcal isolates when compared to the other six tested quinolones. Like Streptococcus pneumoniae, these other streptococci appear to have acquired numerous resistances and require continued surveillance to direct adequate therapies.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Genetic bases and medical relevance of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - Many streptococci are human and/or animal pathogens and the frequent cause of life-threatening diseases. Among various streptococcal virulence factors, capsular polysaccharides (CPs) are recognized as essential to prevent phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. In the last decade, an impressive advance on the knowledge of the genetic bases underlying capsule formation has been achieved. The capsular gene cluster driving the formation of the CP of Streptococcus pyogenes and other hyaluronate-producing streptococci, represents one of the simplest cases of gene organization to synthesize a capsule. A more complex situation has been found in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus suis, and other streptococci. On the whole, there exists a direct relationship between the structural and chemical complexity of the repeating unit of the polysaccharide and the number of genes found in the corresponding capsular locus. Streptococcal vaccines, either polysaccharide or conjugate, are currently being tested in clinical trials to overcome the rise of worldwide antibiotic resistance, although, for different reasons, none of these vaccines are expected to provide the required full coverage in a near future. This concern has prompted to explore alternative possibilities with an improved therapeutic potential against streptococcal diseases.
TI  - Killing of Gram-positive cocci by fatty acids and monoglycerides.
AB  - The susceptibilities of three Gram-positive cocci to medium-chain saturated and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids and their one-monoglycerides were studied. The bacteria were incubated with equal volumes of lipid solutions for 10 min. Lauric acid, palmitoleic acid and monocaprin reduced the number of CFU by 6.0 log10 or greater at 5 mM concentration for streptococci of group A (GAS) and group B (GBS). When further compared at lower concentrations and after longer incubation time monocaprin proved to be the most active. Capric acid showed the highest activity against Staphylococcus aureus at 10 mM. However, at lower concentrations monocaprin was the only lipid that showed significant activity against S. aureus. The mode of action of monocaprin against GBS was studied by a novel two-color fluorescent assay of bacterial viability and by electron microscopy. The results indicate that the bacteria are killed by disintegration of the cell membrane by the lipid, leaving the bacterial cell wall intact. The highly lethal effect of monocaprin indicates that this lipid might be useful as a microbicidal agent for prevention and treatment of infections caused by these bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in Italy. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS-guided MIC methodology. Pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 Streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 Enterococcal isolates, 40 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 Gram-positive and 25 Gram-negative anaerobes. RESULTS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. Similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. Enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. Respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all Gram-negative anaerobes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. This drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
TI  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations and time-kill determination of moxifloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic isolates.
AB  - Moxifloxacin is a new oral 8-methoxy-quinolone with a wide spectrum of activity against Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, atypical micro-organisms and multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. This study was designed to assess the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria with different resistance patterns, anaerobes and atypical micro-organisms such as Chlamydia and Mycoplasma. Moxifloxacin had good activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae with all strains inhibited by < or =0.12 mg/l. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of moxifloxacin for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae ranged from 0.03 to 0.5 mg/l while those of ciprofloxacin were about two- to four-fold higher (MICs=0.12-1 mg/l). Moxifloxacin was poorly active against enterococci but its activity against Clostridium and Bacteroides spp. was in the same range as that of metronidazole and superior to that of clindamycin. Moxifloxacin was substantially more active than both ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Chlamydia.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. tested by Etest.
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecium strains, 23 Enterococcus avium strains, 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 22 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 Streptococcus agalactiae strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of everninomicin were determined by Etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline. The Etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (MIC, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. The antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against MRSA, with an MIC50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml. Against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.
TI  - Trends in serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of group B streptococci isolated in Korea.
AB  - Studies of group B streptococci (GBS) have been limited in Korea, despite the necessity for such studies because of the increase in serious adult infections, the emergence of new serotypes, and the increase of resistance to certain antibiotics. In this study, trends in serotypes of GBS isolated in Korea were compared to determine any changes and emergence of new types, while antimicrobial susceptibility was tested and compared with that of group A streptococci (GAS). It was found that the most frequent infections caused by GBS were of the urinary tract, but other severe infections also occurred not only in newborns but also in adults. The prevalent serotypes were still Ia, Ib, and III, while new serotypes, VI and VIII, also emerged. GBS were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, but were much less so than GAS. The resistance rates to erythromycin and tetracycline were much higher than those in other countries, suggesting that these antibiotics are no longer very useful in Korea for the treatment of GBS infections.
TI  - Sample preparation of Gram-positive bacteria for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.
AB  - A new sample preparation method was developed for fresh, whole-cell Gram-positive bacteria to be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI ToF MS). With fresh, whole-cell Gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family, we had previously achieved spectra consisting of >50 peaks and mass ranges of 2-25 kDa. Because similar spectral quantity could not be achieved for Gram-positive bacteria, using this same protocol, we investigated an alternative approach that focuses on the thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. Gram-positive bacteria were incubated with 0.05-0.5 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min prior to being analyzed by MALDI ToF MS. Lysozyme is an enzymatically stable, 14-kDa protein that specifically cleaves between peptidoglycan disaccharide subunits. A significant increase in overall number of peaks (>50) in the 2-14 kDa range was observed without interference from the presence of lysozyme. We show that for four different species (Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. agalactiae) reproducible subset of peaks were found within spectra from a reference strain and two unrelated clinical isolates. The data suggests that this sample preparation may be useful for increasing the overall number of peaks within spectra for subsequent development of bacterial identification strategies.
TI  - Group A streptococcal puerperal sepsis preceded by positive surveillance cultures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening of pregnant women for vaginal and rectal carriage of group  B streptococci may also identify group A streptococcal carriers. The clinical significance of prenatal group A streptococcal carriage is unknown. CASES: Two women developed group A streptococcal puerperal sepsis after delivery at one hospital 15 months apart. The first patient required hysterectomy and suffered complications including subcapsular hepatic hematoma, pleural effusion, and prolonged ileus. She recovered after a 35-day hospitalization. The second patient had endometritis and recovered. Both had had group A streptococci isolated from vaginal and rectal cultures taken for prenatal group B streptococcal screening. The acute sepsis isolates were both M-type 28, but pulsed-field gel electrophoresis determined that the strains were unrelated. CONCLUSIONS: Finding group A streptococci on prenatal culture may presage serious postpartum infection.

TI  - An in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, E coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group B Streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/mL of gentamicin and toward E coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/mL of gentamicin. CONCLUSION: A low-molecular substance with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.
TI  - Horizontal gene transfer and host specificity of beta-haemolytic streptococci: the role of a putative composite transposon containing scpB and lmb.
AB  - Beta-haemolytic streptococci are important human and animal pathogens: their genetic traits that are associated with the ability to infect human hosts remain, however, unclear. The surface protein, Lmb, mediates the adherence of Streptococcus agalactiae to human laminin. For further analysis of the corresponding gene, the adjacent genomic regions were sequenced. Lmb is localized on a putative composite transposon of 16 kb and is flanked by two copies of a novel insertion sequence element (ISSag2). It harbours the genes scpB and lmb, which are 98% identical with the respective genes of Streptococcus pyogenes. Analysis of the distribution of these genes and ISSag2 among 131 streptococcal strains revealed that all of the human isolates, but only 20% (12 of 61) of the animal isolates, contained scpB and lmb or their homologues. To investigate if the putative transposon can be mobilized, an erythromycin resistance marker was incorporated into the lmb gene of S. agalactiae. Screening for mutant strains with a regained susceptibility for erythromycin identified strains with a deletion of scpB, lmb, and one copy of ISSag2. We hypothesize that a horizontal gene transfer caused the exchange of scpB and lmb and that the ability of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and group C and G streptococcal strains to colonize or infect human hosts is dependent on their presence.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a devestating condition which has been recognized for several years. In North America a recent increase of cases has led to much media attention and public fear. Necrotizing fasciitis may occur as a consequence of infection with Streptococcus pyogenes or as a result of a polymicrobial synergistic infection caused by aerobic, anaerobic, gram positive and gram negative organisms, often in postoperative patients. Necrotizing fasciitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes is mediated by superantigens. The management of necrotizing fasciitis requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis followed by antimicrobial therapy and early surgical intervention. In cases caused by Streptococcus pyogenes with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, intravenous immunoglobulin may be of benefit.
TI  - Susceptibility of a variety of clinical isolates to linezolid: a European inter-country comparison.
AB  - Using standardized in vitro susceptibility tests, 3382 bacteria recently isolated from skin, blood or respiratory tract infections were analysed for their susceptibility to linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, and a number of comparator antibacterial agents. Isolates originated in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and the UK. Laboratories in each country independently conducted broth microdilution susceptibility tests using NCCLS methods and epsilonometry (Etest). Isolates of Gram-positive cocci tested in each laboratory included methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Isolates of Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were also included. Where appropriate, comparator drugs (oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, penicillin G, clindamycin and ampicillin) were also tested. Linezolid demonstrated excellent activity against all of the Gram-positive cocci with MIC50s ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/L. The drug demonstrated only modest activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae with MIC50s ranging from 4 to 16 mg/L.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus by multivariate analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data from plate cultures.
AB  - A new fingerprinting technique with the potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) with multivariate statistical analysis. This resulted in an objective identification strategy for common clinical isolates belonging to the bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and the Streptococcus milleri group. Duplicate cultures of 104 different isolates were examined one or more times using (1)H MRS. A total of 312 cultures were examined. An optimized classifier was developed using a bootstrapping process and a seven-group linear discriminant analysis to provide objective classification of the spectra. Identification of isolates was based on consistent high-probability classification of spectra from duplicate cultures and achieved 92% agreement with conventional methods of identification. Fewer than 1% of isolates were identified incorrectly. Identification of the remaining 7% of isolates was defined as indeterminate.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - [Epidemiological survey for hemolytic streptococci isolated from children in Tokyo].
AB  - During the 20-year period between 1979-1998, a total of 4,176 strains of hemolytic streptococci have been isolated from 20,118 healthy primary school children and little children in Tokyo Metropolitan (Tokubetsuku, Tama and Tosho). Culture of throat swabs every November and the following February during the 20-year period were made and serological grouping and typing for isolates were done by T agglutination method. The results were as follows. 1) Serological group of hemolytic streptococci isolated from children were 3,188 strains (76.3%) for isolates of group A out of total strains of 4,176, 569 strains (13.6%) for isolates group B, 63 strains (1.5%) for isolates of group C and 356 strains (8.5%) for isolates of group G. 2) The most dominant was T12 during 1979-1998, and other relatively frequent serotypes were T28, T1, T4, T6 in that order. These ranks of and the main epidemic serotypes showed a similar trend in the 3 areas. 3) The isolation rates of group A streptococci were 15.9% in Tokubetsuku, 17.1% in Tama and 14.9% in Tosho. The average of 3 areas were 15.8%. 4) The epidemic cases seemed to be caused by group A streptococci were 20 cases, their isolated serotype were 7 cases by T28, 5 cases by T12, 4 cases by T6, 2 cases by T4, each 1 case by T1 and T25. 5) A total of 2,927 strains of group A streptococci were examined for drug sensitivity. All strains were sensitive to beta-lactam group of antibiotics (benzylpenicillin and cephaloridine). Resistant (MIC > or = 25 micrograms/ml) to TC, CP and EM etc. were 740 strains (25.3%) in this study. The incidence of resistant strains were to TC 493 strains (66.6%) out of 740 strains, 81 strains (10.9%) for TC.CP, 72 strains (9.7%) for EM and 66 strains (8.9%) for TC.CP.EM.OL.LCM. TC resistant strains have not varied much through the whole period, but CP and EM resistant strains were very variable by year. Many resistant strains to TC were T4, to EM and multiple drug resistant were T12. 6) The rates of isolates of the same type of group A streptococci in school child individual during for the tests taken twice a year were 12.3%, indicating group A streptococci, according to the duration of the carrier state, seems to be a short period.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials against 566 clinical isolates and comparison between NCCLS microdilution and Etest methods.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid and 11 other antimicrobials was determined for 566 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, some of them resistant to several antibiotics, using a broth microdilution method and the Etest method. All Gram-positive organisms tested were inhibited by a concentration of <or=4 mg/L of linezolid, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-intermediate and -resistant pneumococci. MICs of linezolid by the Etest method were usually one to two dilution values lower than those obtained by microdilution.
TI  - Nationwide German multicenter study on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in streptococcal blood isolates from neutropenic patients and comparative in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobials.
AB  - In a prospective multicenter study (1996 to 1999), 156 episodes of bacteremic streptococcal infections of neutropenic patients were evaluated. Streptococcus oralis (26.3%), S. pneumoniae (26.3%), S. agalactiae (11.5%), S. mitis (9%), and S. pyogenes (5.8%) were the predominant species. Four strains (2.6%) were found to be intermediately resistant to penicillin. One strain (0.6%) was found to be highly resistant to penicillin (MIC, 8 mg/liter). Reduced susceptibility to penicillin was detected among S. oralis (14.6%), S. mitis (7.1%), and S. pneumoniae (4.9%) isolates but was not recorded among S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes. Resistance rates and intermediate resistance rates for other antimicrobials were as follows (all species): amoxicillin, 1.3 and 3.2%; erythromycin, 16 and 2.6%; clindamycin, 5.8 and 0%; ciprofloxacin, 1.9 and 7.7%. Quinupristin-dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against most streptococcal isolates (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited [MIC(50)], 0.5 mg/liter; MIC(90), 1 mg/liter, MIC range, 0.25 to 4 mg/liter).
TI  - [A comparative study of antibacterial activity of ceftibuten, ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin against clinical isolates].
AB  - Ceftibuten is an orally active third generation new cephalosporin. Its antibacterial activity in vitro was tested to many clinical isolates and was compared to the activity of ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin, by twofold serial dilution method in Muller-Hinton agar--detection of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and by the disc-diffusion method of Kirby-Bauer. The new cephalosporin demonstrated great activity against the different clinical important strains. Many resistant strains to ampicillin were high susceptible to ceftibuten. The majority of Gram-negative organisms, including Enterobacteriaceae, the respiratory pathogens M.(B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae are highly susceptible to Ceftibuten, however Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter are resistant. The majority of methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus are resistant too. New cephallosporin was also active against S. pyogenes (Streptococcus gr. A) and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci, but was inactive against S. agalactiae (Streptococcus gr. B), S. pneumoniae penicillin-resistant strains and enterococci, similar to the other cephalosporins. The activity of ceftibuten was higher than that of ampicillin and cefuroxime against beta-lactamases positive strains of H. influenzae and M.(B) catarrhalis, also against tested strains of Enterobacteriaceae. The major priority of the new antibacterial agent over other cephalosporins and ampicillin is its stability to hydrolysis by the main broad-spectrum beta-lactamases producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae sp.
TI  - Bacteremia due to beta haemolytic streptococci.
AB  - The Beta haemloytic streptococci (BHS) are well recognised human pathogens causing a variety of infections, including septicemia. It is important to ensure their isolation from clinical specimens by using optimum media. Moreover, since the different groups have different pathogenic potential, it is equally important to routinely serogroup them; this is emphasized here. Since, BHS are uniformly will greatly decrease morbidity and mortality due to BHS infection.
TI  - Streptococcal IgA-binding proteins bind in the Calpha 2-Calpha 3 interdomain region and inhibit binding of IgA to human CD89.
AB  - Certain pathogenic bacteria express surface proteins that bind to the Fc part of  human IgA or IgG. These bacterial proteins are important as immunochemical tools and model systems, but their biological function is still unclear. Here, we describe studies of three streptococcal proteins that bind IgA: the Sir22 and Arp4 proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes and the unrelated beta protein of group B streptococcus. Analysis of IgA domain swap and point mutants indicated that two loops at the Calpha2/Calpha3 domain interface are critical for binding of the streptococcal proteins. This region is also used in binding the human IgA receptor CD89, an important mediator of IgA effector function. In agreement with this finding, the three IgA-binding proteins and a 50-residue IgA-binding peptide derived from Sir22 blocked the ability of IgA to bind CD89. Further, the Arp4 protein inhibited the ability of IgA to trigger a neutrophil respiratory burst via CD89. Thus, we have identified residues on IgA-Fc that play a key role in binding of different streptococcal IgA-binding proteins, and we have identified a mechanism by which a bacterial IgA-binding protein may interfere with IgA effector function.
TI  - [Carriers of beta hemolytic streptococci from groups A, B, and C among schoolchildren in Las Palmas].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Betahemolytic streptococci, particularly group A, are the most frequently isolated pathogen in the cases of acute pharyngotonsilitis in school-aged children. A study was carry out in school children of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria with the aim of knowing of the state of pharyngeral carriers of betahemolytic streptococci in Lancefield groups A, B and C. METHODS: A total of 1,002 healthy school children (520 boys and 482 girls) with ages ranging from 4 to 15 of aged were included in the study in which a pharyngeal exudate was obtained to detect the presence of betahemolytic streptococci. RESULTS: 69.5% of the healthy school children were not pharyngeal carriers of betahemolytic streptococci. The prevalence of streptococci group A in all the age groups studied was of 6%. The prevalence of beta streptococci groups B and C were of 11 and 13.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are in agreement with the literature reviewed in which the rate of pharyngeal carriers of beta-hemolytic streptococci in school children of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria are more similar that studies reported from tropical and subtropical zones showed a high prevalence of groups B and C and a lower prevalence of a group A than others communities of our country and zones with temperature climate where showed a high prevalence of group A and lower prevalence of groups B and C.
TI  - Fewer symptoms occur in same-serotype recurrent streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with acute rheumatic fever report no antecedent pharyngitis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and microbiological characteristics of recurrent group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) tonsillopharyngitis. DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial. SUBJECTS: Symptoms were recorded and throat cultures were obtained at 4 to 6, 18 to 21, and 32 to 35 days following the start of treatment. A subset of 60 patients with subsequent GABHS episodes occurring were evaluated for a 0.2-or greater log rise in either antistreptolysin O or anti-deoxyribonuclease B titer to confirm a bona fide recurrence. RESULTS: Sixteen (27%) of 60 patients had recurrent GABHS tonsillopharyngitis of the same serotype that occurred 21 days or longer following the onset of the initial GABHS infection and was associated with a 0.2- or greater log rise in either antistreptolysin O or anti-deoxyribonuclease B titer, indicating bona fide recurrent infection; these recurrences all occurred within 55 days. Fewer patients with recurrent GABHS pharyngitis of the same serotype had headache (P =.02), sore throat (P =.006), fever (P =. 008), pharyngeal erythema (P<.001), pharyngeal edema (P<.001), pharyngeal exudate (P =.04), and adenitis (P =.03) compared with the initial episode. Chills, stomachache, scarlatina, tonsillar enlargement, and palatal petechiae were similar for both episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer symptoms occur during recurrent GABHS pharyngitis of the same serotype compared with the initial infection. These patients may be less likely to seek physician attention, yet their infections put them at risk for sequelae.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Identification of streptococci isolated from various sources by determination of  cfb gene and other CAMP-factor genes.
AB  - In the present study, the CAMP-factor (cfb) gene of streptococci of serological group B (Streptococcus agalactiae) and the CAMP-factor (cfu) gene of S. uberis could be amplified by polymerase chain reaction. A cfb specific amplicon could be observed for all 128 phenotypically CAMP-positive S. agalactiae, for the phenotypically CAMP-negative S. agalactiae strain 74-360, and for 2 S. difficile reference strains. A cfu specific amplicon could be observed for all 7 phenotypically CAMP-positive S. uberis. Four S. agalactiae strains isolated from 4 cows with mastitis appeared to be phenotypically CAMP-negative and negative in the cfb gene PCR. The CAMP-positive and CAMP-negative isolates, including both S. difficile, could be identified as S. agalactiae by amplification of a S. agalactiae specific part of the V2 region of the 16S rRNA and a species-specific part of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region. Amplification of an internal fragment of the cfb gene with a reduced annealing temperature yielded positive reactions not only for CAMP-positive S. agalactiae, but also for phenotypically CAMP-positive S. pyogenes (n = 4), S. canis (n = 28), and S. uberis (n = 7), indicating a close relation of the CAMP genes of these 4 species. The relation could be further demonstrated by sequencing the internal fragment of the CAMP-factor (cfg) gene of S. canis and comparing the sequence with those of S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, and S. uberis.
TI  - [National multicenter study of the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens. Spanish Study Group on Moxifloxacin].
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine Spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent in vitro activity against most tested isolates with MIC90 values of 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for Haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. viridans, by the betalactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. Moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active than moxifloxacin when tested against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates. The microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Cross-protection between group A and group B streptococci due to cross-reacting surface proteins.
AB  - The R28 protein of group A streptococcus (GAS) and the Rib protein of group B streptococcus (GBS) are surface molecules that elicit protective immunity to experimental infection. These proteins are members of the same family and cross-react immunologically. In spite of extensive amino acid residue identity, the cross-reactivity between R28 and Rib was found to be limited, as shown by analysis with highly purified proteins and specific antisera. Nevertheless, immunization of mice with purified R28 conferred protection against lethal infection with Rib-expressing GBS strains, and immunization with Rib conferred protection against R28-expressing GAS. Thus, R28 and Rib elicited cross-protective immunity. Characterization of many clinical GAS and GBS isolates expressing R28 or Rib, respectively, indicated that most of them expressed proteins similar to those of the reference strains. Analysis of these data suggests that cross-protection may influence the outcome of natural infections with R28-expressing GAS and Rib-expressing GBS.
TI  - [Sensitivity of groups A, B and C beta hemolytic streptococci to antibiotics].
AB  - We studied the susceptibility of 330 strains of beta hemolytic streptococci (60 group A, 125 group B, 145 group C) isolated from healthy school children in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria to 17 antibiotics. Only 2% of group A streptococci showed resistance to erythromycin, and 18% to 31% of the beta hemolytic streptococci strains were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. All of these strains showed susceptibility to betalactam antibiotics, chloramphenicol, clindamycin and vancomycin. Most of them were resistant to tetracycline and aminoglycoside antibiotics.
TI  - [National Multicenter study of the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against respiratory tract pathogens]
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a novel 8-methoxyquinolone, was evaluated against 1,218 respiratory pathogens isolated in nine Spanish hospitals and was compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, erythromycin and clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin exhibited an excellent in vitro activity against most tested isolates with MIC90 values of 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci; 0.12 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes; 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.06 and 4 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, respectively; 0.06 mg/l for Haemophilus influenzae and 0.12 mg/l for Moraxella catarrhalis. Moxifloxacin susceptibility rates were not affected by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae and S. viridans, by the betalactamase production in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis or by macrolide resistance. Moxifloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin and four to sixteen times more active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive isolates. Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were slightly more active than moxifloxacin when tested against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates. The microbiological data obtained confirm that moxifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant streptococci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the new agents linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin were determined and compared with those of penicillin, clindamycin, and four macrolides against 53 erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 117 S. pyogenes (64 erythromycin-susceptible and 53 -resistant), and 101 S. agalactiae (53 erythromycin-susceptible and 48 -resistant) isolates. Differentiation of macrolide resistance phenotypes was performed by the double-disk method. The genetic basis for macrolide resistance in 52 strains was also determined. The M phenotype was found in 84.9, 6.3, and 1.9% of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. These strains were susceptible to miocamycin and clindamycin. Strains with the inducible phenotype accounted for 27.1% of S. agalactiae isolates and 9.4% each of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae isolates. All erythromycin-resistant isolates were also resistant to the 14- and 15-membered macrolides tested. Strains with all three phenotypes were susceptible to </=2 microgram of linezolid per ml. Quinupristin-dalfopristin exhibited good in vitro activity against all strains, irrespective of their resistance to erythromycin (MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited [MIC(90)s], 0.2 to 1 microgram/ml). Against the erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae strains, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were the most active agents (MIC(90)s, 0.1 microgram/ml). The new antimicrobials evaluated may be alternative agents to treat infections caused by macrolide-resistant as well as macrolide-susceptible streptococci.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Semmelweis: the combat against puerperal fever.
AB  - Groups A and B streptococci are of great significance in the history of obstetrics. Group A streptococci were a great threat to the puerperium, especially in the 19th century, when homebirth was replaced by institutional birth in lying-in hospitals. The history of the rise and fall of puerperal fever is indeed a tragedy. Some people, like Semmelweis, who brought new and important evidence based findings were not believed by their fellow obstetricians, an attitude that spoiled thousands of innocent lives. Even today group A streptococci, though seldom, may be the cause of puerperal sepsis. Group B streptococci are widespread and may cause sepsis and important lifelong morbidity or mortality of the newborn. Obstetricians today try to establish cost-effective prophylactic measures during labor to prevent these neonatal infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared with other antimicrobial agents against recent clinical isolates of streptococci.
AB  - This study investigated the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) against 50 recent clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and viridans streptococci using the microdilution method. This activity was compared with that of the quinolone agents ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trovafloxacin and grepafloxacin, and with that of penicillin, ampicillin, clarithromycin and azithromycin. Gemifloxacin was significantly more potent than the other quinolones tested. Its potency was equal to that of penicillin for S. agalactiae, and superior to that of penicillin for viridans streptococci. The MIC(50) of gemifloxacin for S. pyogenes (0.015 mg/L) was equal to that of penicillin, with an MIC(90) of 0.03 mg/L. Gemifloxacin was also active against isolates of S. agalactiae (MIC = 0.03-0.06 mg/L) and S. pyogenes (MIC = 0.03- 0.06 mg/L) with reduced susceptibility to ofloxacin (MIC = 4-8 mg/L) and grepafloxacin (MIC = 4 mg/L). These preliminary observations indicate that gemifloxacin is a promising antimicrobial agent for clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Beta 2 integrins are involved in cytokine responses to whole Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines have an important pathophysiologic role in septic shock. CD14 is involved in cytokine responses to a number of purified bacterial products, including LPS. However, little is known of monocyte receptors involved in cytokine responses to whole bacteria. To identify these receptors, human monocytes were pretreated with different mAbs and TNF-alpha was measured in culture supernatants after stimulation with whole heat-killed bacteria. Human serum and anti-CD14 Abs significantly increased and decreased, respectively, TNF-alpha responses to the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. However, neither treatment influenced responses to any of the Gram-positive bacteria tested, including group A and B streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Complement receptor type III (CR3 or CD18/CD11b) Abs prevented TNF-alpha release induced by heat-killed group A or B streptococci. In contrast, the same Abs had no effects when monocytes were stimulated with L. monocytogenes or S. aureus. Using either of the latter bacteria, significant inhibition of TNF-alpha release was produced by Abs to CD11c, one of the subunits of CR4. To confirm these blocking Ab data, IL-6 release was measured in CR3-, CR4-, or CD14-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells after bacterial stimulation. Accordingly, streptococci triggered moderate IL-6 production (p < 0.05) in CR3 but not CD14 or CR4 transfectants. In contrast, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus induced IL-6 release in CR4 but not CR3 or CD14 transfectants. Collectively our data indicate that beta 2 integrins, such as CR3 and CR4, may be involved in cytokine responses to Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, CD14 may play a more important role in responses to whole Gram-negative bacteria relative to Gram-positive ones.
TI  - Characterization of the streptococcal C5a peptidase using a C5a-green fluorescent protein fusion protein substrate.
AB  - A glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-C5a-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was designed for use as a substrate for the streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCPA). The substrate was immobilized on a glutathione-Sepharose affinity matrix and used to measure wild-type SCPA activity in the range of 0.8 to 800 nM. The results of the assay demonstrated that SCPA is highly heat stable and has optimal activity on the synthetic substrate at or above pH 8.0. SCPA activity was unaffected by 0.1 to 10 mM Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and Mn(2+) but was inhibited by the same concentrations of Zn(2+). The assay shows high sensitivity to ionic strength; NaCl inhibits SCPA cleavage of GST-C5a-GFP in a dose-dependent manner. Based on previously published computer homology modeling, four substitutions were introduced into the putative active site of SCPA: Asp(130)-Ala, His(193)-Ala, Asn(295)-Ala, and Ser(512)-Ala. All four mutant proteins had over 1,000-fold less proteolytic activity on C5a in vitro, as determined both by the GFP assay described here and by a polymorphonuclear cell adherence assay. In addition, recombinant SCPA1 and SCPA49, from two distinct lineages of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci), and recombinant SCPB, from Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci), were compared in the GFP assay. The three enzymes had similar activities, all cleaving approximately 6 mol of C5a mmol of SCP(-1) liter(-1) min(-1).
TI  - High frequency invasion of mammalian cells by beta hemolytic streptococci.
AB  
TI  - Group B streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. To identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from A549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. These plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled GBS as a probe. GBS adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kDa (p50) and 57 kDa (p57). We concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of CK8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with CK8 after separation by two-dimensional PAGE; (iii) CK8 in solution bound to GBS, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from A549 lysates that bound to GBS in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled GBS bound to A549 lysate-derived CK8 that had been captured in anti-CK8-coated microtiter wells. CK8 bound to COH1-13, an acapsular mutant of COH1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. Trypsin-treated GBS did not bind to CK8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of GBS. Soluble CK8 bound to six of six GBS strains tested. Soluble CK8 also bound to Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. We hypothesize that adherence of GBS to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced Gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against Gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some Gram-positive organisms. We compared the in vitro activity of these compounds against 4151 Gram-negative and -positive organisms. Gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. All compounds were highly active (overall) against Gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data indicate that the advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - The extracellular hyaluronidase gene (hylA) of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Group A streptococci produce an extracellular hyaluronidase (hyaluronate lyase) which may be associated with the spread of the organism during infection. The gene for this hyaluronidase (hylA) encodes an 868 amino acid protein with a molecular size of 99636 Da. Cleavage of the proposed signal peptide results in an extracellular protein of 95941 Da. Comparison with other bacterial hyaluronidases indicates strong similarities to the genes from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. A region internal to the hylA gene was amplified from all 175 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes tested suggesting a widespread distribution of the gene.
TI  - Characteristics of Streptococcus species isolated from infectious skin diseases.
AB  - During the period from January of 1995 to June of 1998, 27 beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 25 cases of infectious skin diseases including secondary infections, impetigo, phlegmone, and paronychia. The rate of beta-hemolytic streptococci among all kinds of the isolates was found to be similar during those 4 years, ranging from 3.5% to 5.6%. Staphylococcus aureus were found to coexist with beta-hemolytic streptococci in 20 (80%) out of 25 cases. beta-hemolytic streptococci were also often associated with coagulase-negative staphylococci, gram-positive rods, or other species. Twelve cases (48%) carried beta-hemolytic streptococci predominantly. Most beta-hemolytic streptococci showed high susceptibilities to all antimicrobials tested; however S. agalactiae showed no susceptibility to gentamicin. The evaluation of characteristics of Streptococcus species is very important for selecting the right antimicrobial agents and the proper term of chemotherapy.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Listeria). Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. Uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to penicillin (S. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, and in Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Moreover, 1 of 22 S. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 E. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. Resistances to levofloxacin with MIC90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and E. faecalis isolates. In any case, the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. In time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an E. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Group B streptococcal surface proteins as targets for protective antibodies: identification of two novel proteins in strains of serotype V.
AB  - Strains of group B streptococcus (GBS) express surface proteins that confer protective immunity. In particular, most strains of the four classical capsular serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, and III) express either of the Rib and alpha proteins, two members of the same protein family. Here, we report a study of surface proteins expressed by strains of serotype V, which has recently emerged as an important serotype among GBS strains causing serious disease. Two novel GBS proteins were identified, purified, and characterized. One of these proteins, designated Fbs, was immunologically unrelated to other GBS surface proteins. This approximately 110-kDa protein was found in 15 of 49 (31%) type V isolates but in few strains of other serotypes. The Fbs proteins expressed by different strains showed limited variation in size. The most common surface protein among type V strains, found in 29 of 49 (59%) isolates, was designated Rib-like, since it cross-reacted with Rib but was not immunologically identical to Rib. Characterization of this Rib-like protein showed that the N-terminal sequence (12 residues) was identical to that of alpha, although these two proteins lacked cross-reactivity. The biochemical and immunological properties of the Rib-like GBS protein indicate that it is closely related to the R28 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes. Importantly, passive and active immunization experiments with mice showed that the Fbs and Rib-like proteins are targets for protective antibodies. These two proteins are therefore of interest for analysis of pathogenic mechanisms and for vaccine development.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide Gram-positive spectrum.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against Gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. We compared the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The susceptibility of 37 Staphylococcus aureus (14 MS, 23 MR), 26 Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 MS, 10 MR), 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, 15 Streptococcus agalactiae, 10 Enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 Enterococcus faecium (9 van A) was evaluated. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all Gram-positive species tested, including met-R S. aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), met-R S. epidermidis (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), S. pneumoniae (MIC < or = 1 mg/l), ery-R and ery-S streptococci (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). The strains of E. faecalis were generally less susceptible. Time-kill studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x MIC concentration showed a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x MIC concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. A prolonged PAE was obtained for S. pneumoniae (8 h), S. pyogenes (9 h) and S. agalactiae (7 h), while the shortest PAE was seen for E. faecalis and E. faecium (about 4 h).
TI  - Multi-domain, cell-envelope proteinases of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The multi-domain, cell-envelope proteinases encoded by the genes prtB of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, prtH of Lactobacillus helveticus, prtP of Lactococcus lactis, scpA of Streptococcus pyogenes and csp of Streptococcus agalactiae have been compared using multiple sequence alignment, secondary structure prediction and database homology searching methods. This comparative analysis has led to the prediction of a number of different domains in these cell-envelope proteinases, and their homology, characteristics and putative function are described. These domains include, starting from the N-terminus, a pre-pro-domain for secretion and activation, a serine protease domain (with a smaller inserted domain), two large middle domains A and B of unknown but possibly regulatory function, a helical spacer domain, a hydrophilic cell-wall spacer or attachment domain, and a cell-wall anchor domain. Not all domains are present in each cell-envelope proteinase, suggesting that these multi-domain proteins are the result of gene shuffling and domain swapping during evolution.
TI  - Etiology of pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis in infants younger than three months of age in Ethiopia.
AB  - METHODS: Within a multicenter study coordinated by WHO, an investigation of the etiologic agents of pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis was performed among infants younger than 3 months of age seen at the Ethio-Swedish Children's Hospital in Addis Ababa for a period of 2 years. Of the 816 infants enrolled 405 had clinical indications for investigation. RESULTS: There were a total of 41 isolates from blood cultures from 40 infants. The study showed that the traditionally known acute respiratory infection pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae was most common in this extended neonatal age group, found in 10 of 41 blood isolates. Streptococcus pyogenes was a common pathogen in this setting (9 of 41 blood isolates), whereas Salmonella group B was found in 5 of 41 isolates. Streptococcus agalactiae, which is a common pathogen in developed countries, was absent. A study of the susceptibility pattern of these organisms suggests that a combination of ampicillin with an aminoglycoside is adequate for initial treatment of these serious bacterial infections, but the combination is not optimal for the treatment of Salmonella infections. Among 202 infants on whom immunofluorescent antibody studies for viruses were performed based on nasopharyngeal aspirates, respiratory syncytial virus was found in 57 (28%) infants, and Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 32 (15.8%) of 203 infants.
TI  - Etiology of serious infections in young Gambian infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including The Gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. The study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in Gambian infants younger than 91 days old. METHODS: At a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid. At a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. RESULTS: There were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1), Streptococcus agalactiae (1) and Salmonella spp. (1). Six of these children died. Thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus (17), S. pneumoniae (3), Salmonella spp. (5), E. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and S. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were investigated for common respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza A in 46, influenza B in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. Of these 184 (58%) were positive for S. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for H. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. Infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die, whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The most important causes of serious infections in young Gambian infants are Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae and Salmonella spp.
TI  - Characteristics in adherence of streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus isolated from various infective skin lesions: serum IgA decreases adherence of Streptococcus pyogenes but not Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We characterized adherence of streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from various infective skin lesions in terms of hydrophobicity, negative charge, tube adherence, slime production, and influence on adherence to coverslips by plasma and serum immunoglobulins. High hydrophobicity was more frequently observed in Streptococcus pyogenes strains than in Streptococcus agalactiae strains (P < 0.01) and S. aureus strains (P < 0.001) and slime production was more frequently observed in S. agalactiae strains than in S. pyogenes strains (P < 0.05). Serum IgA decreased adherence to coverslips of S. pyogenes strains but not that of S. aureus strains.
TI  - V2 regions of 16S ribosomal RNA used as a molecular marker for the species identification of streptococci in peripheral blood and synovial fluid from patients with psoriatic arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of 3 streptococcal species in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection targets bacterial 16S rRNA, which is present in bacteria at high copy numbers. The 3 species-specific primers for group A streptococci (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes), group B streptococci (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae), and Streptococcus pneumoniae were designed from the fragments of highly variable V2 regions of 16S rRNA. Total RNA was prepared from whole peripheral blood and joint fluid obtained from patients with PsA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All positive PCR reactions were then sequenced with a Pharmacia ALF DNA sequencing system. RESULTS: Our data in 19 PsA patients showed that 7 peripheral blood samples were positive for GAS (P = 0.006 versus GAS-positive RA patients [n = 0], by Fisher's exact test), and 2 were also positive for GBS. One synovial fluid sample from a PsA patient was positive for GAS. S pneumoniae was absent from all specimens. Seventeen patients with RA were PCR negative for the 3 streptococcal species. Peripheral blood from a patient with inflammatory bowel disease was positive for GAS. CONCLUSION: The presence of GAS 16S rRNA in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with PsA supports the concept that PsA is a reactive arthritis to certain streptococci.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Characterization of Enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase and use in identifying Streptococcus agalactiae secreted proteins.
AB  - We have identified and characterized an Enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase (AP, encoded by phoZ). The predicted gene product shows homology with alkaline phosphatases from a variety of species; it has especially high similarity with two alkaline phosphatases from Bacillus subtilis. Expression of phoZ in Escherichia coli, E. faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), or Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) produces a blue-colony phenotype on plates containing a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (XP or BCIP). Two tests were made to determine if the activity of the enzyme is dependent upon the enzyme's subcellular location. First, elimination of the signal sequence reduced AP activity to 3% of the wild-type activity (or less) in three species of gram-positive bacteria. Restoration of export, using the signal sequence from C5a peptidase, restored AP activity to at least 50% of that of the wild type. Second, we engineered two chimeric proteins in which AP was fused to either a periplasmic domain or a cytoplasmic domain of lactose permease (a membrane protein). In E. coli, the periplasmic fusion had 17-fold-higher AP activity than the cytoplasmic fusion. We concluded that AP activity is export dependent. The signal sequence deletion mutant, phoZDeltass, was used to identify random genomic fragments from GBS that encode exported proteins or integral membrane proteins. Included in this set of fragments were genes that exhibited homology with the Rib protein (a cell wall protein from GBS) or with DppB (an integral membrane protein from GAS). AP acts as a reporter enzyme in GBS, GAS, and E. faecalis and is expected to be useful in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Identification, cloning, and expression of the CAMP factor gene (cfa) of group A  streptococci.
AB  - The CAMP reaction is a synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by the interaction of an extracellular protein (CAMP factor) produced by some streptococcal species with the Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase C (beta-toxin). Group A streptococci (GAS [Streptococcus pyogenes]) have been long considered CAMP negative, and this reaction commonly has been used to distinguish GAS from Streptococcus agalactiae. We here provide evidence that GAS possess this gene and produce an extracellular CAMP factor capable of participating in a positive CAMP reaction. The S. pyogenes CAMP factor is specified by a 774-bp open reading frame homologous to the CAMP factor genes from S. agalactiae and Streptococcus uberis. This gene, designated cfa, was isolated on a 1,256-bp fragment and cloned in Escherichia coli. Recombinant clones of E. coli expressing cfa secreted an active CAMP factor. The deduced 28.5-kDa protein encoded by cfa consists of 257 amino acids, with a predicted 28-amino-acid signal peptide. The cfa gene is widely spread among GAS: 82 of 100 clinical GAS isolates produced a positive CAMP reaction. Of the CAMP-negative strains, 17 of the 18 GAS strains contained the cfa gene. Additionally, CAMP activity was detected in streptococci from serogroups C, M, P, R, and U. The cfa gene was cloned and actively expressed in Escherichia coli and gene fusions were made, placing the beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) under control of the cfa promoter. These cfa promoter-lacZ fusions were introduced into S. pyogenes via a bacteriophage-derived site-specific integration vector where they showed that the cfa gene has a strong promoter that may be subject to as-yet-unidentified regulatory factors. The results presented here, along with previous reports, indicate that the CAMP factor gene is fairly widespread among streptococci, being present at least in groups A, B, C, G, M, P, R, and U.
TI  - Streptococcal meningitis in adult patients: current epidemiology and clinical spectrum.
AB  - Streptococci other than Streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. We report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). The patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. Nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. Causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; Streptococcus agalactiae, 3; Streptococcus bovis, 2; and Streptococcus pyogenes, 1. Four Streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (MIC, 0.5-2 microg/mL). Five patients (17%) died. The infection is increasing in the hospital setting. Streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. In cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the Streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - [The implications of non-group-A streptococci in human pathology].
AB  
TI  - The R28 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes is related to several group B streptococcal surface proteins, confers protective immunity and promotes binding to human epithelial cells.
AB  - The R28 protein is a surface molecule expressed by some strains of Streptococcus  pyogenes (group A streptococcus). Here, we present evidence that R28 may play an important role in virulence. Sequence analysis demonstrated that R28 has an extremely repetitive sequence and can be viewed as a chimera derived from the three surface proteins Rib, alpha and beta of the group B streptococcus (GBS). Thus, the gene encoding R28 may have originated in GBS. The R28 protein promotes adhesion to human epithelial cells, as shown by experiments with an R28-negative mutant and by the demonstration that antibodies to highly purified R28 inhibited adhesion. In a mouse model of lethal intraperitoneal S. pyogenes infection, antibodies to R28 conferred protective immunity. However, the virulence of an R28-negative mutant was similar to that of the parental strain in the intraperitoneal infection model. Together, these data indicate that R28 represents a novel type of adhesin expressed by S. pyogenes and that R28 may also act as a target for protective antibodies at later stages of an infection. We consider the hypothesis that R28 played a pathogenetic role in the well-known epidemics of childbed fever (puerperal fever), which were caused by S. pyogenes. A role for R28 in these epidemics is suggested by epidemiological data.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of G1: a novel antimicrobial compound.
AB  - G1 (1-[5-bromofur-2-il]-2-bromo-2-nitroethene) is a novel antimicrobial compound  developed in Cuba with reported broadspectrum activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. A compound of this nature may have considerable therapeutic potential. We tested the in vitro activity of this novel compound against 3595 organisms using microbroth dilution. The following are MIC50, MIC90 and range respectively for some of the microorganisms tested: E. coli 16, 16, 4 32; Klebsiella sp. 16, 16, 8 32; Citrobacter sp. 16, 16, 8 16; Enterobacter sp. 16, 16, 8-16; Proteus sp. 16, 16, 8-16; Coagulase-negative staphylococci 16, 32, 4-32; Enterococcus sp. 16, 32, 2-32; Staphylococcus aureus 8, 16, 4-16; Streptococcus agalactiae 4, 8, 4 8; Streptococcus pyogenes 4, 8, 0.25-16; Candida albicans 2, 2, 1-4; Candida tropicalis 4, 4, 2-4; Candida sp. 2,4, 1-4. MIC values appear lower for Gram-positive microorganisms and yeasts. G1 appears to be a novel antimicrobial agent with broad spectrum activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Defining the activity of this compound against multi-resistant bacteria is a priority.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (OFLX) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST), while Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefaclor (CCL). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-positive and -negative cocci. However, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, cefmetazole (CMZ), vancomycin (VCM), latamoxef (LMOX), ST and minocycline (MINO) showed good activities against some of the Gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. In conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.
TI  - [Genetic analysis of pathogenic streptococci groups A and B].
AB  - The study deals with the genetic mapping of chromosomal DNA of groups A (AS) and  B (BS) pathogenetic Streptococci. Its stages are presented and considered. The maps of these microorganisms are compared. A collection of epidemic AS and BS was analyzed by employing pulsed field gel electrophoresis. AS and BS were found to show heterogeneity of DNA sequences and the common pattern of gene location on the chromosomes.
TI  - [Study on bacteremia due to community-acquired infection in infants and children  without underlying diseases].
AB  - Between July 1988 and June 1998, 22 pediatric patients without underlying diseases were diagnosed as bacteremia caused by community-acquired infection in Asahikawa Kosei Hospital. The age range of the patients was from 7 days to 4 years. Their diseases were meningitis in 6, urinary tract infection in 6, respiratory tract infection in 4, skin infection in 2, and unknown origin in 4. The causative organisms were Escherichia coli in 7, Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Streptococcus pyogenes in 1, Streptococcus agalactiae in 1, Listeria monocytogenes in 1, Moraxella catarrhalis in 1, and Rahnella aquatilis in 1. Though 21 patients recovered with antimicrobial treatment, only one patient with H. influenzae meningitis had lateral deafness and paresis in the lower limbs as sequelae.
TI  - Blue/white screening of recombinant plasmids in Gram-positive bacteria by interruption of alkaline phosphatase gene (phoZ) expression.
AB  - The process of screening bacterial transformants for recombinant plasmids is made more rapid and simple by the use of vectors with visually detectable reporter genes. In such systems, an alteration in colony phenotype occurs when a vector-borne indicator gene is interrupted with exogenous DNA. Although the lacZ system has been used extensively for this purpose in E. coli, analogous systems for use in Gram-positive bacteria remain uncommon. We have developed a Gram-positive cloning vector that utilizes the interruption of an alkaline phosphatase gene, phoZ, to identify recombinant plasmids. To facilitate introduction of foreign DNA, a multiple cloning site (MCS) was inserted distal to the region coding for the putative signal peptide of phoZ. Alkaline phosphatase expressed from the derivative phoZ gene (phoZMCS) retained activity similar to that of the native protein. The phoZMCS was transferred to pJS3, a well-characterized, high-copy number, and broad-host-range plasmid, to produce pDC123. In pDC123, phoZMCS was transcriptionally linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene under the control of the constitutively expressed tetM and cat promoters that drive cat expression in pJS3. S. agalactiae (Group B streptococci, GBS), E. faecalis, S. pyogenes, S. gordonii, and E. coli containing pDC123 displayed a blue colonial phenotype on agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (X-p), which was readily distinguished from that of colonies containing the parent plasmid pJS3. Introduction of foreign DNA into the MCS of phoZMCS produced a white colonial phenotype in E. coli and GBS on agar containing X-p and allowed discrimination between transformants containing recombinant plasmids versus those maintaining self-annealed or uncut vector. We have used pDC123 to subclone the cpsE gene from the plasmid pCER111, which carries a 9.0-kb fragment of the GBS capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus. The plasmid pDC123 containing cpsE was isolated by direct electroporation into GBS strain A909 with selection of transformants containing recombinant plasmids achieved by 'blue/white' screening, without the use of an intermediate host. This new cloning vector should improve the efficiency of performing recombinant DNA experiments in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on tazobactam/piperacillin in pediatric field].
AB  - A drug susceptibility test of the combination drug TAZ/PIPC, which consists of a  newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam (TAZ), and one of penicillin antibiotics, piperacillin (PIPC), with combination ratio of 1:4 in potency, was conducted with stock strains and clinical isolates. The clinical efficacy and safety of its injection was also evaluated in children with a variety of infectious diseases. The results were as follows: 1. In susceptibility test, 114 strains from 4 species of stock strains were treated with 8 drugs, that is, TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, penicillin G (PCG), ampicillin (ABPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ). Of three clinically isolated species from patients, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was treated with TAZ/PIPC, PIPC, methicillin (DMPPC), CTM, CTX, and SBT/CPZ, and the others were treated with the same drugs except for DMPPC. The MICs were measured for these bacterial strains inoculated at the concentration of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC90 values of TAZ/PIPC against 45 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), one of the stock cultures of Gram-positive cocci, were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC for 28 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) were 0.39 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTM, CAZ, and SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 10 strains of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) were 0.10 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC. The MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 31 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of PIPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Regarding Gram-positive cocci isolated from patients received this combination drug, the MIC90 of TAZ/PIPC against 2 strains of S. aureus, a non beta-lactamase producing strain and a low-beta-lactamase producing strain, were 0.78 microgram/ml and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively; the former value was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTM, and CTX, and the latter was similar to those of PIPC, DMPPC, CTX, and SBT/CPZ. Of 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains were inhibited at 0.05 microgram/ml, and the others at 1.56 micrograms/ml; both values were similar to those of PIPC, SBT/CPZ. As for Gram-negative bacilli, 6 of 7 strains of H. influenzae did not produce beta-lactamase and 1 strain was a high producer. The MICs of TAZ/PIPC against beta-lactamase nonproducing strains were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml in 5 strains and 0.39 microgram/ml in 1 strain, and the values were similar to those of PIPC and SBT/CPZ. While the MIC of TAZ/PIPC against the high beta-lactamase producing strain was 0.78 microgram/ml; similar to that of SBT/CPZ and smaller than that of PIPC. 2. The results of clinical effects on 7 diseases in 33 cases were as follows: TAZ/PIPC was clinically judged "excellent" in 17 (51.5%); good in 14 (42.4%); fair in 2 (6.1%). No case with no response was seen in this study, and the total efficacy rate of "excellent" and "good" was 93.9%. 3. Bacteriological effects were evaluated in 17 strains of 4 species, and all of them were eradicated. 4. Adverse reactions were judged in 35, which consisted of 33 in which the clinical effects were evaluated and 2 dropped from this study. Of these cases, diarrhea was observed in 4 (11.4%). 5. Laboratory tests revealed an increase in platelets in 1 of 32 cases (3.1%), and eosinophilia in 2 of 29 cases (6.9%). Biochemical profile showed an increase in GPT alone and abnormal increases in both GOT and GPT in 1 each out of 21 cases.
TI  - Azithromycin. A review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  - Azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. Pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. In children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. These standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. Azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. Community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. Azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. However, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. Skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. Although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.
TI  - Use of the lactococcal nisA promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  - We characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisA promoter in strains of the gram-positive species Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis. nisA promoter activity was dependent on the proteins NisR and NisK, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the extracellular inducer nisin. The nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. Significant induction of the nisA promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is inhibited. The efficiency of the nisA promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the Spac, xylA, and lacA promoters in B. subtilis and in S. pyogenes. Because nisA promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  - This report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in Q/D worldwide Phase III comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. Q/D was highly active, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) < or = 1.0 microg/mL against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. Q/D was active (MICs < or = 1 microg/mL) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. Q/D was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus strains (MIC90=1 microg/mL), as was vancomycin (MIC90=2 microg/mL), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (MIC90=32 vs 1 microg/mL). Given its spectrum of activity, Q/D may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.
TI  - Identification of a novel insertion element, IS1548, in group B streptococci, predominantly in strains causing endocarditis.
AB  - Hyaluronidase has been postulated to be a virulence factor in group B streptococci (GBS). No hyaluronidase activity was found in 15 of 50 GBS isolates from adults studied. Most of these hyaluronidase-negative strains belonged to serotype III. In strains lacking hyaluronidase activity, an insertion of 1317 nucleotides was found in the hyaluronidase gene. The fragment was cloned and sequenced and found to have characteristics of a novel insertion sequence, designated IS1548. As well as in GBS serotype III, this sequence was found in 3 of 6 serotype II isolates and in all 10 group A streptococcal strains (GAS) tested. Homologies were found with repeated sequences in Streptococcus pneumoniae and with H repeats in Escherichia coli. All GBS strains harboring IS1548 and some GAS strains had one copy of IS1548 located downstream of the C5a peptidase gene. IS1548 was present in 9 of 13 GBS isolates from blood in endocarditis patients and in 3 of 22 vaginally colonizing strains.
TI  - Import and metabolism of glutathione by Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Glutathione (gamma-GluCysGly, GSH) is not found in most gram-positive bacteria, but some appear to synthesize it and others, including Streptococcus mutans ATCC 33402, import it from their growth medium. Import of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) by S. mutans 33402 in 7H9 medium was shown to require glucose and to occur with an apparent Km of 18+/-5 microM. GSSG, GSH, S-methylglutathione, and homocysteine-glutathione mixed disulfide (hCySSG) were imported at comparable rates (measured by depletion of substrate in the medium), as was the disulfide of gamma-GluCys. In contrast, the disulfide of CysGly was not taken up at a measurable rate, indicating that the gamma-Glu residue is important for efficient transport. During incubation with GSSG, little GSSG was detected in cells but GSH and gamma-GluCys accumulated during the first 30 min and then declined. No significant intracellular accumulation of Cys or sulfide was found. Transient intracellular accumulation of D/L-homocysteine, as well as GSH and gamma-GluCys, was observed during import of hCySSG. Although substantial levels of GSH were found in cells when S. mutans was grown on media containing glutathione, such GSH accumulation had no effect on the growth rate. However, the presence of cellular GSH did protect against growth inhibition by the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide. Import of glutathione by S. mutans ATCC 25175, which like strain 33402 does not synthesize glutathione, occurred at a rate comparable to that of strain 33402, but three species which appear to synthesize glutathione (S. agalactiae ATCC 12927, S. pyogenes ATCC 8668, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) imported glutathione at negligible or markedly lower rates.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of GV129606, a new broad-spectrum trinem.
AB  - GV129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. It combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. Comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for GV129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes, including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). Against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, GV129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. GV129606 showed an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, GV129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed MIC90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. Meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae with MIC90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. Against these species, GV129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with MIC90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of Proteus rettgeri and Providencia stuartii). Haemophilus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of GV129606. GV129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. It was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). The in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ED50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. GV129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ED50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel macrolide efflux gene, mreA, from Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - A strain of Streptococcus agalactiae displayed resistance to 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides. In PCR assays, total genomic DNA from this strain contained neither erm nor mef genes. EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from this strain was cloned into lambda Zap II to construct a library of S. agalactiae genomic DNA. A clone, pAES63, expressing resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and spiramycin in Escherichia coli was recovered. Deletion derivatives of pAES63 which defined a functional region on this clone that encoded resistance to 14- and 15-membered, but not 16-membered, macrolides were produced. Studies that determined the levels of incorporation of radiolabelled erythromycin into E. coli were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. This putative efflux determinant was distinct from the recently described Mef pump in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae and from the multicomponent MsrA pump in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Its gene has been designated mreA (for macrolide resistance efflux).
TI  - [Comparative antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  - RP 59,500 (Quinupristin-Dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. The components of RP 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). Susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci. RP 59,500 was active against a wide range of Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. RP 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus agalactiae and Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. No cross-resistance was observed between RP 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. The effect of human serum on the MIC of RP 59,500 was studied with strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The presence of 20% (V/V) serum had little or no effect on the MIC, although 50% (V/V) serum increased MICs by 4-8 folds. Laboratory-induced resistance to RP 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. Population analysis was performed on RP 59,500 and the reference macrolides against S. aureus ATCC 25,923 strain. Although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with EM, CAM, AZM and RXM, no RP 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
TI  - [Trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in Japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  - We observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in Japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified in 254 among the 266 patients. Their ages were less than 3 months after birth in 50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. The causative organisms were H. influenzae in 134 patients and S. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. Next to the above bacteria ranked S. agalactiae in 29 and E. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. Staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. L. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and N. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. S. pyogenes, Enterococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., P. Mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. The causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. H. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but S. pneumoniae exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. There was a decreasing tendency with S. agalactiae and E. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. Although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. Listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. However, panipenem (phonetic) is likely to be effective for insensible S. pneumoniae for the time being.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  - The purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (RXM). We measured the MICs of macrolide antibiotics, such as RXM, erythromycin (EM), clarithromycin (CAM), rokitamycin (RKM) and midecamycin (MDM), and other classes of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between October and December in 1994 and 1995. RXM had excellent antibacterial activities for S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and methicillin sensitive S. aureus. Against methicillin sensitive S. epidermidis, RXM activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had MIC > or = 128 micrograms/ml. The activity against S. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of EM, CAM, MDM, and clindamycin. The vast majority of methicillin resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. In conclusion, RXM is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus except MRSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis and M. pneumoniae.
TI  - Lancefield grouping and smell of caramel for presumptive identification and assessment of pathogenicity in the Streptococcus milleri group.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate Lancefield grouping and caramel smell for presumptive identification of the Streptococcus milleri group, and to find whether Lancefield group, species, or protein profile correlated with virulence or infection site. METHODS: Prospective studies were made of 100 consecutive streptococcal isolates in blood cultures or pus from 100 patients in whom the severity of infection was categorised as serious, moderate, or not significant. The usefulness of Lancefield group and the caramel smell for presumptive identification was examined, and the relation of the S milleri species, Lancefield group, and SDS-PAGE protein analysis to severity of infection and infection site was investigated. Lower respiratory tract and genital tract specimens, strict anaerobes, group D streptococci, and strains identified as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus agalactiae were excluded. RESULTS: Most streptococci occurring in pure or significant growth density were S milleri group (87/100; 87%, 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.93). Of these, 89.7% (78/87; 0.84-0.96) were associated with infection. Lancefield group F antigen predominated (41/87; 47.1%, 0.38-0.56). Lancefield group F alone or accompanied by the caramel smell had a specificity of 100%, but a sensitivity of only 47.3% for group F alone, and 19.5% for group F accompanied by the caramel smell. There was no significant association between species, Lancefield group, and severity of infection, site of infection, or pathogenicity. SDS-PAGE analysis failed to discriminate between strains. CONCLUSIONS: Neither species nor Lancefield antigen was related to the site of infection. The presence of Lancefield group F antigen alone or accompanied by a caramel smell was a useful indicator for the S milleri group when present, but was too insensitive to use as a screening test. Most streptococci occurring in pure culture or in significant growth density were of clinical importance. Such organisms should be identified to species level to detect the S milleri group.

TI  - Group A and group B streptococcal vaccine development. A round table presentation.
AB  - The data presented above provide a broad overview of ongoing work to develop vaccines against group A and group B streptococcal infections. The encouraging results of human trials with conjugate group B polysaccharide vaccines suggest that this approach will lead to a safe and effective method for preventing these devastating infections in newborn infants. The results of preclinical studies of the various strategies to develop group A streptococcal vaccines are also encouraging. Whether one approach will be more advantageous or efficacious than another will need to await clinical trials. Nevertheless, we predict that in the next decade we will make significant strides in preventing streptococcal infections and their complications.

TI  - A clinical study of beta-haemolytic groups A, B, C and G streptococcal bacteremia in adults over an 8-year period.
AB  - All of the 88 episodes of beta-haemolytic streptococcal bacteremia (2.9% of all bacteremias) in adult patients during the years 1987-94 in a university hospital were reviewed. 38 bacteremias (43%) were caused by group A, 24 (27%) by group B, 3 (4%) by group C, and 23 (26%) by group G beta-haemolytic streptococcal. There was a statistically significant increase in group A and decrease in group C and G bacteremias (p < 0.02) compared to an earlier 8-year period in the same hospital, although the total number of streptococcal bacteremias remained the same. The most common T types of group A streptococcal strains were T11 (26%), T28 (14%), T6 and T1 (11% each), and T12 (8%). Cardiovascular disease, skin lesions, malignancy, and alcohol abuse were the most common underlying conditions. The most usual types of infection were skin (47%) and respiratory tract infections (23%). The overall mortality was 16%. It was highest in group A (24%) and lowest in group C (0%), 38% of patients with pneumonia died. All streptococcal strains were sensitive to penicillin, vancomycin, and cephalosporins. 11% of group A and 12% of all the strains had decreased sensitivity to erythromycin, 14 and 38% to tetracycline, and 0 and 2% to clindamycin, respectively.
TI  - Unraveling the mysteries of streptococci and their relations with the host.
AB  
TI  - Comparative susceptibility of clinical group A, B, C, F, and G beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates to 24 antimicrobial drugs.
AB  - A total of 312 clinical beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates (Streptococcus pyogenes, group A = 63; Streptococcus agalactiae, group B = 145; group C = 50; group F = 27; group G = 27) were examined for susceptibility to 23 and 24 antimicrobial drugs with the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion and the agar dilution method, respectively. Sheep blood Mueller-Hinton agar served as the reference medium. Wilkins-Chalgren agar supported optimal growth of group A and B, but not of all group C, F, and G streptococci. The group A streptococci were susceptible to all beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, but resistant to cotrimoxazole, fusidic acid, and, except for 2 strains, to fosfomycin. Resistance (R)/intermediate susceptibility (I) rates (R/I%) to ciprofloxacin (0/2%), ofloxacin (1/2%), erythromycin (1.6/0%), and clarithromycin (0/1%) were low. Higher resistance rates were noted with tetracyclines (doxycycline 23.8/15.9%; tetracycline 39.7/3.2%). Among the group B streptococcal isolates, one strain was resistant against oxacillin and of intermediate susceptibility to penicillin G and cefoxitin. All isolates were susceptible to teicoplanin and rifampin. Conversely, all group B isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole and fusidic acid; 69% and 51% of these isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin and rifampin, respectively. R/I rates of the group B streptococcal isolates were low for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (0/0.7%), clindamycin (0.7/0%), erythromycin (1.4/ 3.5%), clarithromycin (1.4/0%), and chloramphenicol (0.7/0%). Resistance to tetracyclines was significant (doxycycline: 72.4/2.1%; tetracycline; 74.5/1.4%). Among the non-A, non-B beta-hemolytic streptococci, 2 group C strains were resistant to oxacillin and showed intermediate susceptibility to penicillin G. All isolates were susceptible to third and fourth-generation cephalosporins, imipenem, chloramphenicol, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin. R/I rates to the other antimicrobial drugs were: ciprofloxacin (3.9/1.9%), ofloxacin (2.9/1.9%), clindamycin (2.9/1%), erythromycin (5.8/0%), clarithromycin (3.8/2.9%), and cotrimoxazole (16.4/3.9%). Resistance against tetracyclines was more frequent (doxycycline: 18.3/2.9%; tetracycline: 20.2/6.7%). On the basis of various minor discrepancies between MIC and disk diffusion test results, it is proposed that the current NCCLS inhibition zone (diameter, mm) criteria indicative of intermediate susceptibility of beta-hemolytic streptococci be changed for the following antimicrobial drugs: ampicillin: 22-27 mm (only for group A and B beta-hemolytic streptococci); ciprofloxacin: 16-18 mm; clindamycin: 15-18 mm; doxycycline: 17-19 mm; tetracycline: 17-19 mm, and erythromycin: 14-19 mm.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacterial complications of primary varicella in children.
AB  - Bacterial complications of varicella in 84 patients younger than 16 years of age  (48 females; median age, 2.9 years) who required hospitalization between 1985 and 1995 were retrospectively analyzed. The purpose of the study was to describe demographics, clinical manifestations, bacteriology, and factors affecting outcome. Seventy-six percent of patients were younger than 5 years of age. The eldest children in households were significantly underrepresented (P = .00025). Skin infections occurred in 61 patients (73%), and deep-seated infections and/or shock occurred in 23 (27%). The latter complications were significantly associated with thrombocytopenia (P = .011) and bacteremia (P = .014) at the time of admission, prolonged fever (P = .001), prolonged hospitalization (P < .0001), intensive care management (P < .0001), and fatal outcome (P = .019). Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (59% of isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (28%) were the predominant isolates. Before and after 1990, five (31%) of 16 and 13 (62%) of 21 streptococcal complications, respectively, were invasive infections (P = .09). These data underscore the need for universal immunization against chickenpox.
TI  - Management of staphylococcal and streptococcal infections.
AB  - Staphylococcus and streptococcus are bacteria commonly found on the skin and in the mucous membrane. These bacteria are frequently associated with mild cutaneous infections but may invade to cause deeper infections including necrotizing soft-tissue infections, sepsis with or without metastatic lesions, and immunologic or toxin associated sequelae. Early recognition and timely intervention are the hallmarks of appropriate management. Initial empiric therapy should be directed towards a broad spectrum of pathogens that include staphylococcus and streptococcus.
TI  - Occurrence of extracellular hyaluronic acid and hyaluronatlyase in streptococci of groups A, B, C, and G.
AB  - Streptococci of serological groups A (GAS), B (GBS), C (GCS) and G (GGS) were examined in vitro using an optimized medium in respect of their ability to produce hyaluronic acid (HA) and hyaluronatlyase (HY). In this study, 614 GAS (including 123 streptococcal toxic shock syndrome strains, STSS), 247 GBS, 225 GCS and 143 GGS were investigated in qualitative and quantitative tests. Only 4% of GAS and 2.7% of GCS were able to express HA. In contrast to GAS, isolates of GCS showed a highly specific HA formation (to 1 g HA/g dry biomass). In all strains of GBS and GGS, not even a single isolate was positive for HA. HY expression was detectable in all four serological groups. In GAS, only 12.5% of strains were positive; the most common types being 22 and 4, whereas in GBS, GCS and GGS, 72.1%, 84% and 85.3% of isolates, respectively, could be reported as positive. The data suggest that the HA capsule only plays a secondary role in infections caused by GAS strains pathogenic for humans.
TI  - Antagonism of teicoplanin and vancomycin activity by chocolatized Mueller-Hinton  agar.
AB  - Chocolatized (80 degrees C, 13 min) Mueller-Hinton agar antagonized the inhibitory activities of teicoplanin and vancomycin against reference strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. This antagonism was due to heat-exposed sheep erythrocytes, sheep hemoglobin, and the supernatant fluid from lysed sheep erythrocytes, but not to sheep serum. Neither water-soluble cholesterol, bovine albumin, bovine serum, hematin, hemin nor egg yolk suspension antagonized teicoplanin and vancomycin.
TI  - Conservation of the C5a peptidase genes in group A and B streptococci.
AB  - The chromosome of group B streptococci (GBS) contains a gene which is related to  the C5a peptidase gene (scpA) of group A streptococci (GAS). scpA encodes a surface-associated peptidase (group A streptococcal C5a peptidase [SCPA]) which specifically cleaves C5a, a major chemoattractant generated in serum by activation of complement. The entire scpA-like gene (scpB) was cloned from a GBS strain and sequenced. The gene encodes an open reading frame of 3,450 bp, which corresponds to a deduced protein (SCPB) of 1,150 amino acids with a molecular weight of 126,237 Da. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of SCPB were found to be highly homologous to those of SCPAs from GAS. Unexpectedly, scpA12 is more similar to scpB than to another GAS gene, scpA49. The sequence 5' of the open reading frame, including transcription start and a termination site in the signal sequence, is also similar to that of scpA, although less conserved than the coding sequences. The near identity of GBS and GAS peptidases is consistent with horizontal transmission of the scp gene between these species. Recombinant SCPB was expressed in Escherichia coli by using the expression vector plasmid pGEX-4T-1 and was shown to be identical in size to the enzyme extracted from the parental GBS strain 78-471.

AB  - We report three cases of streptococci cellulitis of the hand. The characteristic  clinical presentation suggested streptococcus infection; locoregional edema, rash, echymosis, phlyctena and signs of finger ischemia. Operative findings also suggested streptococcus infection: swelling of brownish subcutaneous tissue and local thrombus formation. There was no true pus formation. Streptococcus was identified in all 3 cases. Emergency surgical treatment is needed. The portal is opened, followed by extensive fasciotomy and debridement of all necrosed tissue. Partial suture is indicated. Antibiotics can be used as an adjunct but are not sufficient alone.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. The in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. Cefetamet killed 100% Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae at < or = 0.5 mg/l, S. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l. Moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective against Escherichia coli (94%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), K. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against Moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x MIC demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and K. pneumoniae within 6 h and S. pneumoniae within 4 h. Hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to TEM1 and SHV1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Various new pathogens in pneumonia].
AB  - The table summarizes the many newly recognized agents causing lower respiratory tract infections: gram + cocci, Streptococcus agalactiae, enterococci; gram-rods, acinetobacter, Aeromonas hydrophila, Eikenella corrodens; Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to multiple drugs, intracellular organisms and viruses. Some details are given in four chapters: Pneumococci resistant to penicillin G which must be detected and impose new therapeutic strategies; Chlamydia pneumoniae with its difficulties for the diagnosis and the absence of standardized therapeutic trials; Streptococcus pyogenes with a recrudescence of severe and invasive infections, TSS and virulence factors; the pulmonary Hantavirus syndrome with 105 patients recognized (mortality 52%) in the USA and Canada, the homeland of the deermouse (Peromiscus maniculatus).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of S-1090, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - S-1090, a new oral cephalosporin, was active against selected gram-negative bacteria and methicillin-susceptible clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus warneri, against which it had excellent activity. S-1090 was the most active compound against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae among the agents compared. The in vivo efficacy of S-1090 against systemic and urinary and respiratory tract infections caused by gram-positive and -negative bacteria was superior to that expected from the in vitro and in vivo activities of the agents against which it was compared.
TI  - Invasion of cultured human cells by Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The invasive capacity of streptococcal strains belonging to groups A and B was evaluated by infecting human epithelial and endothelial cells and monitoring the number of viable intracellular bacteria at different times postinfection. All strains tested entered eukaryotic cells (HeLa, HEp2 and HUVE), with Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting a higher invasion efficiency than group B streptococci (GBS). No intracellular multiplication was observed, and GBS remained viable 24 h postinfection, whereas S. pyogenes were gradually killed. We found that cytochalasin D almost completely inhibited internalization of all bacterial strains, whereas colchicine had no effect, indicating that host microfilaments play a major role in bacterial internalization. Moreover, the use of the lysosomotropic agent ammonium chloride enabled us to demonstrate that a pH increase in the intracellular vesicles did not affect streptococcal entry. These results were documented by electron microscopic observations which revealed the different steps in the invasion pathway, including a fusion event between phagosomes containing S. pyogenes and lysosomes.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - [Bacteremia caused by group A and B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus in adults].
AB  - In order to know the epidemiological, clinical and evolutive characteristics of bacteriemia caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci groups A and B, a retrospective investigation was undertaken of 48 bacteremic episodes observed in adult patients for 10 years (1985-1994). Twenty-two episodes were caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) and 26 by Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS). Patients with GAS bacteremia (GASB) had a lower mean age than patients with GBS bacteremia (GBSB) (p = 0.03). Infection with immunodeficiency virus was more common in patients with GASB than in patients with GBSBA (27 and 4%, respectively; p = 0.04); in contrast, diabetes mellitus was more common in patients with GBSB than in patients with GASB (27 and 5%, respectively) (p = 0.04). Nine (41%) patients with GBSB were i.v. drug abusers; nevertheless, none of the subjects with GBSB were i.v. drug abusers (p < 0.001). The proportion of bacteremia without demonstrable source due to GBS (41%) was significantly higher than that due to GAS (9%) (p = 0.02). Five (23%) patients with GASB and other five (20%) patients with GBSB had fatal outcomes, but only in two (9%) and three (12%) cases, respectively, was death directly attributed to bacteremia. In conclusion, bacteremias caused by GAS and GBS have different epidemiological characteristics but similar prognosis.
TI  - A 13-year survey of bacteraemia due to beta-haemolytic streptococci in a Danish county.
AB  - During 1981-1993, 229 episodes of bacteraemia due to beta-haemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, C and G were diagnosed in the County of Northern Jutland, Denmark. The annual rates for bacteraemia were quite constant during the 13-year period for each streptococcal group. Group A streptococcal (GAS) bacteraemia was the most frequent, comprising 1.4% of all bacteraemias. The incidence of GAS bacteraemia was 1.8/100,000/year in children < 5 years of age and 4.7/100,000/year in patients > 60 years old. With the notable exception of group B streptococcal (GBS) bacteraemia in neonates, beta-haemolytic streptococci of groups B, C (GCS) and G (GGS) were isolated mostly from elderly patients. Except for GBS bacteraemia in neonates, approximately one-third of the bacteraemias in each group was nosocomially acquired. Predisposing factors included operative procedures in GAS and GCS bacteraemia, and diabetes mellitus in GBS bacteraemia. The skin was the most common primary focus in GAC, GCC and GGS bacteraemias, whereas the urinary tract was the commonest focus in GBS bacteraemia in adults. The mortality rates in GAS, GCS, GGS, and adult GBS bacteraemia were 23%, 16%, 17% and 19%, respectively. Of the 23 fatal cases of GAS bacteraemia, 57% died within 24 h after blood cultures had been obtained.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Main infectious agents involved in the etiology of lung diseases of small ruminants in northern Cameroon].
AB  - Between 1990 and 1992, 91 necropsies of small ruminants affected with pulmonary illness led to the isolation of the following strains of Mycoplasma (M.): M. mycoides subsp. mycoides LC, M. ovipneumoniae, M. agalactiae, M. sp. type D2 and M. arginini. Eleven Pasteurella multocida strains (serotypes A1, A3, A5, A7 and D2) and 11 Pasteurella haemolytica strains (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) were isolated. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Bacillus sp. and Mycobacterium sp. were also isolated. Thirty-two antibiograms were performed on Pasteurella, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and Actinomyces pyogenes strains. Eighty eight p. cent were sensitive to penicillin G and oxytetracycline, and 84% to chloramphenicol; 50% were not sensitive to spiramycin and 47% to streptomycin. One Capripoxvirus strain was isolated on sheep. Pest of small ruminants (PPR) virus was detected by immunocapture ELISA test performed on some lung samples. Two serological surveys, one for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (898 goats), between 1991 and 1993, and one for PPR (902 sheep and goats) in 1993, were conducted in the North and Far North provinces. No antibody against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia was detected. Among the animals in the sample, PPR prevalence was 64 +/- 7% in the Far North province and 14 +/- 3% in the North province. Concerning control measures, a vaccination campaign against small ruminant pasteurellosis appears to be hardly feasible because of the antigenic diversity of the isolated Pasteurella strains. PPR is endemic especially in the Far North province. The efficiency of a vaccination campaign against PPR must be estimated with a field survey.
TI  - Arcanobacterium haemolyticum and streptococcal pharyngitis in army conscripts.
AB  - Arcanobacterium haemolyticum was found in 1.4% and beta-haemolytic streptococci in 23% of throat cultures from army conscripts with sore throat (n = 498). 38% of the beta-haemolytic streptococci were of group A. Patients culture-positive for A. haemolyticum or beta-haemolytic streptococci had pharyngeal exudate, cervical lymphadenopathy and ear ache significantly more often--but cough less often--than culture-negative patients. The pharyngeal colonization rate of healthy conscripts (n = 232) by A. haemolyticum was 0.4% and by beta-haemolytic streptococci, 6.5%.

TI  - Lectin typing of beta-haemolytic streptococci of groups A and B.
AB  - Patterns of agglutination of 124 clinical isolates of beta-haemolytic streptococci (30 group A and 94 group B isolates) by 21 commercial lectins are reported. Cell suspensions were untreated. Nine (30%) of the group A isolates, and 23 (24%) of the group B isolates, were agglutinated by at least one of the lectins. Ten different patterns of agglutination were observed with group A and 15 with group B streptococci. No pattern, except that of non-agglutination by any lectin, was common to group A and group B isolates. In view of the growing interest in the use of lectin typing there is a need for standardisation of assay procedures to enable meaningful comparison of the results of different research groups.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - [An epidemiological study of group A, B, C and G hemolytic streptococci isolated  from elementary school children in the recent 12 years. Part II. Susceptibility to antibiotics. Streptococcal Diseases Study Group].
AB  - During a 12-years period between 1980 and 1992, 5,023 strains of hemolytic streptococci were detected from throats of school children, and described in part I. Among them, the following strains their susceptibility were tested to 14 kinds of antibiotics; 1,511 strains of group A, 1,038 of group B, 125 of group C, 553 of group G. 1. No resistant strains against both penicillins (PCG, AMPC, ABPC, ACPC) and cephems (CER, CET, CCL, CEX) could be found. Strains of group B were less susceptible than the others to penicillins and cephems. 2. Some resistant strains were found against macrolides (EM, OL & JM), 5.9-8.6%. These resistant strains belonged many to group A and a few to group B & G. Since 1983, the gradual decrease of the resistant strains was noted though few were found after 1986. 3. To TC a number of resistant strains were detected in group A, B, C & G through this study, (12.5-48.4%). 4. To CP some resistant strains were found from 1980 to 1985 among group A, B & G, 3.0-5.1%. Since 1986, the sharp decrease of the resistant strains was noted. 5. Multiresistant strains to TC, CP and macrolides were found since 1980 to 1982. They were found in many of group A and a few of group B and G, but after 1986 decreased sharply. 6. Most of the multiresistant strains of group A belonged to serotype T-12 and group B to serotype Ia. Ia/c, III and III/R. 7. Among the strains of group A type T-13, there were many resistant strains to TC. The rate of resistant occupied over 60% from 1980 to 1986, but decreased slightly thereafter.
TI  - [An epidemiological study of group A, B, C, and G hemolytic streptococci isolated from elementary school children in the recent 12 years. Part I. Isolation trends. Streptococcal Diseases Study Group].
AB  - During a 12-years period between September, 1980 and November, 1992, hemolytic streptococci (group A, B, C, & G) in throats of healthy school children in Osaka were examined every other month. The results were summarized as follows. 1. 5,023 strains of hemolytic streptococci were detected from 11,647 specimens, 43.1%. Among them, 2,395 strains (20.6%) belonged to group A, 1,647 (14.4%) to group B, 767 (6.6%) to group G and 187 (1.6%) to group C. 2. In the first half of the research, group A streptococci were detected predominantly and the last half, group B generally. Both this lower rate of group A to the total strains (47.7%) and this higher rate of group B (33.3%) were due to the small number of lower school grade children from whom group A streptococci are often detected and also due to application of the selective enrichment medium. 3. Group A streptococci were classified T-type. The most common serotype was T-1, and 638 strains (26.6%) were detected, followed by T-12, 377 (15.7%), T-6, 210 (8.8%) and T-13, 203 (8.5%). The dominant serotype was exchanged annually, but only T-1 was the most common serotype for 4 years (1983-1986). 4. In group B, the most common serotype was Ia, and 524 strains (31.3%) were detected, followed by III, 417 (24.9%), Ib, 164 (9.8%), III/R, 130 (7.8%) and Ia/c 122 (7.3%). Annual changes of serotype were as follows; Ia was dominant from 1980 to 1988, III from 1989 to 1990 and NT6 in 1991-1992 generally.
TI  - Penetration of ceftriaxone into the intervertebral disc.
AB  - Concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. The mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. The mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. These drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus; for Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired Enterobacteriaceae. The average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. The lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
TI  - The type I macrophage scavenger receptor binds to gram-positive bacteria and recognizes lipoteichoic acid.
AB  - Macrophage scavenger receptors exhibit unusually broad binding specificity for polyanionic ligands and have been implicated in atherosclerosis and various host defense functions. Using a radiolabeled, secreted form of the type I bovine macrophage scavenger receptor in an in vitro binding assay, we have found that this receptor binds to intact Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus hirae, and Listeria monocytogenes. Competition binding studies using purified lipoteichoic acid, an anionic polymer expressed on the surface of most Gram-positive bacteria, show that lipoteichoic acids are scavenger receptor ligands and probably mediate binding of the receptor to Gram-positive bacteria. Lipoteichoic acids, for which no host cell receptors have previously been identified, are implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock due to Gram-positive bacteria. Scavenger receptors may participate in host defense by clearing lipoteichoic acid and/or intact bacteria from tissues and the circulation during Gram-positive sepsis. Since scavenger receptors have been previously shown to bind to and facilitate bloodstream clearance of Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), these receptors may provide a general mechanism for macrophage recognition and internalization of pathogens and their cell surface components.

TI  - [Therapy of clinically apparent forms of mastitis in lactating dairy cows using intra-mammary Sulphamycin (Polfa, PR)].
AB  - Sulphamycin (Polfa, Poland) is an intramammary preparation for the treatment of clinically apparent forms of mastitis in dairy cows. Its effects were observed in 141 dairy cows treated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The animals were selected after clinical examination of the mammary gland and bacteriological examination of udder secreta. In 37 subclinically diseased cows the efficiency of treatment depended on the infectious agent and amounted to 85.2, 77.8, 73.3 and 60.0%, Streptococcus agalactiae beta-haemolytical Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium pyogenes being the respective pathogens. In 61 cows with acute mastitis the efficiency of the preparation reached 71.2, 78.3, 61.7 and 80.9% in the cases induced by S. agalactiae, beta-haemolytical Streptococci, S. aureus and Escherichia coli, respectively. Forty-three cows were treated for acute mastitis and concomitant alteration of the general health state; in these cases, S. agalactiae, S. aureus and E. coli were identified as the infectious agents and the respective therapeutic efficiency presented 62.5, 69.8 and 76.2%. S. agalactiae and beta-haemolytical Streptococci responded most sensitively to erythromycin whereas S. aureus and E. coli proved to be septrin- and streptomycin-sensitive, respectively.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Agar disk diffusion (Bauer-Kirby) tests with various fastidious and nonfastidious reference (ATCC) strains: comparison of several agar media.
AB  - Several agar media (Mueller-Hinton agar, MHA; diagnostic sensitivity test agar, DSTA; Schaedler agar, SchA; Todd-Hewitt agar with added yeast extract, THYA; Wilkins-Chalgren agar, WCA) were compared using the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion test against six nonfastidious quality control strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212. MHA, DSTA, and THYA yielded essentially comparable inhibition zones. However, WCA and SchA antagonized cotrimoxazole and aminoglycoside antibiotics; furthermore, SchA antagonized polymyxin B, and both WCA and SchA antagonized imipenem against the P. aeruginosa strain, but not against the E. coli strains. Sheep blood-MHA (Bl-MHA), WCA, THYA, and DSTA were examined with Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6306. In comparison with Bl-MHA, both WCA and THYA yielded comparable inhibition zones against S. pyogenes; DSTA afforded suboptimal growth. DSTA yielded larger inhibition zones with the majority of antimicrobial drugs against S. agalactiae, whereas WCA and THYA enhanced the activity of oxacillin and penicillin G against this strain. S. pneumoniae strain ATCC 6306 grew well on Bl-MHA, yielded suboptimal growth on WCA and faint growth on THYA, and failed to grow on DSTA. Chocolate-supplemented sheep blood-MHA (CHOC-MHA) was compared with Haemophilus test medium (HTM), WCA with added NAD, and THYA with added hematin and NAD against Haemophilus influenzae strains ATCC 35056 and ATCC 49247. The activities of doxycycline and rifampin were enhanced against both strains by HTM, WCA+NAD, and THYA+hematin+NAD. Only WCA+NAD antagonized cotrimoxazole against both H. influenzae strains, an effect due to thymidine; however, HTM antagonized cotrimoxazole against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 25922. It was concluded that Bl-MHA performed best for beta-hemolytic streptococci quality control strains. Likewise, CHOC-MHA was optimal for the two H. influenzae strains used in this comparative agar disk diffusion study.
TI  - Toxic shock syndrome toxin-secreting Staphylococcus aureus in Kawasaki syndrome.
AB  - Kawasaki syndrome (KS), the main cause of acquired heart disease in children, is  associated with the selective expansion of V beta 2+ T cells in peripheral blood. Our study suggests that KS may be caused by a superantigen--a staphylococcal or streptococcal toxin. Bacteria were cultured without knowledge of their origin, from the throat, rectum, axilla, and groin of 16 patients with untreated acute KS and 15 controls. Bacteria producing toxins were isolated from 13 of 16 KS patients but from only 1 of 15 controls (p < 0.0001). Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) secreting Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 11 of the 13 toxin-positive cultures, and streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin (SPE) B and C were found in the other 2. These toxins are known to stimulate V beta 2+ T cells. All TSST-producing KS isolates were tryptophan auxotrophs indicating they were clonally related. S aureus isolates from acute KS patients were unusual because they produced less lipase, haemolysin, and protease compared to other isolates (p < 0.01). S aureus colonies from KS patients were white, and could be easily mistaken for coagulase-negative staphylococci, whereas colonies of non-KS isolates were gold. These observations suggest that the expansion of V beta 2+ T cells in most patients with KS may be caused by a new clone of TSST-producing S aureus, and, in a minority of patients, SPEB-producing or SPEC-producing streptococci.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 138312 and PD 140248, new fluoronaphthyridines with outstanding gram-positive potency.
AB  - PD 138312 and PD 140248 are new quinolones with high in vitro activities against  a wide spectrum of bacterial species, notably including gram-positive isolates. The respective MICs (in micrograms per milliliter) of PD 138312 and PD 140248 capable of inhibiting > or = 90% of the strains were < or = 0.06 and < or = 0.06 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococci, streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 0.125 and 0.03 for Legionella pneumophila; 0.25 and 0.125 for Listeria monocytogenes; 0.25 and 0.25 for Enterococcus faecalis; 0.5 and 0.06 for anaerobic gram-positive cocci; 0.5 and 0.25 for Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 and 0.5 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (excluding Serratia marcescens); 2 and 0.5 for Bacteroides fragilis; 2 and 2 for Serratia marcescens and ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci; and 8 and 4 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Separation and isolation of viable bacteria by capillary zone electrophoresis.
AB  - Mixtures of bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Streptococcus pyogenes  (ATCC 19615), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 13813), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6303), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), were resolved into discrete electrophoretic bands using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Bacteria remained viable (> 90%) during the electrophoretic process. Analysis of peak separation indicates organisms were quantitatively resolved and recovered at greater than 98% purity. E. faecalis was resolved into two discrete fractions with different chain assemblages that may reflect different developmental stages. These findings suggest that CZE can afford the microbiologist a new tool for studying the composition and distribution of microorganisms in mixed populations.
TI  - Streptococcal update. A microbiology perspective.
AB  - The streptococci remain important human pathogens despite it being nearly 60 years since sulphonamides were introduced. Rheumatic fever and post glomerulonephritis are common diseases in the Aboriginal community, and a new invasive disease, toxic shock-like syndrome, is also caused by Group A Streptococcus. Group B, first described over 50 years ago in obstetric wards remains the primary neonatal pathogen despite attempts to eliminate this organism from the genital tract of the carrier mother. A major concern in paediatrics is the relatively poor response to the current pneumococcal vaccines. Australian researchers are playing a major role in developing a new vaccine with high antigenicity against all of the 100 odd serotypes of S pneumoniae. The oral streptococci are now recognised as important opportunistic pathogens and the pathogenesis is well defined. Disturbing reports from different geographical regions alert us to the antibiotic resistance in some of the streptococci once thought of as sensitive bacteria, for example, Group A has shown resistance to erythromycin, the pneumococcus to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics and the aminoglycosides have been ineffective against the enterococci due to plasmid-borne genes.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Group B streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome: report of a case and purification of an associated pyrogenic toxin.
AB  - A patient with streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) caused by Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) is described. The patient had all of the defining criteria for toxic shock syndrome (TSS), including fever, hypotension, erythematous rash, desquamation, and involvement of multiple organs. Neither Staphylococcus aureus nor group A streptococci were recovered, but vaginal and urine cultures yielded group B streptococci. The group B streptococcal isolate gave negative results in antibody tests for the production of TSS toxin 1, staphylococcal enterotoxins, and streptococcal scarlet fever toxins. However, the strain produced a novel pyrogenic toxin. This toxin, purified from culture fluids by ethanol precipitation, isoelectric focusing, and reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, had a molecular weight of 12,000 and an isoelectric point of approximately 7.0. The purified toxin was pyrogenic in rabbits, enhanced the susceptibility of the animals to lethal endotoxin shock, and caused the proliferation of rabbit splenocytes; these properties define pyrogenic toxins. When given to three rabbits via a subcutaneous miniosmotic pump, the toxin caused TSS-like symptoms ending in death. Three additional group B streptococcal strains from patients with TSLS were tested and were found to produce a toxin with similar properties.
TI  - Prevalence of IgA receptors in clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae: serologic distinction between the receptors by blocking antibodies.
AB  - Group A and B streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae)  are the only known bacterial pathogens expressing IgA Fc-receptors. However, the IgA binding proteins of the two species have been found genetically unrelated. In the present investigation the binding of human IgA among clinical isolates of group A and group B streptococci was studied and the respective IgA-binding epitopes were compared serologically. Surface binding of radiolabelled, monoclonal human IgA1 occurred in 38% of 115 unselected group A streptococcal isolates. Comparing four predominant T-types, IgA-binding was found in 77% and 85%, respectively, of types T4 and T28 strains but only in 5% and 25%, respectively, of T1 and T12 strains. In group B streptococci, 70% of 58 type Ib strains but only 2% of 399 strains of other serotypes bound IgA. Using rabbit immune sera raised to the two streptococcal species it was found that strains exhibiting IgA Fc-receptors often induced antibodies blocking the binding of IgA to bacteria. Furthermore, the blocking shown by an individual serum was restricted to the streptococcal group used for immunization showing that also the IgA-binding eptiopes in group A and B streptococci are conformationally distinct. Though infections with serotypes often binding IgA, compared to other types, are not known to differ, it is assumed that the non-immune binding of IgA might favour mucosal colonization of the organisms.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - The microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  - Basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of Streptococcaceae are given. Identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, Lancefield group C and G streptococci, S. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (Lancefield grouping). Rapid antigen tests for the detection of group A and B streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. The reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. The elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group A and B streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. Recently employed examples include the M protein gene typing of group A streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of PCR assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. Restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial DNA in association with DNA fragment separation by conventional or PFGE have been applied successfully to several species of Streptococcaceae (e.g., S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae). Enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe underlying disease. Molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. E. faecalis and E. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. The definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. The increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. All enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in E. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Septicemia caused by A, B, C and G groups of beta-hemolytic streptococci].
AB  - During a five and a half years' period, 805 strains of beta-haemolytic groups A,  B, C and G streptococci were isolated. Among these, 28 were responsible for bacteremia; 57 percent group B and 32 percent group A. All strains were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics; 4 strains were resistant to macrolides. The majority of patients had underlying diseases. Mortality was high in this group.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of the termini and chromosomal locus involved in site-specific integration of the streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn5252.
AB  - The 47-kb, broad-host-range, streptococcal conjugative transposon Tn5252 is capable of site-specific integration into the pneumococcal chromosome. We present the nucleotide sequence of the terminal regions of the transposon and its target site in the pneumococcal genome. No inverted repeats were found at the termini of the transposon. A 72-bp region of the target was present on either side following the insertion of Tn5252 and appeared to serve as a signal for its integration and excision. The data suggest that the left copy of the 72-bp segment was a part of the conjugative element, the crossover point of integration was nonrandom within this region, and the mechanism of insertion could resemble that of the site-specific temperate phages.
TI  - Streptococci and the genital tract.
AB  - Streptococci of Lancefield Group B (GBS) are known to cause maternal sepsis and neonatal infection, whereas streptococci Lancefield Group A (GAS) cause vulvo-vaginitis in both children and adults. Prevalence of SGB colonization of the lower genital tract of normal women is between 4-18%, with higher rates found in hospital personnel and delivery rooms. Such high carriage rates may be a significant factor in nosocomial transmission of GBS to neonates. Symptomatic infection is uncommon and usually secondary to other pathological states. Amnionitis is a complication of vaginal carriage of GBS and there is now evidence that chorioamnionitis is associated with pre-term labour and its attendant problems. GBS infection of the male genitalia has also been described. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis has been shown to prevent early onset GBS disease of the neonate. Prevalence of GAS in the genital tract is lower than that for GBS, but is more likely to be symptomatic. The response to penicillin is usually prompt. Optimal drug regimens need to be determined, particularly for use in pregnancy.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effects of miocamycin, roxithromycin and erythromycin on Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The 16-membered macrolide miocamycin (MOM) has been compared with the 14-membered compounds erythromycin and roxithromycin in terms of causing post-antibiotic effects (PAE). Five strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 3 Streptococcus pyogenes, 3 S. agalactiae and 3 enterococci, of differing phenotypes of resistance to erythromycin, were tested. PAE were measured follwonig exposure of cocci to 1 x, 3 x and 10 x MICs of each antibiotic. Against the staphylococci and group A streptococci the three macrolides gave similar results, PAE of 1- h at 1 x MIC, 2-4 h at 3 x MIC and > 4 h at 10 x MIC being observed. For group B streptococci and the only erythromycin-sensitive enterococcus tested, PAE due to MOM were at least double those due to erythromycin or roxithromycin, at each concentration tested. MOM produced significant PAE for the strains that were inducibly resistant to erythromycin and roxithromycin.
TI  - Cefprozil. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  - Cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. It is particularly active against the Gram-positive organisms Streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. Cefprozil is also moderately active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, many Enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. In comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. Cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. In children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. The most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. Thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. While cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.
TI  - Immunodiagnosis of group-A streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  - Seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-A streptococci were generated. All of them were of IgM isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-A streptococci and polysaccharide. These were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-B, -C, -G and Staphylococcus aureus. Polyclonal antibodies against group-A polysaccharide (APS) were also raised in rabbits by linking APS to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. Latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. The assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng APS/ml as compared to 1 microgram APS/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. Both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-B, -C, -G, Staph. aureus, Cornybacterium diptheriae, Candida albicans, Candida spp., Morexella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Strep. pneumoniae. Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi A and B. Throat swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-A, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic analysis of the unidirectional theta replication of the S. agalactiae plasmid pIP501.
AB  - pIP501 is a broad-host-range plasmid originating from Streptococcus agalactiae. In this report we show that (i) it replicates by a theta mechanism initiating at the 3' end of the gene encoding the replication protein RepR and progressing in the direction of transcription of this gene; (ii) its replication origin lies within or a few nucleotides downstream from ORF R and not upstream from it as suggested in the literature (Brantl et al. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 4783-4789); (iii) the RepR protein positively regulates pIP501 copy number; and (vi) the main function ensured by the sequences located upstream from ORF R is to express this ORF. Since the replication properties of pIP501 are indistinguishable from those of the highly related Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1, we conclude that these elements form the first family of theta replicating plasmids in gram-positive bacteria. Based on sequence similarities, we extend this family to the S. pyogenes plasmid pSM19035 and to 12 other plasmids isolated from streptococci or enterococci.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - Comparison of skin changes induced on mice by either group A type 12 or group G streptococci.
AB  - Adult Swiss webster mice were injected with 3 x 10(6) colony-forming units (cfu)  of group G or 2.5 x 10(6) cfu of group A streptococci at intradermal injection sites on the right and left paralumbar areas of the back. The mice were sacrificed at intervals between 4 hours and 14 days post-injection (p.i.) and full thickness biopsies of skin 10 mm in diameter encompassing the sites of injection were taken. One tissue specimen was homogenized in PBS and plated to determine the number of cfu, while another was used for histopathological studies. The number of viable group A and group G streptococci in the tissue increased to 3 x 10(9) cfu by 96 hours p.i.: after 192 hours p.i. the group A cells had declined to 2.7 x 10(6) cfu compared to 1.1 x 10(8) cfu for group G cells. No streptococci of either group were detected at 336 hours (14 days p.i.). Gross edematous lesions induced by either streptococcus group were evident on all animals at 24 hours (p.i.). Group G streptococci lesions were larger and persisted longer than lesions induced by group A. Histological examination consistently revealed more inflammation and necrosis in tissue sections from mice injected with group G streptococci.
TI  - Antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). Meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Only one strain each of Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. Of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens. Both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacteroides sp. All other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout Japan. Possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (RKM) were examined against these isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined through a comparative study with reference drugs. The results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. Resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (MLs) with MIC values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. Staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring MLs with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (EM) and clarithromycin (CAM), and 85.2% between EM and oleandomycin (OL). Fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring MLs than to 14-membered ring MLs. Cross resistances observed among the Staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (MDM-AC) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (LM)), 93.9% between MDM-AC and josamycin (JM), and 53.3% between MDM-AC and RKM. Streptococcus spp. and Peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but resistance patterns to RKM were quite different. Most of anaerobic streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring MLs, but in some cases a pattern similar to that of Staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. When ML-resistant bacteria isolated during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of Staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of Streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980, but that of Streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. Most of ML-resistances of the resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. Strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring MLs were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring MLs. RKM appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. From these results, it appears that the RKM is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of RU 29246, the active compound of the cephalosporin prodrug ester HR 916.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU 29246 was compared with those of other agents against 536 recent clinical isolates. The MICs of RU 29246 for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90s) were less than 2 micrograms/ml except those for Morganella spp. (16 micrograms/ml) and Proteus spp. (8 micrograms/ml). RU 29246 was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, < or = 8 micrograms/ml) and against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90s, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Streptococci and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were highly susceptible to RU 29246, and the activity of the agent against isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, < or = 2 micrograms/ml) was comparable to those of the other cephalosporins tested. RU 29246 was insusceptible to hydrolysis by the common plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM-1 and SHV-1). However, hydrolysis by the new extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9) was detected. Results of the study suggested that RU 29246 should be investigated clinically for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections.
TI  - Similarity between the group B and A streptococcal C5a peptidase genes.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) and group A streptococci (GAS) are known to have surface-associated peptidase activity which specifically cleaves C5a (C5a-ase), the primary chemotaxin for polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Amplification products were obtained from GBS genomic DNA template by using the polymerase chain reaction and primers corresponding to the C5a peptidase gene of GAS (scpA12). A restriction map of the GBS full-length amplified gene (scpB) was developed. The scpB restriction map was found to be highly similar to that of the analogous gene in GAS. A 50-bp deletion was located near the 5' end of scpB in a region where repeat sequences are found in scpA12. Hybridization experiments confirmed that other serotypes of GBS also carry an scpB-like gene. These results show that GBS contain a gene, scpB, which is very similar to that harbored by M12 GAS. The probability that scpB encodes the C5a-ase protein is discussed.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a surface protein-releasing activity in Streptococcus mutans and other pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - Surface proteins of Streptococcus mutans have been reported to be released into the culture filtrate at concentrations that vary with the growth conditions. The reason for this is not clear. The present study attempts to investigate the mechanism of the protein release. The results showed that whole cells and raffinose-stabilized protoplasts of S. mutans NG8, when incubated in buffers, were capable of releasing their surface proteins in a pH-dependent manner with optimal release at pH 5 to 6. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the released proteins were very complex. Two proteins, adhesin P1, which has been previously shown to interact with a human salivary agglutinin, and glucosyltransferase have been identified among the released proteins. The release of adhesin P1 and other proteins was found to be inhibited by heat, Cu2+,Zn2+, and thiol-blocking reagents. The inhibition by heat and Cu2+ was irreversible, whereas that by the thiol-blocking reagents was reversible. EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and N-p-tosyl-L-lysyl-chloromethyl ketone had no effect on the release of P1, indicating that the release was probably not due to proteolytic activity. Adhesin P1 from Cu(2+)-inactivated S. mutans NG8 protoplasts could be released by mixing with fresh whole cells and protoplasts, but not the culture filtrate, of a P1-negative mutant of NG8, suggesting that the enzyme is located on the cell surface. This P1-releasing activity was also detected in two other strains of S. mutans and one strain each of S. gordonii, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes. The biological role(s) of this enzyme activity remains to be determined. However, owing to its ability to release virulent surface proteins from the cell, it may play an important role in cell surface modulation among the pathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Preferential activation of peripheral blood V gamma 9+ gamma/delta T cells by group A, B and C but not group D or F streptococci.
AB  - Previous studies have established that inactivated mycobacteria are potent and selective activators of V gamma 9+/V delta 2+ human gamma/delta T cells. Here we have analysed the proliferative response of human gamma/delta T cells to five serologically distinct groups of streptococci. While heat-inactivated streptococci of all five serogroups tested (A, B, C, D and F) induced a strong proliferative response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), only groups A, B and C elicited a selective activation of V gamma 9+ gamma/delta T cells in 10 (serogroup B) or 11 (serogroups A and C) of 11 tested healthy individuals. In striking contrast, groups D and F streptococci failed to activate gamma/delta T cells in nine of 11 donors and induced only a weak gamma/delta T cell response in two additional individuals. Depletion of V gamma 9+ T cells before culture completely eliminated all gamma/delta T cell responses to streptococci. These data indicate that groups A, B and C (but not D or F) streptococci can be included in the growing list of selective ligands for V gamma 9+/V delta 2+ human gamma/delta T cells.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. NAGase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of Actinomyces pyogenes (P less than 0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Similarly NAGase treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees C. NAGase did not reduce the numbers of Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. Since NAGase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.
TI  - [Epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infection].
AB  - The appearance of the "streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome" led to a growing  interest in infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group-A-streptococci). Since 1987 some 800 cases with a lethality of 20% or more were observed. Contrary to toxic scarlet fever the site of primary infection are the lower respiratory tract or soft tissue infections. Erythrogenic toxins and low molecular weight mitogens, inducing cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of these severe infections. Morphologically and culturally the strains isolated from cases of toxic shock-like syndrome cannot be differentiated from isolates of epidemic scarlet fever or sporadic cases. At the same time, when in Scandinavia an epidemic by S.pyogenes type 1 with many cases of toxic shock was observed, the same type caused a scarlet fever epidemic without complications in eastern Germany. Erythrogenic toxin type A or its toxoid, respectively, can be used for successful immunizations of rabbits. Another--antibacterial-immunization can be done with the M-protein of S.pyogenes, which is limited by its type-specificity. Streptococcal vaccination is required especially for developing countries with a high incidence of rheumatic fever. Infections due to Streptococcus agalactiae (group-B streptococci) are often underestimated though they have a first position in septicemia and meningitis of newborns. Taxonomy and nomenclature of streptococci are often changing; a list of the presently known species is presented in table I.
TI  - In-vitro activity of RP 59500, a semisynthetic streptogramin, against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of RP 59500, an injectable streptogramin derived from pristinamycin, was determined by agar dilution and compared with that of pristinamycin. Two hundred and sixty-one recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were tested against both antibiotics. The two compounds displayed similar activities. The MIC90s of RP 59500 ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/L in 114 strains of Staphylococcus aureus showing various phenotypes of antibiotic resistance (penicillin-susceptible; penicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible; methicillin-resistant; erythromycin-resistant, either inducible or constitutive; quinolone-resistant). Similar results were obtained with coagulase-negative staphylococci. RP 59500 was consistently active against streptococci, with MIC90s of 0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/L for Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 20), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 20) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20), respectively. Enterococcus faecalis (n = 20) appeared to be notably less susceptible (MIC90, 8 mg/L). In view of this consistent activity against all staphylococci and streptococci tested, including multiply resistant isolates, RP 59500 merits further investigation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - Role of streptococcal IgG Fc receptor in tissue deposition of IgG in rabbits immunized with Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Induction of anti-IgG during hyperimmunization of rabbit with Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci; GAS) was previously shown to require the presence of IgG Fc receptors (FcR) in the vaccine strain. In the present work, we examined whether streptococcal FcR activity might also be of importance for heart and kidney deposition of IgG, known to occur in poststreptococcal sequelae as well as during experimental immunization of animals. Each of three IgG-binding (GAS types M1, M12 and M22) and two non-binding (GAS type T27 and S. agalactiae (GBS) type Ia) streptococcal strains were used for intravenous immunization of rabbits during two periods of eight and six weeks, respectively, separated by an interval of one month. Before use, vaccine strains were treated with KSCN and carefully washed in order to remove any surface-bound immunoglobulins. No deaths occurred among injected rabbits. No tissue deposition was elicited by the GAS type T27 or the GBS strain. In contrast, the strains of types M1, M12 and M22 all induced deposits of IgG in kidney and heart tissue, beginning during the first immunization period. In two tested animals, receiving GAS of types M1 or M22, circulating immune complexes containing anti-IgG antibodies were also detected. Finally, serum autoantibodies reacting with preparations of heart and kidney, but not lung or liver, were demonstrated in each of six animals receiving M1 or M22, reaching maximum levels during reimmunization; such antibodies were not evoked by the two strains not binding IgG. Our results suggest that, in GAS with capacity for non-immune binding of IgG, triggering of anti-IgG acted to enhance tissue deposition of IgG or immune complexes in immunized rabbits. Furthermore tissue-specific antibodies were elicited only by the IgG-binding strains and occurred comparatively late during immunization, suggesting that those antibodies might have been triggered due to the exposition of hidden kidney and heart determinants.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new glycopeptide decaplanin.
AB  - The activity of decaplanin, a new glycopeptide, was compared to that of vancomycin, teicoplanin and daptomycin. Decaplanin was two- to four-fold less active than vancomycin, telcoplanin and daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with an MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml for methicillin-susceptible and 4 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant isolates. Decaplanin had activity similar to that of vancomycin against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, group C and G streptococci, with an MIC90 of 0.12 micrograms/ml. It was less active than the other agents against the viridans group streptococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml). The activity of decaplanin against enterococci (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) was similar to that of vancomycin. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, peptostreptococci and peptococci by 0.25 microgram/ml. Decaplanin was active from pH 5.5 to 7.5. Inoculum size had a minimal effect on MICs, and increased concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 50% serum did not alter MICs or MBCs.
TI  - [The characteristics of a Russian-made kit for the serological identification of  streptococci groups A, B and C].
AB  - The first Soviet kits for the serological identification of streptococci, groups  A, B, and C, on the basis of the coagglutination test were developed. Each kit was intended for 35-40 determinations. The optimum concentration of streptococci during their identification by means of the reagents making up the kit was about 1.6 x 10(9) cells/ml. The specificity of the reagents in comparison with the results of the identification of streptococci by reference methods was 97.3 +/- 0.9%. The reagents making up the kits can be presumably used for solving a number of practical problems in the epidemiological surveillance of streptococcal infection.
TI  - [Identification of strains of beta-hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, C, and  G by coagglutination].
AB  - A study was conducted on the coagglutination (CoA) technique in the serogrouping  of betahemolytic streptococci of the groups A, B, C and G, previously identified by physiological tests and the agar immunodiffusion technique. This technique was used as a reference test and, according to its results, it can be stated that the CoA technique allowed for the serological grouping in 95.7% of the strains. The CoA technique was assessed by using reactions prepared in our laboratories and the commercial kit Phadebact.
TI  - Effects of haemolysins of groups A and B streptococci on cardiovascular system.
AB  - Anaesthetized New Zealand white rabbits and rats were either injected or infused  with streptolysin S and group B streptococcal haemolysins in order to observe the haemodynamic actions of these haemolysins. Results showed that streptolysin S had little or no effect. In contrast, group B streptococcal haemolysin showed significant hypotensive action as manifested in rapid reduction of systolic, mean, diastolic and pulse pressures, and a limited number of deaths due to shock.
TI  - Comparative studies on binding of vitronectin and fibronectin to groups A and C streptococci.
AB  - Binding of 125I-labelled fibronectin and vitronectin to streptococci of group A (S. pyogenes), group B (S. agalactiae) and group C (S. dysgalactiae and S. zooepidemicus) isolated from various human infections and bovine mastitis, and S. uberis bovine isolates, was studied. Binding of vitronectin and fibronectin was common among both human groups A and C, and bovine group C streptococci. S. agalactiae strains of human and bovine origin as well as S. uberis bovine isolates bound low levels of both proteins. The binding of radiolabelled fibronectin and vitronectin to selected groups A and C streptococcal strains was specific, time-dependent and occurred with both live and heat-killed (80 degrees C for 15 min) cells. Binding declined rapidly after treatment of cells with trypsin or proteinase K, while pepsin digestion at pH 5.5 affected vitronectin but not fibronectin binding.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal effect of temafloxacin and tosufloxacin against streptococci].
AB  - Tosufloxacin tosylate (TOSU) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (TEMA) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered in a hospital microbiology laboratory (Bellevue Regional Teaching Hospital). Species included S. pneumoniae (n = 20), group A streptococci (n = 22), group B streptococci (n = 30), group G streptococci (n = 17), group D S. bovis (n = 19), Enterococcus faecium (n = 45), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), S. sanguis (n = 21), S. milleri (n = 29) and S. mitis (n = 17). Activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (CIP) and pefloxacin (PEF). Activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the MIC 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: TOSU, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, TEMA 0.5 to 2 mg/l, CIP, 1 to 4 mg/l and PEF 8 to 32 mgl. Overall, TOSU and TEMA exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. The size of the inoculum had no significant effect on MIC values.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical evaluations of cefdinir 10% fine granules in pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482)  (10% fine granules), a new oral cephem, were performed in pediatrics. 1. Bioequivalencies of plasma concentrations and urinary excretions of CFDN 5% and 10% fine granules were investigated on 3 pediatric patients with ages between 5 to 13 years administered with a drug in fasting state at a dose level of 3 mg/kg using a cross over method. Average plasma concentrations in a group of patients administered with 5% fine granules peaked at 3 hours after administration with a level of 1.05 +/- 0.29 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.E.) and decreased to 0.12 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml at 8 hours with a half-life of 1.48 +/- 0.09 hours. In the group administered with 10% fine granules, average plasma concentrations peaked at 2 hours after administration with a level of 1.32 +/- 0.12 micrograms/ml, and decreased to 0.20 +/- 0.11 microgram/ml at 8 hours with a half-life of 1.68 +/- 0.28 hours. The first 8-hour urinary recovery rates of CFDN in the 5% and 10% fine granules groups averaged 19.64 +/- 5.69% and 23.37 +/- 2.36%, respectively. Both average and individual plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates in the patients of the 10% fine granules group were somewhat higher than those of the 5% fine granules group, but no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups including areas under concentrations. 2. CFDN 10% fine granule preparation was administered to 33 pediatric patients with ages between 1 to 13 years with various infections, and its clinical effects, bacteriological effects and safety were assessed. In 31 of the 33 patients (2 patients were excluded since they were with non-bacterial infections) clinical effects were excellent in all of 9 patients with scarlet fever (3), acute pharyngitis (3) or impetigo (3), excellent in 12 and good in 3 of 15 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, and excellent in 4 and good in 3 of 7 patients with acute pneumonia. The overall efficacy rate was 100%. Bacteriological effects against causative organisms were evaluated. All the identified Staphylococcus aureus (4 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1) were eradicated. Of 10 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains were eradicated and the other one was reduced. Of 7 strains of Haemophilus influenzae 4 were eradicated, 1 persisted and the fate of the remaining 2 were unknown. The overall eradication rate was 90.0%. Microbial substitutions were observed in 5 patients. The new, replacing bacteria were all Haemophilus spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Pyomyositis in patients with diabetes mellitus.
AB  - Pyomyositis is a pyogenic infection of skeletal muscle that is endemic in the tropics and is being recognized with increasing frequency in temperate climates. We report two cases of nonendemic pyomyositis in patients with diabetes mellitus. A review of the literature suggests that diabetes mellitus may be an important risk factor for the development of pyomyositis. Possible mechanisms of this association are discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140, and PD 131501). A quinolone with high activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Sparfloxacin (CI-978, AT-4140 and PD 131501) is a new antimicrobial agent of the  piperazinyl quinolone class. Relative to other quinolones, it is a potent antistaphylococcal and antistreptococcal drug in vitro: The microbroth 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) (in microgram/ml) was 0.25 vs 26 methicillin-resistant and -sensitive coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci and 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae; 0.5 vs 20 strains each of S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and Enterococcus faecalis. The data indicate sparfloxacin to be generally superior to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, cefazolin, doxycycline, amikacin, and vancomycin against these Gram-positive bacterial groups. Additional MIC90s were determined for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (less than or equal to 0.03); Enterobacteriaceae (0.5); and Listeria monocytogenes (1). Activity was generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic-anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium cholate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine. Naturally occurring resistant mutants occurred at frequencies of 10(-8) or lower.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of fibrinogen on phagocytic killing of streptococcal isolates  from humans, cattle and horses.
AB  - The effects of fibrinogen on phagocytic killing of Streptococcus dysgalactiae from cattle and S. equi from horses were studied in comparison to that of S. pyogenes from humans. Phagocytic killing was determined by a fluorometric microassay using glass adherent polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) from the respective host species, preopsonization with homologous sera led to a dose-dependent increase in phagocytic killing of all streptococcal cultures, preincubation of streptococci with fibrinogen significantly inhibited their phagocytic killing. Fibrinogen had no effect on phagocytic killing of non-fibrinogen binding S. agalactiae cultures. Further characterization studies with S. dysgalactiae and S. pyogenes revealed that a partial inhibition of phagocytic killing could also be achieved by preincubation with monomeric beta-chains of fibrinogen. Digestion of the fibrinogen binding sites on streptococci with proteases resulted in an almost complete loss of the inhibitory effects of fibrinogen on phagocytic killing. It could thus be concluded that by binding fibrinogen animal pathogenic streptococci could evade phagocytic killing in a similar manner as M protein carrying S. pyogenes isolates from human infections.
TI  - [A study on hemolytic streptococci (group A, B, C and G) isolated from throat of  the middle-aged and advanced-aged--especially as compared with elementary school children].
AB  - Hemolytic streptococci were isolated from throat of middle-aged and advanced-aged and these organisms were classified into groups A, B, C and G. 1) Persons 15 to 39 years old were included in one group and persons from 40 years of age upward were divided into 5 groups every 10 years. Comparison of these groups were done. Generally, group B organisms were most often isolated. The detection rate of group B organisms was higher in the older age group. The detection rates of group A and G organisms were approximately equal, but both organisms were isolated from a few persons. No organism of group C was isolated from males, while only two strains belonged to group C organism were isolated from females. 2) A number of strains of group A hemolytic streptococci were isolated from school children, particularly in the lower classes. But the proportion of group B organism to isolated streptococci showed an increase in upper classes, noticeably in females. 3) For middle-aged and advanced-aged, blood samples were obtained simultaneously on examination of the throat, and ASO value and ASK titer were determined. ASO values were higher in persons infected with groups A, C or G organisms than in persons infected with group B organism or no hemolytic streptococcus. ASK titers revealed a similar results to ASO values, though the relation between ASK titers and isolated hemolytic streptococci was less positive.
TI  - [Comparison between the aged and children of the normal distribution of pharyngeal and intestinal hemolytic streptococci].
AB  - A marked difference between the aged and children has been observed in the group  distribution of hemolytic streptococci isolated from various clinical specimens. Group B strains from the urine and sputum, and group G from the sputum, pus and exudate have been predominant in the aged, whereas group A strains from the throat swab have dominated in children. The present study was undertaken to clarify the background for such a marked difference by investigating the normal state of pharyngeal and intestinal carriage of hemolytic streptococci both in the aged and children. 1. As to the pharyngeal carriage, quite a contrast was observed between the aged and children. In the former, the rate of carries was low and the predominant groups among the streptococcus isolates were B (Streptococcus agalactiae) and G (identified as Streptococcus equisimilis), while in the latter, the rate was high and group A (Streptococcus pyogenes) strains comprised approximately 75% of the isolates, most of them being from the throat swab. 2. Both the aged and children showed a similar state of streptococcus carriage in the intestine. The rate of carriers was low and the predominant group among the isolates was B in both populations. Although group G strains were occasionally isolated, group A strains were isolated neither in the aged nor in children. These results explain well the difference between the aged and children in the group distribution of the clinical isolates of hemolytic streptococci.
TI  - [An epidemiological survey of group A, B, C & G hemolytic streptococci isolated from the Throat of Diabetic Children Streptococcicosis Study Group].
AB  - The incidence of group A, B, C & G hemolytic streptococci residing in the throat  of children with diabetes was surveyed. The survey was carried out in August, 1982 and August, 1983. Included in the surveys were 136 diabetic children. The survey was also carried out with healthy school children at the same term as the contrast. The detection rate of the streptococci among the diabetic children was significantly higher than the healthy school children. A great portion of streptococci detected from these diabetic children was classified into group B, on the other hand, from the healthy school children, group A. Although from healthy school children, BIII, BIa and several other types were isolated, from diabetic children only BIa and BIII were isolated. The detection rate of the streptococci among the diabetic children was significantly higher in the early days in camp for improvement of diabetes than in the last day. In the latter case the detection rate was similar to that among healthy children. In the other words following antidiabetic therapy as diabetes improved the detection rate were also improved. Among these 136 diabetic children examined 31 gave positive cultures at both surveys each year. Serogroups or serotypes in each year examinations, isolates, were identical in 26 cases. Most of these groups were group B and the types were Ia and III.
TI  - [Serotypes and antibiotic sensitivity of hemolytic streptococci isolated from clinical specimens in Hiroshima Prefecture, 1987-1989].
AB  - The grouping, the typing and the drug-sensibility of hemolytic streptococci isolated from the clinical specimens taken from 4 medical centers in Hiroshima Prefecture have been examined and reviewed during the past 3 years 1987-1989. The results were summarized in this report. 1. Of 1572 strains of hemolytic streptococci, 844 strains (53.7%) were group A; 539 strains (34.3%), group B; 14 strains (0.9%), group C; 82 strains (5.2%), group G; and 93 strains (5.9%), the others. We found that group A and group B were predominant, and the incidence rate of group B was higher than it used to be. 2. The prevalent types were T-4 (37.9%), T-1 (13.6%), T-12 (12.0%), and T-28 (10.7%) in group A, while Ia (26.2%), M9 (provisional type 18.4%), and III (14.5%) in group B. 3. As far as the detection data of each month is concluded, during the summer season we could hardly detect group A which peak of occurrence during the winter season. These findings were really consistent with the occurrence pattern of those patients who suffered from streptococcal infectious disease. But this occurrence pattern couldn't be found in group B. 4. In our study, the positive frequency was throat swab greater than urine greater than sputum greater than vaginal swab greater than pus greater than ear secretion in order. Group A was mainly isolated from throat swab, while group B, from several specimens including urine. 5. We found that there was a high drug-sensibility to the beta-lactam drugs in all strains except for 3 strains of group B which were resistant to CEX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility of group A and B streptococci clinically isolated in Sapporo in the last five years].
AB  - During the last five-year period between 1985 and 1989, serotypes of 671 strains  of group A and 238 strains of group B streptococci isolated from clinical specimens in Sapporo city general hospital were studied. Results of serotyping were given as under; Type T4 (25.8%), T12 (25.6%), T1 (11.5%), T3 (9.2%), T6 and T28 (6.3% each), T8 and T22 (0.6% each), T13 (0.4%), T9 and B3264 were found in group A. Type T4 and T12 formed main types up to this time and T1, T3, T6 and T28 were other predominant types. The elevated isolation rates of type T3 and T28 were remarkable in this period. In group B, Ia (31.5%), III (16.8%), Ib (14.3%), II (8.0%) and V (4.2%) were observed. On 617 samples (391 group A, 226 group B) out of these strains, antibiotic susceptibility to 9 drugs were examined. No resistant strain (MIC greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml) to beta-lactam antibiotics was found in each group. Resistant strains in group A streptococci were demonstrated 24.3% to TC, 0.5% to OL. No resistant strain, however, was observed to CP or EM. In group B, resistant strains were found in 39.8% to TC, 6.6% to CP, 2.2% to EM. Strains resistant to only TC (31.0%) were most prevalent followed by TC.CP (6.2%) and TC.MLs (2.7%). Multi-resistant strain (to TC.CP.MLs) was not found.
TI  - Detection of nephritis strain-associated streptokinase by monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) N-59 and RU-1 were produced by immunisation of mice  with streptokinase secreted by Streptococcus group A, type 12, strain A374 isolated from a patient with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) and were characterised by Western blot analysis. MAb N-59 recognised antigenic determinants shared by both nephritis strain-associated streptokinase (NSA-SKase) and streptokinase of Streptococcus group C (C-SKase); MAb RU-1 reacted only with NSA-SKase. All nephritis-associated group A streptococcal strains tested reacted with MAb N-59; 87.5% of these strains reacted with MAb RU-1. MAb N-59 reacted with SKase produced by group G streptococcal strains isolated from patients with PSGN, and MAb RU-1 recognised SKase in two out of three of these strains.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of the fluoroquinolones PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391.
AB  - Three new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl quinolones--PD 117596, PD 124816, and PD 127391--were tested for in vitro antibacterial activity against 349 bacterial strains, which are primarily clinical isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in micrograms/ml required for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.03-0.06 for staphylococci (26 strains); 0.06-0.25 for Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis (80); less than or equal to 0.015 for Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (42); 0.06 for Enterobacteriaceae (97); 0.125-0.25 for Acinetobacter spp. (14); 0.5 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20); 0.125-1.0 for Bacteroides fragilis (13); and 0.25-0.5 for anaerobic cocci (11). These activities were generally superior to that of ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythomycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. The activities of the new quinolones were generally unchanged with light, 50% human serum, aerobic/anaerobic atmosphere, 5% sodium choate, cation supplementation, and 100-fold increased or decreased inoculum; as with other quinolones, potency was measurably diminished with decreasing pH (pH less than or equal to 6.0) and in 100% urine.
TI  - Inverse correlation in nutritionally variant streptococci between the production  of bacteriolytic activity and sensitivity to a Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriocinlike inhibitory substance.
AB  - Nineteen strains of nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) were tested for bacteriolytic activity and for their production of and sensitivity to streptococcal bacteriocinlike inhibitory substances (BLIS). None appeared to produce BLIS. An inverse relationship was found between the sensitivity to BLIS and the production of bacteriolytic activity against Micrococcus luteus. All but one of the 14 Streptococcus defectivus isolates were sensitive to the BLIS of S. pyogenes P5, and these isolates were nonlytic. The five S. adjacens isolates were not sensitive to any BLIS tested, and all of these isolates displayed bacteriolytic activity. Sensitivity to the BLIS of S. agalactiae P3 separated the nonlytic S. defectivus strains into two categories.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - The relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  - Fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. The accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. The results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. Conversely, the tonsil core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. Therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. Surface bacteria may not, however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. Implications for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of PD 131628, a new 1,8-naphthyridine anti-infective agent.
AB  - PD 131628 is a new aminopyrrolidine-substituted fluorocyclopropyl naphthyridine quinolone which possesses high in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of bacterial species. The MICs for greater than or equal to 90% of strains were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae; 0.5 micrograms/ml for S. agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis; 0.125 micrograms/ml for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.; 0.5 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In these in vitro comparisons with ciprofloxacin, PD 131628 is more active against gram-positive organisms, approximately equivalent against gram-negative organisms, and, like most other quinolones, relatively inactive against gram-negative anaerobes. In most instances, the in vitro potency of PD 131628 exceeded those of widely used compounds: ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, aztreonam, piperacillin, amikacin, spectinomycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of ceftibuten against multiply-resistant microorganisms from Belgium.
AB  - To study the activity of ceftibuten, we obtained multiply-resistant isolates from approximately 20 hospitals in Belgium. Against Enterobacteriaceae, all of the tested comparative compounds were more active than cefaclor, and ceftibuten and tigemonam were the most active of the agents tested. Ceftibuten MIC50s were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml for most enteric bacilli species and 85% of strains were susceptible (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). This level of activity compared favorably to that recorded for cefaclor (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml), cefetamet (less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and cefteram (less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), that is, 37%, 69%, and 59%, respectively. Ceftibuten, cefetamet, cefteram, and tigemonam were highly active against isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. None of the comparative agents were as active as cefaclor against staphylococcal isolates. Against streptococci, cefteram was the most active, and tigemonam the least active of the agents. The MIC90s of ceftibuten for strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Strains of Streptococcus agalactiae were resistant to both ceftibuten and tigemonam; cefaclor and cefteram inhibited 100% of isolates of this species. Strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently resistant to all of the compounds. Overall, ceftibuten exhibited potent activity against many multiply-resistant clinical isolates.
TI  - Application of the polymerase chain reaction to study the M protein(-like) gene family in beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  - Evaluation of homologous regions of published M protein (emm) gene sequences from group A streptococci (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) was used to design three primer pairs for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and three oligonucleotide probe sequences internal to the amplified products. One set of primers and corresponding probe should detect and lead to amplification of emm(-like) genes of virtually every type ("all M"), another ("SOR-M") should only amplify emm(-like) genes from GAS negative for serum opacity reaction (SOR) and the third ("SOR+ M") should expand only emm(-like) genes from SOR+ GAS. Using the "allM" primer pair for PCR on the genomic DNA from GAS of 29 different M types as well as from a group C and a group G streptococcal isolate, DNA fragments within the expected size range were amplified in every assay. All PCR products reacted with the "allM" probe. Related sequences were not detected in genomic DNA of an S. agalactiae and an Enterococcus faecalis isolate. Applying the "SOR-M" and "SOR+M" primers to identical assays led to mutually exclusive amplification products. The "SOR-M" and "SOR+M" probes hybridized only to their corresponding products. Exceptions to this exclusivity were the SOR- GAS of M types 3, 8, 27, 34, 42, 67, and 69, which consistently reacted only with the "SOR+M" primer/probe set. Analysis of sequence data from the amplified emm(-like) 2, 3, 18, and 19 genes revealed interesting specific features such as conserved gaps in the C-terminal sequence regions from SOR+ and the exceptional SOR- GAS strains. These data indicate the existence of a subgroup of strains among SOR- GAS and may advance our understanding of phylogenetic relationship between different serotypes of GAS.
TI  - Cefixime shows good effects on group A and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci.
AB  - There is continued interest in the development of oral beta-lactam compounds, which can be used clinically to treat various bacterial infections, particularly those caused by beta-haemolytic streptococci. Cefixime is a new orally active cephalosporin, with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, including Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cefixime is highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases. In this study the authors examined the effects of this molecule on Group A and Group B beta-haemolytic streptococci, recently isolated from clinical specimens in the authors' laboratory. MICs and the growth curves of 36 strains of Group A streptococci and the effects of sub-MICs on buccal cell adhesion were evaluated. The results show that concerning the sub-MIC cefixime effect on streptococci adherence, the treatment led to a decrease in adherence to the cells of the strains studied. Moreover cefixime showed good activity with 86.1% of the strains with MIC less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, and the growth curves demonstrated that the molecule possesses a bactericidal effect after 3 h. Concerning Group B streptococci, 70.3% of the strains showed a MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. In conclusion cefixime demonstrates good activity on beta-haemolytic streptococci, particularly those of Group A.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefpodoxime against 1834 isolates from domiciliary infections at 20 UK centres.
AB  - A total of 1834 non-copy, general practice or outpatient isolates were collected  by 20 hospital laboratories within the British Isles, and identified and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents available by oral administration at one centre. Against Enterobacteriaceae cefpodoxime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested, the MIC90s being: for Escherichia coli 1.0 mg/l, for Proteus mirabilis 1.0 mg/l, for Citrobacter spp. 2.0 mg/l, and for Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Morganella spp. and Klebsiella spp. 16-64 mg/l. Cefpodoxime also showed a certain amount of activity against staphylococci and high activity against streptococci, the MIC90s being for Staphylococcus aureus 2 mg/l, for coagulase negative staphylococci 8 mg/l, for Streptococcus pyogenes 0.015 mg/l, for Str. pneumoniae 0.06 mg/l and for Str. agalactiae 0.5 mg/l.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.

TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - A case of group B streptococcal pyomyositis.
AB  - The group B streptococcus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a variety of serious infections including bacteremias, puerperal sepsis, and neonatal meningitis. Group B streptococcal infections of muscle are rare. We report here an unusual case of group B streptococcal pyomyositis. Pyomyositis arises predominantly from infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and, occasionally, Streptococcus pyogenes. Because of the rarity of pyomyositis in temperate climates, the common lack of localizing signs or symptoms, and the frequently negative blood cultures, considerable delay often precedes the diagnosis of pyomyositis; in fact, the infection has been initially misdiagnosed as muscle hematoma, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, osteomyelitis, or neoplasm. Diagnosis may be greatly aided by radiologic techniques that can demonstrate the sites of muscle enlargement and the presence of fluid collections. The response to antibiotics is usually rapid, but resolution of the infection may require aspiration of deeply situated muscle abscesses. This report describes a diabetic patient with an unusual presentation of pyomyositis that mimicked an acute abdomen.
TI  - [The morphology of microcolonies as a criterion for recognizing bacteria in the differentiation of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus group B].
AB  - The authors studied the diagnostic importance of the morphology of microcolonies  of S. pyogenes and group B streptococci in comparison with the currently used tests for the differentiation of these two species: the bacitracin test, the hydrolysis of sodium hippurate and the CAMP test. The standard tests proved to be positive in 94-97% and microcolonies had typical morphology in 86-95.7%. The statistical indices of the diagnostic effectiveness of differential tests varied within 93.8-98.9%. The diagnostic value of the study of the morphology of colonies was characterized by the following data: the sensitivity and prognostic negative value of the study were 95% for S. pyogenes and 86-89% for group B streptococci, while its specificity and prognostic positive value were 100% due to the absence of false positive results.
TI  - Presence of chromosomal elements resembling the composite structure Tn3701 in streptococci.
AB  - Tn3701, carried by Streptococcus pyogenes A454, is the first chromosomal composite element to be described; it contains in its central region Tn3703, a transposon similar to Tn916. A comparison by DNA-DNA hybridization of Tn3701 with omega(cat-tet) and Tn3951, carried by Streptococcus pneumoniae BM6001 and by Streptococcus agalactiae B109, respectively, revealed that the two latter structures are also Tn3701-like composite elements. The DNAs of 27 other antibiotic-resistant group A, B, C, and G streptococci and of S. pneumoniae BM4200 showed sequence homologies to Tn3701 (14 strains, including BM4200), to the regions of Tn3701 outside of Tn3703 (5 strains), and to Tn916 alone (8 strains). The DNAs of five strains did not detectably hybridize with any probe. The tetM gene was identified in most chromosomal genetic elements coding for tetracycline-minocycline resistance. Since Tn3701-like elements are widely disseminated among antibiotic-resistant streptococci (47% of the 34 strains studied), we propose that Tn3701 be considered the prototype of chromosomal composite elements.

TI  - [Streptococcal disease: a current problem in public health].
AB  - The high priority and prevalence of streptococcal diseases and complications, particularly among children and young adults, is emphasized. The attention is focused on group A and B streptococci and on the need to develop the laboratory diagnosis of streptococcal diseases as the basis for the development of their epidemiology and prevention. The literature data and the author's own reports concerning streptococcal cells, their antigens, receptors, and intracellular products are reviewed. Based on this, the following major aspects are discussed: the mechanism of streptococcal adhesion, the role played by immunoglobulin Fc-receptors and anti-immunoglobulins in the genesis of post-streptococcal complications; the genetics of streptococcal cell and, in the first instance, of its pathogenicity. Streptococcus is also viewed as an object of genetic engineering and biotechnology. The required minimal approaches to the microbe and its antigen identification are analysed. Recent 12-15 years' research findings are generalized.
TI  - Streptococci from the bovine udder in dairy herds in Khartoum Province, Sudan.
AB  - Five hundred and seventy-nine milk samples were collected from dairy cows on seven farms in Khartoum North area and one farm in Omdurman and examined by bacteriological cultures for the presence of streptococci. One hundred and ninety-three (33.33%) isolates were recovered and identified on the basis of bacteriological characteristics and biochemical reactions as: S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. bovis, S. equi, S. lactis and S. uberis. Fifty-seven isolates representing the preliminary identification were tested by the latex-agglutination test to determine the serological groups. It was found that 39 strains belonged to group B, 3 strains to group C. Four strains gave a weak reaction with group D sera and were identified by biochemical tests as S. uberis. Two isolates could not be identified by the available sera. The isolation of S. uberis, S. bovis, S. equi, S. lactis, S. faecalis, S. faecium and S. pyogenes from cows in the Sudan was reported for the first time.
TI  - [Milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. Bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. The study was aimed to detect the following bacteria: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Enterobacteriaceae rods, Corynebacterium bovis, and Micrococcus sp. Milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. Milk productivity was determined on the day of bacterial isolation. Statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on the health condition of their udder. It seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.
TI  - [The in vitro effects of josamycin on various strains of bacteria].
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration of josamycin was studied by the dilution plate method on the strains Staphylococcus aureus, plasmacoagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and enterococci. The effect of josamycin was compared with that of erythromycin, penicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazol, and furantion. Of the series of 572 strains tested, josamycin was most effective in the strains Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. All the strains tested were susceptible to josamycin, including the Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to erythromycin. Of the plasmacoagulase negative staphylococci 2.6% resistant strains and 86.3% strains with decreased susceptibility were found. Of the enterococci 41.2% of the strains were resistant to josamycin. In these strains the most effective antibiotics were ampicillin and furantoin.
TI  - New receptor for human plasminogen on gram positive cocci.
AB  - 180 bacterial strains representing 17 different species of gram positive cocci were tested for the ability to interact with human plasminogen. Receptors for plasminogen could be detected on 23/24 strains of S. pyogenes, 15/15 strains of S. equisimilis, 14/16 strains of human group G streptococci and 14/14 strains of S. pneumoniae. Eight of nineteen strains representing five species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were also positive. S. equisimilis demonstrated the highest uptake with a median value of 58 per cent (20%-67%). On the other hand, all strains of S. agalactiae, the majority of S. faecalis and all S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains tested were negative. The concentration of unlabelled plasminogen causing a 50 per cent reduction of bound tracer was between 50 and 150 mM. These estimates of the dissociation constant confirmed the specific nature of the interaction. Binding of plasminogen could be blocked by addition of plasmin-aprotinin complex, suggesting that plasminogen and plasmin bind to the same receptor. Binding was also blocked by the plasminogen fragment kringle 1-3, but not by miniplasminogen, a fragment containing kringle 5 and the B-chain region. As streptokinase interacts mainly with the B-chain of plasmin it is clear that the bacterial receptor for plasminogen is not identical to streptokinase.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil granule in the pediatric field].
AB  - Cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (CFTM) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is a new oral cephem antibiotic. CFTM-PI was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to CFTM by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as CFTM. A tablet form of this drug has been released in Japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. We have determined MICs of 5 drugs (CFTM, cephalexin (CEX), cefaclor (CCL), ampicillin (ABPC), erythromycin (EM], against stock strains and MICs of 6 drugs (CFTM, CEX, CCL, ABPC, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to CFTM-PI, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. A total of 149 strains included Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (11), Streptococcus pyogenes (85), Streptococcus agalactiae (16) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and Gram-negative rods i.e. Haemophilus influenzae (11), Bordetella pertussis (11), Escherichia coli (9), Proteus mirabilis (1) and Morganella morganii (1). The granular form of CFTM-PI was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years 10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. Doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. Urinary concentrations and its urinary recovery rates of T-2525A, a main metabolite of CFTM, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4 times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). Adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. With regard to Gram-positive cocci, MICs of CFTM against 11 fresh strains of S. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus CFTM was equally effective to CEX, but less active than the other drugs tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [The role of fibronectin in the streptococcal adhesion process].
AB  - The work shows that fibronectin obtained from human plasma is capable of binding  with streptococci of different groups with almost equal effectiveness. Fibronectin bound to bacterial cells inhibits the adhesion of group A streptococci onto vaginal cells, but it produces no effect on the adhesion of group B streptococci. The binding constant of fibronectin 125I is equal to 10(6) -M-1, which indicates that the level of the specificity of interaction is not sufficiently high.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil dry syrup in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807) is a new oral cephem derivative drug in which carboxylic acid was esterified to the 4-position of CPDX (oxime type cephem antibiotic). CPDX-PR is hydrolyzed mainly with esterase in intestinal wall and CPDX exists as an active form in body fluid. While there are numerous study reports using CPDX-PR in tablet forms in Japan, the dry syrup formula for pediatric use was newly developed. The dry syrup of CPDX-PR was orally administered 20 minutes after meal to the 6 boys of ages from 8 years and 1 month to 10 years and 10 months, with doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg, respectively, for 3 cases each. Serum concentrations and urinary concentrations and recovery rate of the drug were investigated. In addition to the above, the clinical and bacteriological studies were performed in a total of 105 cases consisting of children with ages ranging from 2 months to 11 years and 8 months, upon administering an average dose of 3.4 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times per day (96 cases of 3 times and 9 cases of 4 times). The 105 cases included 13 cases of pharyngitis, 21 cases of tonsillitis, 4 cases of acute bronchitis, 6 cases of pneumonia, 1 case of pleurisy, 13 cases of scarlet fever, 41 cases of urinary tract infection, 3 cases of posthitis and 3 cases of bacillary dysentery. Drug sensitivity test was performed for the following strains: (i) Strains retained by our department; 52 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 18 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 11 strains of Bordetella pertussis, and (ii) strains isolated from cases to which CPDX-PR was administered; 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 8 strains of S. pyogenes, 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 10 strains of Escherichia coli, and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis. Drug sensitivities of the strains retained by our department were tested with the inoculum sizes of 10(8) and 10(6) cfu/ml for R-3746 (Na-salt of CPDX), cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), amoxicillin (AMPC), and methicillin (DMPPC), and those against strains separated from the cases to which CPDX-PR was administered were tested with the same inoculum sizes for R-3746, CCL, CEX, cefadroxil, ampicillin (ABPC), DMPPC and cloxacillin (MCIPC). Adverse reactions and abnormal clinical laboratory test results were also examined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Serotyping of beta hemolytic streptococci and their distribution in clinical specimens].
AB  - In the present study 300 beta hemolytic streptococci isolated from various clinical specimens have been serogrouped and their distribution in body sites have been discussed. Beta hemolytic streptococci have been recovered from 10.6% of throat cultures, 8.7% of urine cultures, 7% of other cultures. Group A streptococci have been mostly isolated from throat cultures with a percentage of 71.9 whereas the mostly isolated serogroup from urinary specimens was Group D (73.7%). Group B streptococci have been isolated in 21.1% and 22.7% ratios from urinary tract and other specimens, respectively.
TI  - Beta-haemolytic streptococci from the female genital tract: clinical correlates and outcome of treatment.
AB  - Clinical features, treatment and outcome were assessed retrospectively by means of a questionnaire in 174 patients in general practice whose vaginal swabs yielded beta-haemolytic streptococci. These were compared with 96 patients whose swabs yielded no recognized microbial pathogens. Patients with group B streptococci did not differ in any of these parameters from the control group, but those with group A streptococci were more likely to have vaginal soreness, a purulent discharge, and to respond to anti-streptococcal antibiotics. Implications for laboratory reporting are discussed.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium in neonates].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) were performed in neonates. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Plasma levels and urinary excretion of IPM and CS sodium were determined in 7 neonates with ages between 7 and 26 days (gestation periods were 37 to 41 weeks and birth weights were 2,410 to 3,890 g) upon 1 hour drip intravenous infusion of IPM/CS at 10 mg/10 mg/kg, or 20 mg/20 mg/kg. Mean plasma concentrations of IPM reached their peaks at the end of infusion with levels of 12.7 +/- 3.0 micrograms/ml for the group given 10 mg/10 mg/kg, and 19.1 +/- 4.1 micrograms/ml for 20 mg/20 mg/kg. The concentration of IPM in plasma showed a dose-response to the 10 mg/10 mg/kg and 20 mg/20 mg/kg dosages. Concentrations decreased with half-lives of 1.87 +/- 0.71 hours and 1.97 +/- 0.21 hours for the low and the high dosages, and plasma levels at 8 hours after administration were 0.3 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml and 0.8 +/- 0.3 microgram/ml, respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates in 8 hours after administration were 37.6 +/- 11.8% and 26.8 +/- 17.2% for the low and the high dosages. While, mean plasma concentrations and mean urinary recovery rates of CS were higher than those of IPM, mean plasma half-lives of CS were similar to IPM. 2. IPM/CS was administered to 11 neonatal patients (with ages between 1 and 26 days) of various bacterial infections, and clinical effectiveness, bacteriological efficacy and adverse reactions were evaluated. Clinical efficacies in cases including 7 with acute pneumonia and 1 each with suspected septicemia, intrauterine infection, acute urinary tract infection and periproctal abscess were judged excellent in 10 and good in 1 case, and the efficacy rate was 100%. Causative organisms isolated from these patients included 3 strains of Escherichia coli and 1 strain each of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae Enterococcus faecalis and Haemophilus influenzae. All the organisms were eradicated by IPM/CS, thus the bacteriological eradication rate was 100%. No adverse reactions were observed, but decreased platelet in 1 patient and increased GOT in 2 patients were found as abnormal laboratory test values. These changes, however were transient, and returned to normal after discontinuation of IPM/CS. It was concluded that the clinical results of IPM/CS are indicative of excellent efficacy, safety and usefulness of the drug in the treatment of infections in neonates.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Invasive streptococcal infections in the era before the acquired immune deficiency syndrome: a 10 years' compilation of patients with streptococcal bacteraemia in North Yorkshire.
AB  - Significant streptococcal (non-pneumococcal, non-enterococcal) bacteraemia was detected in 100 patients in two Health Districts of North Yorkshire in the decade 1978-1988. Patients with these infections accounted for 11% of the total 902 patients in the districts in whom bacteraemia was diagnosed during the period. Infection was most often seen with beta-haemolytic streptococci (52 patients) comprising Lancefield group A (Streptococcus pyogenes) (20 patients), group B (13), group C (5), group G (9), haemolytic Streptococcus milleri and non-groupable streptococci (5). The wide variety of serious infections included cellulitis, abscess, septicaemia, pneumonia, septic arthritis, necrotising fasciitis, acute endocarditis and mycotic aneurysm. Of these 52 patients, 21 (40%) died. alpha-Haemolytic streptococcal bacteraemia was diagnosed in 38 patients of whom 24 (63%) suffered from endocarditis and three (8%) died. Three of ten patients with non-haemolytic or anaerobic streptococcal bacteraemia died also. Six of the 100 patients with streptococcal bacteraemia had concomitant acute virus infections. Of the total 56 patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed in the districts during the period, streptococci were responsible in 30 (54%) of them. The predisposing factors, clinical features and outcome of the infections are described and discussed.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. The combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (CMZ) was also investigated. Obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of Bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activity of CMZ against 1 strain of Streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of Micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. Cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of B. subtilis tested. The cervical mucus enhanced the activities of CMZ against 1 strain of S. pyogenes and 3 strains of B. subtilis. The tested organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, M. luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against B. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Mechanisms of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous: correlation  of complement consumption with opsonic activity and protective efficacy.
AB  - To study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) membrane receptor (FcRlo, CR1, and CR3)-mediated phagocytosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups A and B streptococci were examined. IGIV alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. When these bacteria were preopsonized in IGIV, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. The in vitro opsonic activity of IGIV for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by the IGIV-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, P less than .05). The in vivo protective efficacy of IGIV also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, P less than .001). Antibodies to FcRlo (Leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in IGIV but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific IgM. Both CR1 and CR3 receptors on PMNLs were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.
TI  - [Bacteriological findings in samples of milk from cows studied for the causative  agent of mastitis].
AB  - Milk samples (483,413 on the whole), collected from 237,026 cows, were investigated in the State Veterinary Institute at Pardubice in the period from 1983 to 1987. In the individual years, the proportion of cows whose milk contained the mastitis-inducing bacteria ranged from 18.0 to 24.8%, the average being 21.0%. Streptococcus agalactiae was identified most frequently as the causative agent of mastitis in the examined cows (6.4%); then followed Streptococcus dysgalactiae (3.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.4%), and Streptococcus uberis (1.9%). The presence of the beta-haemolytic streptococci with group antigens C, G and L was demonstrated in the milk of 720 cows (i. e. 0.3%) and the remaining species of streptococci were identified in 1.0% of the cows. Coliform microorganisms were detected in 0.6% and Actinomyces pyogenes in 0.1% of the cows. The remaining bacterial species were isolated from the milk of 3.6% of the cows. Coaglucase-negative staphylococci dominated in this group. Over the five years of study, the occurrence of Streptococcus agalactiae in the examined stocks declined from 10.8 to 3.5% but the occurrence of other streptococci and staphylococci increased.
TI  - DNA probe for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A total of 287 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. The test was positive for all but one isolate, strain DOC-1. This autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of S. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lytA gene. We used lytA as a DNA probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. In dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the DNA of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate DOC-1. No hybridization occurred when strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus bovis were tested. The lytA gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a DNA probe for the identification of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Comparative aspects of adhesion of group A and B streptococci to human epithelium].
AB  - The international and original research data on the adhesion of group A and B streptococci are over-viewed. Based on the conducted studies, a conclusion has been drawn on the polyfactor pattern of pathogenic streptococci adhesions. The polyfactor pattern of adhesion is manifested in (a) different ranges of tissue sensitivity to streptococci adhesion, (b) a correlation between the adhesiveness and particular phenotypes (M(+)-M-; OF(+)-OF- in group A streptococci, TSA(+)-TSA- in group B streptococci), (c) different sensitivity of adhesives to proteolytic enzymes, and (d) interaction with fibronectin. M-protein was found to be involved in specific pyogenic streptococcal adhesion to the pharyngeal epithelium, which opens up new vistas for the search of approaches to the prevention of mucosal colonization. The participation of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) in group A and B streptococci adhesion in different tissues was shown The involvement of proteins in group B streptococcal adhesion was suggested by indirect evidence, which needs to be confirmed by direct isolation of an adhesive. It is suggested, that different quantitative combinations as well as structural organization of protein complexes and LTA in the streptococcus cell wall may determine the strain and species specificity of pathogenic group A and B streptococci interaction with host tissues.
TI  - [Methodologic aspects of the isolation of beta-hemolytic streptococci].
AB  - A quick test, Phadirect Strep A (Pharmacia, Sweden), for the detection of faucial streptococcus A (SA) within a few minutes was compared to bacteriologic investigation in 67 patients with rheumatic diseases and tonsillitis. The test is fairly sensitive and convenient for screening purposes, although nonspecific reactions are possible. Studies, carried out in a maternity hospital, have demonstrated the value of tests for the isolation and identification of streptococcus B (SB). Optimum nutrient media for SB isolation and identification techniques described. A coagglutination test for SB serotyping has been developed on the basis of a Soviet staphylococcal reagent, manufactured as a dry preparation, and put to clinical trial.
TI  - [Use of group A-specific polysaccharide antigen conjugated with protein carrier for detection of specific anti-polysaccharide antibodies].
AB  - Group-A specific polysaccharide antigen has been obtained by extraction of streptococcal suspension using 4N NaNO2 and glacial acetic acid, conjugated with bovine serum albumin using CNBr. Testing of the preparation with a set of rabbit anti-sera by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and passive hemagglutination reaction (PHR) revealed its antigenic specificity both in direct experiments and in N-acetyl-D-glucosamine absorption. Forty-seven sera of EIA-studied individuals and 35 sera of PHR-studied ones, all with group-specific polysaccharide antigen, were examined. Immune reactions showed the broad spectrum of antibody titres in the studied sera. Complete correlation of anti-polysaccharide antibodies detected by the two techniques was observed in the sera with high specific antibody titres. A possibility to use the obtained group-A specific polysaccharide antigen to detect anti-polysaccharide antibodies in the sera of streptococcal infection patients is discussed.
TI  - [Group-specific antigens of streptococci in the make-up of circulating immune complexes in rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis].
AB  - The level of "A" and "B" streptococcal antigens in the circulating immune complexes, structure and the level of antibodies to the group specific streptococcal polysaccharides in the patients with minimal activity and latent course rheumatism and in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis of different duration is studied. It is shown that the concentration of the "A" group streptococcal antigens in the circulating immune complexes is higher in rheumatic patients, than in healthy subjects and tonsillitis patients. The high "B" group streptococcal antigen content is found in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A high titer of antibodies to streptococcal polysaccharides of "B" group, especially in the synovial fluid was revealed. A possibility of streptococcal antigens and their antibodies' participation in the development of pathologic process is discussed. A value of obtained indexes in the diagnosis of small activity rheumatism and early stages of rheumatoid arthritis is shown.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on sultamicillin (SBTPC) fine granule were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antibacterial activities of SBTPC against clinically isolated strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Escherichia coli were compared with those of ampicillin (ABPC). SBTPC was superior to ABPC especially against beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. catarrhalis. 2. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates of sulbactam (SBT) and ABPC after administration of SBTPC fine granule at a dose level of 10 mg/kg in 2 cases were determined. Mean half-lives of SBT and ABPC in the serum following oral administration were about 1.33 and 1.61 hours respectively. Mean urinary recovery rates of SBT and ABPC in 6 hours after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg were 58.7% and 49.6% respectively. 3. SBTPC fine granule was administered to 20 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pneumonia 8 cases, bronchitis 2, pharyngitis 2, tonsillitis 4, subcutaneous abscess 1 and urinary tract infection 3). The overall clinical efficacy rate was 100% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was 75%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except 1 case of loose stool. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed. These results indicate the usefulness of SBTPC fine granule in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [A comparison of 2 methods for determining the hydrophobicity of Streptococcus groups A and B].
AB  - A simple method for the evaluation of the hydrophobic properties of streptococci, pathogenic for humans, by their adherence to polystyrene and a modified method for measuring their hydrophobic properties by their sorption on hexadecane have been developed. The results obtained in the evaluation of the hydrophobic properties of streptococci by these two methods have been compared and the complete correlation of these results in classifying the cultures as hydrophobic and hydrophilic has been shown. For the first time the differences in the hydrophobic properties of different strains of group B streptococci have been established.
TI  - [Microbiological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM), a newly developed macrolide antibiotic with a 16-membered ring, dissolves well under acidic conditions. It has been improved over other macrolides to minimize individual variations in its absorbability. We measured, using the GA-test, variations in gastric acidities of 43 children with ages between 1 to 14 years, and investigated the relationship between gastric acidities and pharmacokinetic values. Also activities (expressed in MICs) of antimicrobial agents were studied against clinically isolated 229 bacterial strains using an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Tested organisms included Streptococcus pyogenes (77 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (29), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), as Gram-positive cocci, and Haemophilus influenzae (1), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), Bordetella pertussis (12), Salmonella sp. (4) and Campylobacter jejuni (103) as Gram-negative bacilli. Against stock strains of bacteria, MICs of 10 drugs (RKM, erythromycin (EM), josamycin (JM), midecamycin (MDM), midecamycin acetate (MOM), clindamycin (CLDM), amoxicillin (AMPC), cefaclor (CCL), minocycline, ofloxacin (OFLX] were determined. Against isolates from patients who underwent treatment with RKM, MICs of only 4 drugs (RKM, EM, JM, MOM) were determined. Measurements were made on plasma and urinary concentrations of RKM and its urinary recovery rates after patients including 6 boys with ages between 5 years 1 month and 11 years 6 months were administered with RKM (dry syrup). Two groups of 6 boys were administered between meals with RKM at dose levels of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Clinical and bacteriological effects of RKM were evaluated for 175 patients including 5 cases of pharyngitis, 3 tonsillitis, 32 pneumonia, 17 mycoplasmal pneumonia, 34 atypical pneumonia, 28 streptococcal infections, 29 Campylobacter enteritis, 4 Salmonella gastroenteritis, and 23 enteritis due to unknown organisms. Five drop-out cases were excluded from the evaluations. In the evaluable cases, an average dose level used was 31.8 mg/kg/day, with a daily dose divided into 3 to 4 administrations and with an average treatment duration of 9 days. Adverse reactions of RKM and its effects on laboratory test values were investigated in these patients including the drop out cases. Obtained results of these studies are summarized below. 1. The GA-test produced pH values indicating that amounts of gastric acid were mostly either normal or high in 42 of the 43 subjects tested (97.7%), and only one low acid case (2.3%) was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Loss of split thickness skin grafts due to non-group A beta-haemolytic streptococci.
AB  - Over a 17-month period 77 patients requiring a split skin graft for a burn injury have suffered loss of previously well taken graft due to the growth of a beta-haemolytic streptococcus. Of these only 42 were streptococci of Lancefield group A (Streptococcus pyogenes); 16 were group B, 3 group C and 16 group G. Some strains of groups B, C and G produce cytopathic and spreading factors capable of destroying the new skin graft and regenerating epithelium. We suggest that the non-group A streptococci may be more pathogenic than previously recognised in this particular respect.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of a rokitamycin syrup in  pediatrics].
AB  - Rokitamycin (RKM) dry syrup was administered to a group of pediatric patients. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Of the recent isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, fewer strains were highly resistant to RKM than to josamycin (JM), midecamycin (MDM), erythromycin and lincomycin. Also, macrolides (MLs)-resistant strains proved to be susceptible to RKM. 2. Recent isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, group G Streptococci, S. pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to RKM than to midecamycin acetate and JM. Oral administrations of 10-15 mg/kg of the drug were followed by its peak concentrations of 0.07-0.77 micrograms/ml in the blood at 30 minutes in many patients, and by an undetectable level at 6 hours also in many of them. T1/2 values were 1.2-2.6 hours, and first 6-hour urinary excretion rates were 1.26-1.74%. 3. Fifty-two patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections, Campylobacter enteritis, etc. were treated with RKM at about 20-40 mg/kg daily for 4-14 days, with an overall efficacy rate of 88.5%. 4. An eradication rate of 81.4% was achieved for 43 strains of 7 species isolated from the patients. 5. No abnormal laboratory test values were observed after treatment with drug 4 approximately 14 days. A side effect, stomach discomfort, was observed in 1 patient.

TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef in comparison to other cephalosporins.
AB  - Flomoxef and cefazolin had nearly the same activity against staphylococci, which  was stronger than that of other cephalosporins. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, cefotaxime and cefazolin were more active than flomoxef, but the other cephamycins were less active than flomoxef. In comparison to the other cephalosporins, latamoxef and flomoxef had higher activity against Branhamella catarrhalis, whereas cefotaxime, latamoxef and cefotetan were more active against Haemophilus influenzae. Flomoxef was the only drug exhibiting activity against Clostridium difficile. The activity of flomoxef and latamoxef against Bacteroides fragilis was stronger than that of the other cephalosporins, but Bacteroides bivius was resistant to each of these antibiotics.

AB  
TI  - BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. The BMY-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. Species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by BMY-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus supp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, serogroup C and G streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. BMY-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. BMY-28100 was generally bactericidal, but MICs for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) CFU/ml was used. Strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, SHV, HMS) were susceptible to BMY-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. BMY-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (Types I and IV). BMY-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was destroyed by Type I cephalosporinases and Klebsiella K1 enzymes.
TI  - Beta-haemolytic group A, B, C and G streptococcal septicaemia: a clinical study.
AB  - 87 beta-haemolytic streptococcal septicaemias in adult patients during 1979-86 in a university hospital were reviewed. 25% were caused by group A streptococcus, 17% by group B, 14% by group C and 44% by group G streptococcus. 67% of the septicaemias due to group B streptococcus were nosocomial, whereas the group A, C or G septicaemias were in most cases community-acquired. Alcoholism was the most common underlying disease in group A (32%) and malignancy in group G streptococcal septicaemias (45%). The most common origin and focus of infection in group A, C and G streptococcal septicaemias was the skin. The total mortality in beta-haemolytic streptococcal septicaemias was 20%, higher in septicaemias caused by group A (32%) and group B (33%) than by group C (17%) and group G (8%) streptococci. Nevertheless, there were more patients in group G streptococcal septicaemias with severe underlying diseases than in other groups of beta-haemolytic streptococci. The present data seem to indicate that a septicaemia due to group G is a more benign disease than a septicaemia due to group A streptococcus.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. A two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. Staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of various species were tested. Teicoplanin showed rapid killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. hominis. All strains of Staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high MIC values (4-16 mg/l). The killing effect against Staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against Staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. A 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. Other staphylococci (Staph. aureus, Staph. saprophyticus) and Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. bovis and Str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. Bactericidal activity against other streptococci (Str. mutans, Str. agalactiae, Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) was less marked; against Str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the localization of lipoteichoic acid in Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The cellular locations of deacylated lipoteichoic acid (dLTA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were examined in late-exponential-phase cells of a serotype III strain of Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci [GBS]) isolated from an infant with late-onset meningitis and compared with a fresh clinical isolate of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci [GAS]). LTA and dLTA were found to be associated with the protoplast membranes of both organisms, with only dLTA found in mutanolysin cell wall digests. Both organisms released dLTA during growth, but only the GAS released substantial levels of LTA into the culture medium. However, penicillin treatment (5 micrograms/ml for 60 min) of GBS resulted in the recovery of LTA in cell wall digests as well as in the culture medium. These results suggest that under normal growth conditions, the hydrophobic region (glycolipid) of LTA remains associated with the cytoplasmic membrane of GBS and unavailable for hydrophobic interactions at the cell surface with epithelial cells. In contrast, release of LTA into the environment by the GAS allows the fatty acid moieties to interact with hydrophobic domains on the surface of epithelial cells. These results may help explain the marked differences in the specificity of binding between these two major streptococcal pathogens for human fetal and adult epithelial cells.
TI  - [The study of flomoxef in the pediatric field].
AB  - Flomoxef (FMOX; 6315-S), a new synthetic oxacephem antibiotic, was studied in the pediatric field and pharmacokinetic and clinical results obtained were summarized below. 1. The activity of FMOX against Staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical patients, including latamoxef resistant strains was very high and MIC was approximately less than or equal to 0.39 microgram/ml. This MIC value was lower than other cephem antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefamandole. The distribution of MIC's of FMOX against Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml and from 0.05 to 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. 2. Serum concentrations of FMOX after dosages of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg with 1 hour intravenous drip infusion were 21.5-27.5 micrograms/ml, 6.00-7.81 micrograms/ml, 0.37-0.59 micrograms/ml at 1, 2, 5 hours after administration, respectively, and T1/2(beta) were 0.61-0.83 hour. Serum concentrations after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg FMOX were 56.7-90.2 and 0.20-0.26 micrograms/ml at 3-10 minutes and 6 hours after administration, respectively, T1/2(beta) was 1.22 hours and urinary excretion rate was 66.7-69.8% in 6 hours. 3. FMOX was administered to 32 cases (upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and purulent infections) at 3-4 times daily for 4-13 days. In these cases the daily dosage amounted to 41-119 mg/kg. Clinical effectiveness was 97% overall including resistance cases upon other cephem antibiotic treatment. All bacterial species identified including Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated upon the treatment with FMOX. 4. Only 3 cases of soft stool, 1 case of elevated GOT and GPT, and 1 case of elevated GPT were observed, and all of these adverse reactions were normalized after the completion of treatment.
TI  - Novel complex formed between a nonproteolytic cell wall protein of group A streptococci and alpha 2-macroglobulin.
AB  - Binding of 125I-labeled alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) to streptococci belonging to serological groups A, B, C, and G was studied. Streptococci of groups A and G interacted only with native alpha 2M, and those of group C reacted only with alpha 2M-trypsin complex. Binding of alpha 2M to group A streptococci was saturable and reversible. The dissociation constant was 2.02 X 10(-7) M, and the number of binding sites was calculated to be 18,000 per streptococcus. The alpha 2M-binding protein could be solubilized by treatment of group A streptococci with a murolytic enzyme and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography. The purified protein was homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and had a molecular weight of 78,000. It possessed no proteolytic activity and interacted with native alpha 2M in Western blots (immunoblots). Interaction of purified binding protein with alpha 2M led to a change in the conformation of alpha 2M similar to that obtained by alpha 2M-protease complexes. Reversible binding of a nonproteolytic streptococcal component of alpha 2M is thus a novel feature of alpha 2M reactivity.

TI  - [Ultrastructure of the L forms of Streptococcus group B].
AB  - The submicroscopic organization of the L-forms of beta-hemolytic streptococci of  group B has been studied in the course of their cultivation. The L-forms of group B streptococci differ from those of group A streptococci by a higher growth rate. On the submicroscopic level, the activity of ATP-ase has been revealed on the internal side of the cytoplasmic membrane. Regularities in the localization of intramembranous particles sized 6-18 nm in the hydrophobic area of the membrane have been established by means of freezing-etching. With the adequate methods of fixation, the continuous three-layer structure of the cytoplasmic membrane can be determined in all elements of the L-form population.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin.
AB  - 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. Ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except Streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Ro 19-5247 was the only oral cephalosporin active against Bordetella pertussis. It was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against Haemophilus influenzae. In its activity against enterobacteria Ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. Only a few strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were resistant to Ro 19-5247 as were all strains of Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella ozaenae. Ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes. There was no difference in the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against Haemophilus influenzae Ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. The activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of Ro 19-5247. Ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.
TI  - A two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  - There are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. The hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. Two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. Bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. Of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. About 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. The most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. The most common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. Correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.
TI  - Activity of A-56268 compared with that of erythromycin and other oral agents against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A-56268 was compared with erythromycin, roxithromycin (RU 28965), and perorally administered antimicrobial agents. Its in vitro activity was similar to that of erythromycin and slightly greater than that of roxithromycin, with beta-hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae inhibited by less than 2 micrograms of A-56268 per ml (50% inhibited by 0.06 microgram/ml). Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. Pneumoniae, and S. faecalis resistant to erythromycin were resistant to A-56268, and 4 micrograms/ml inhibited 90% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates.
TI  - Rapid presumptive identification of streptococci directly from blood cultures by  serologic tests and the L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide reaction.
AB  - The value of the Strepslide kit for the rapid presumptive identification of streptococci directly from blood cultures without prior determination of hemolysis patterns was assessed and compared with that of the Streptex and Phadebact streptococcus kits. Studies involved 94 simulated and 60 clinical isolates of 83 streptococci. The Streptex and Strepslide kits had excellent sensitivity and specificity for group A, B, F, and G organisms, and the Phadebact kit had excellent sensitivity and specificity for groups B and G. Group C reactions usually occurred with all of the streptococcus kits with pneumococci and occasionally with alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Although these kits were unacceptable for group C and D organisms, enterococci which were common clinical isolates could be directly identified in blood cultures by a supplementary rapid L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide biochemical test. Direct application of the Phadebact pneumococcus kit to blood cultures was also assessed with 29 isolates of 20 organisms. The specificity was good, but the sensitivity was only 65.5%.
TI  - In vitro activity of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide, compared with that of erythromycin and clindamycin against selected gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The in vitro activity of A-56268 was determined and compared with that of erythromycin and clindamycin against a limited spectrum of 401 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. A-56268 was quite active against erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and group B streptococci and was moderately active against Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus. A-56268 was consistently bactericidal only for S. pneumoniae. The activity of A-56268 was comparable to that of erythromycin against most organisms tested.
TI  - [Drug resistance of bacterial strains isolated from sows with the clinical picture of mastitis-metritis-agalactia].
AB  - The disk method with Ericson and Bauer's solid nutrient media were employed to ascertain the drug resistance of a total of 54 strains of Escherichia coli, 25 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 11 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 7 strains of Corynebacterium pyogenes, 7 strains of Streptococcus uberis, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, and 1 strain of Streptococcus disgalactiae isolated from utero-cervical exudate and milk samples of sows with clinical symptoms of mastitis-metritis-agalactia (MMA). It was found that gentamycin only suppressed 100 per cent of the strains. So far as the other chemotherapeutic agents were concerned the organisms showed a varying extent of resistance. After determining the sensitivity of the strains to drugs two groups of pigs (from which the strains referred to were isolated) were subject to treatment. All 20 sows of the first group were treated with oxytocin only, while the 446 animals of the second group were treated with gentamycin in combination with oxytocin. It was found that effective therapy in the case of MMA was impossible with the application of preparations on the base of the hind lobe of the pituitary only. It is necessary to use chemotherapeutic means tow which the isolated organisms are susceptible.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of CI934, a new fluoroquinolone, alone and in combination with coumermycin, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Cl934, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, was studied  against 314 strains of Gram-positive bacteria representing 6 genera: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. milleri, viridans streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK, Mycobacterium fortuitum and Bacillus spp.; and compared with that of enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ampicillin, coumermycin, oxacillin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifapentine, LM 427, erythromycin, minocycline, tetracycline and clindamycin. The agar dilution method was used. Cl934 was very active in vitro, with MIC90 less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l against most species tested, except for S. faecalis and M. fortuitum. It was usually 2 to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin. Cl934 was also tested by the killing curve method, alone and in combination with coumermycin. It was rapidly bactericidal against most species tested, including S. faecalis. A synergistic interaction was observed with coumermycin against S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. milleri and S. faecalis. The only antagonistic interaction occurred against L. monocytogenes exposed to 8 X MIC of Cl934 with 2 X MIC of coumermycin.
TI  - Streptococcal diseases worldwide: present status and prospects.
AB  - Infections caused by streptococci pathogenic for man are some of the most common  bacterial diseases in temperate zones and occur very frequently in tropical and subtropical countries. The highest morbidity occurs from infections caused by group A streptococci; these infections can lead to rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. The incidence of rheumatic fever and the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease are several times higher in tropical countries than temperate countries.Recent developments in fundamental and applied research are throwing light on various aspects of the problem, e.g., the rapid (non-culture) identification of group A streptococcal infection. Analyses of the chemical structure of the M-protein molecule of group A streptococcus and of the biological properties of the epitopes of the M-protein have provided encouraging results. Furthermore, synthetic analogues of the protective immunodominant polypeptides of the M-protein have been prepared. The prospect of a streptococcal vaccine for preventing group A streptococcal diseases is thus more realistic.The control of infections caused by group B streptococci is important for the health of neonates. The identification of the chemical structure of the major group B streptococcal types may lead to development of a vaccine in the future. An alternative approach would entail the use of anti-group-B immunoglobulins, but a number of questions have to be answered before the new control measures can be introduced. The streptococci causing bacterial pneumonia, subacute bacterial endocarditis and possibly dental caries have been widely studied and promising advances have been made towards the introduction of better control of the diseases caused by these pathogens.
TI  - Effective murolytic solubilization of streptococcal-group-specific antigen.
AB  - Streptococcal-group-specific antigens were solubilized with a murolytic enzyme contained in the culture supernatant of Streptomyces globisporus. This facilitated the effective serogrouping of streptococci from humans and animals.
TI  - Opsonic activity and composition of five intramuscular gammaglobulin preparations.
AB  - The opsonic activity of five immunoglobulin preparations for intramuscular and subcutaneous substitution therapy was investigated. Various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were used. In addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments and IgG aggregates in these preparations was determined. With the exception of H. influenzae, all preparations opsonised the bacteria studied almost as well as inactivated serum. All preparations contained an appreciable amount of aggregates, but IgG fragments were not found.

TI  - [Comparative biological characteristics of the L-form of Streptococcus group A and B].
AB  - The comparative study of the biological and serological properties of the L-forms of streptococci, groups A and B, has been made. Their morphological similarity on the level of light microscopy has been demonstrated. The use of ring precipitation, gel diffusion, passive hemagglutination, aggregate hemagglutination, as well as the immunoferritin technique, has made it possible to establish the presence of specific antigens in the L-forms of streptococci, groups A and B. Serological cross reactions are negligible. The future development of a diagnosticum for the specific indication of these antigens is proposed. The fact of the presence of specific antigens in the L-forms of streptococci in comparison with the initial streptococcal strains has been confirmed.
TI  - Coaggregation between Actinomyces viscosus with Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Interbacterial coaggregation between Actinomyces viscosus indigenous to the human mouth and Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae was studied. Fifteen of twenty-six strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and thirteen of thirty-one Streptococcus agalactiae showed a coaggregation with Actinomyces viscosus strain. The results show that the coaggregation mechanism required calcium and was dependent on pH. Some coaggregations were inhibited by 0.06 M. lactose and by 1 M. NaCl.
TI  - Modulation of complement fixation and the phlogistic capacity of group A, B, and  D streptococci by human lysozyme acting on their cell walls.
AB  - Streptococci and streptococcal cell wall fragments induce arthritis in rats, with the severity and duration depending on the capacity of the cells or cell fragments to resist degradation by tissue enzymes. Their phlogogenic effects are apparently related to their ability to activate the alternate complement pathway (ACP). The in vitro activation of the ACP by lysozyme-treated cells and cell walls of group A, B, and D streptococci suggests that both rat and human lysozyme can modulate this activity, i.e., increasing it, decreasing it, or doing both in that order. The effects of the lysozymes also correlated with the degree to which they can unmask the aminosugar-reducing groups detectable in a given amount of cell wall, which suggests that partial depolymerization of the cell wall is critical for ACP activation. The effects of mutanolysin and C phage lysin on ACP activation were found to be correlated with their action on streptococcal cell walls. Neuraminidase had relatively little effect on ACP activation by most streptococcal strains tested. We conclude that the participation of tissue enzymes, including but not necessarily limited to lysozyme, is an important determinant for the clinical arthritis induced by group A, B, or D streptococci. Experimental arthritis induced in rats with whole (or disrupted) streptococci may depend both on the capacities of the cell walls to activate the ACP and on the capacities of the host tissue enzymes to modulate this activation. Great severity and long durations of the disease were determined by the capacity of the enzymes to degrade cell wall antigens to a degree sufficient to ensure efficient activation of the ACP without completely degrading the material so that it no longer activates complement. In this model, the limited resistance of group B peptidoglycan to lysozyme was a critical pathogenic factor.

TI  - Streptococcal puerperal sepsis and obstetric infections: a historical perspective.
AB  - The streptococcus, responsible for inestimable morbidity and mortality among parturient women since the 16th century, is no longer a significant cause of puerperal infection. Although the problem of the group A streptococcus in obstetrics has abated, the obstetrician is now confronted with the group B streptococcus, which is a major cause of fetal, neonatal, and maternal morbidity and mortality. Some historical insight into the infectious disease problems encountered by obstetric practitioners during the last four centuries allows comparison and contrast between the historic scourge of childbed fever and present day obstetric infections.
TI  - Safety and efficacy of once daily ceftriaxone for the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Fifty-seven patients with bacterial meningitis were treated with once daily ceftriaxone. After an initial loading dose of 100 mg/kg, the patients received 80 mg/kg as a single daily dose. Etiologic agents included: Haemophilus influenzae type b, 37 (11 beta-lactamase-positive); Neisseria meningitidis, 11; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1; Haemophilus influenzae type f, 1; and Group B Streptococcus, 1. All patients showed clinical improvement and all were bacteriologically cured. Satisfactory cerebrospinal fluid bactericidal activity and drug concentrations were seen 24 hours after a dose even in those patients in whom repeat spinal taps were carried out following the last dose of therapy. The drug was well-tolerated and the major adverse effect seen was diarrhea in 20.4% of the patients. The diarrhea was mild and self-limited and did not necessitate discontinuation of the drug although it was frequently associated with alterations in the stool microbiologic flora. Based on this preliminary experience, ceftriaxone, when given in a single daily dose, appears safe and effective in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in nonneonatal infants and children.
TI  - Coumermycin: in vitro activity against 251 clinical isolates of bacteria compared with the activities of eight other antibacterial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of coumermycin has been compared with those of ampicillin,  clindamycin, cloxacillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, netilmicin, penicillin G and vancomycin. A total of 251 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci were examined. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by an agar dilution method. Clindamycin, coumermycin and erythromycin were the most active drugs against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis on a weight-for-weight basis. All the staphylococcal isolates were inhibited by coumermycin at a concentration of 0.12 mg/l or less. Netilmicin seemed to be somewhat more active against S. epidermidis than against S. aureus. The MICs of vancomycin for the staphylococcal isolates were clustered around 1 mg/l. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were highly susceptible to penicillin G and erythromycin; most isolates were inhibited by 0.03 mg/l or less of either drug. Coumermycin showed poor activity against S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and enterococci. Most of the S. pneumoniae isolates had also high MICs, although a wide range of sensitivities was found.
TI  - Immunoelectrophoretic analysis of Streptococcus agalactiae serotype Ia antigens.
AB  - Rabbit antibodies to heat-killed whole cells of Streptococcus agalactiae serotype Ia were used to establish an antigen map using Triton X-100 sonicates of homologous cells and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. A total of 11 antigens were identified but the density of immunoprecipitates was varied and only seven could be reliably detected, one of which dominated the immunoprecipitate pattern by its intensity. The antigens were partially characterized by immunological, chemical and cell-location methods. Five of the antigens contained carbohydrate and two of those were sensitive to trypsin and probably represent cell-wall compounds. Of the three most prominent antigens, one was surface located and represented the type and shared type antigens (Iabc), one was a cell-wall carbohydrate and very sensitive to periodate, and one was a protein/carbohydrate complex which was heat-labile and trypsin sensitive. Group B epitopes were detected in three immunoprecipitates. Cross-reactions between type Ia and other serotypes and streptococci were recorded.
TI  - Specific binding sites for monomeric and aggregated beta 2-microglobulin on surface of groups A, B, C, and G streptococci.
AB  - Human beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) was isolated from urine samples of patients with tubular dysfunctions and aggregated with glutaraldehyde. Four aggregates with molecular weights of 800,000, 480,000, 260,000, and 60,000 were separated by filtration on Sephacryl S-300. The aggregates and monomeric beta 2-m (11,800 MW) were subsequently labeled with 125I and tested for binding to streptococci. Group A streptococci bound only aggregated beta 2-m with a mean binding of 44.5%. Most of the group G streptococci, on the other hand, bound only monomeric beta 2-m with a mean binding of 58%. Among group B streptococci the serotypes with protein antigens interacted mainly with monomeric beta 2-m and those without protein antigens preferentially with aggregated beta 2-m. Nontypable group B streptococcal serotypes did not bind monomeric or aggregated beta 2-m. Of the streptococci belonging to group C, S. equisimilis reacted with monomeric beta 2-m and S. dysgalactiae with aggregated beta 2-m. S. equi did not interact with monomeric beta 2-m or aggregated beta 2-m. Bindings of monomeric beta 2-m and aggregated beta 2-m were saturable and could be inhibited by the respective unlabeled forms of beta 2-m. Fibrinogen, fibronectin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, or immunoglobulin G did not inhibit the binding of either form of beta 2-m. The binding sites for monomeric beta 2-m were more susceptible to trypsin than those for aggregated beta 2-m. Treatment of streptococci with pronase destroyed their binding activities for monomeric and aggregated beta 2-m. Both monomeric beta 2-m and aggregated beta 2-m binding sites were sensitive to heat. The Scatchard plots of monomeric beta 2-m and aggregated beta 2-m were linear with Kd of 1.29 X 10(-9) M and 1.9 X 10(-9) M respectively. The number of binding sites per bacterium were estimated to be 81,000 for monomeric beta 2-m and 1,210 for aggregated beta 2-m.
TI  - Microbial pathogens from goat mastitis and phage-typing of Staphylococcus aureus  isolates.
AB  - Examination of milk from goats yielded 41 strains from 40 clinically affected halves; 15 were Staphylococcus aureus, 6 Staph. epidermis, 1 Streptococcus agalactiae, 2 Strept. dysgalactiae, 5 Strept. uberis, 2 Corynebacterium pyogenes, 3 Escherichia coli, 3 Pasteurella spp. and 4 Mycoplasma spp. One half had dual infection of Staph. aureus and Strept. dysgalactiae. Twenty two of the 297 milk samples from apparently normal halves also harboured pathogens comprising of 9 Staph. aureus, 1 Strept. agalactiae, 2 E. coli, 2 Pasteurella spp., 2 Candida albicans and 6 Mycoplasma spp. Most of the bacterial isolates were sensitive to many broad spectrum antibiotics. Twenty of the 24 Staph. aureus isolates were phase typable by a set of 23 human Staphylococcal International Phages suggesting the utility of these phages for the typing of goat strains. The isolates were grouped into 15 phage-types, many of which have been reported from human infections in Iraq. This indicates the possibility of association of human strains of Staph. aureus in caprine mastitis. No definite correlation could be noted between antibiogram and phage types of Staph. aureus strains.

TI  - Blocking of antibody complement-dependent effector functions by streptococcal IgG Fc-receptor and staphylococcal protein A.
AB  - Using haemolysis in gel, two bacterial IgG-binding substances, an Fc-receptor isolated from group A streptococci type M15, and protein A from Staphylococcus aureus, were shown to inhibit complement-mediated lysis of sheep erythrocytes sensitized with rabbit IgG. When the crude alkaline extracts of ten types of group A streptococci were tested to see whether streptococcal components other than Fc-binding material might affect lysis, the degree of inhibition was found to be correlated with Fc-binding activity. In no case was the lysis of IgM-coated cells inhibited. Opsonophagocytosis experiments showed that both purified streptococcal Fc-receptor and protein A impaired antibody complement-dependent killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes of each of two strains of group B streptococci (lacking IgG Fc-receptors). Furthermore, the impairment was ascribable to interference with the fixation of complement to the antibodies, as demonstrated in pre-opsonization experiments with one of the strains. Our results suggest that blocking of the binding of complement to IgG is an important virulence mechanism in Fc-receptor-bearing streptococci and staphylococci.
TI  - Comparative clinical evaluation of ceftizoxime with clindamycin and gentamicin and cefoxitin in the treatment of postcesarean endomyometritis.
AB  - New third generation cephalosporins have been recommended as single agent antibiotic therapy in the treatment of postoperative infections. This study compares the new third generation cephalosporin ceftizoxime with cefoxitin, clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of postcesarean section endomyometritis. The results indicate that the clindamycin and gentamicin regimen is more efficacious in the treatment of severe infection after cesarean section than either ceftizoxime or cefoxitin regimens. Therefore, the results of this study suggest caution in substituting single drug antibiotic therapy with cefoxitin or the third generation cephalosporins for the standard clindamycin and gentamicin regimen in the treatment of postcesarean section endomyometritis until more clinical data are available.
TI  - The aetiology of purulent meningitis in highland children: a bacteriological study.
AB  - Of 155 highlands children with purulent culture-positive meningitis studied from  March 1980 to September 1984, 84% were aged twelve months or less and 92% were infected with either Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae or both organisms. Other pathogens were Neisseria meningitidis (8 isolations), Streptococcus pyogenes (2 isolations) and Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella species (1 of each). Among H. influenzae isolates, serotype b strains predominated (83%) and most (96%) belonged to biotype I or II. Infections due to non-b haemophili included serotype a (9 strains), serotype f (1 strain) and non-serotypable variants (3 strains). Of 67 S. pneumoniae strains 22% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.1-1.0 micrograms/ml. The commonest serotypes were types 5 (11 isolates), type 7 (9 isolates) and types 2, 6 and 46 (6 of each). No resistance to chloramphenicol was detected in either H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae and only one of 56 strains of H. influenzae was insensitive to betalactam antibiotics. The known case fatality rate in this study was 37%. More children with pneumococcal infection died (46%) than those with haemophilus infection (30%), though the difference was not statistically significant; 79% of all deaths occurred in children aged less than twelve months. There is an urgent need for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae vaccines that are effective in young children.
TI  - The throat carrier rate of group A and other beta hemolytic streptococci among patients in general practice.
AB  - In a one-year multicenter study in general practice the rate of asymptomatic throat carriage of group A beta hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) was investigated. 2,626 patients, none of whom had had sore throat or any other streptococcal illness during the preceding three months, were evaluated. The GABHS carrier rate was 2.2% with no sex or season dependent variation, and it was 10.9% in patients less than or equal to 14 years of age, 2.3% in patients between 15 and 44 years old, and 0.6% in patients greater than or equal to 45 years old. An additional 7.2% of the patients carried beta hemolytic streptococci of groups B, C, or G. For groups C and G the influence of age on carrier rates was similar to that found for GABHS. Tetracycline resistance was found in 21% of the group A strains, in 61% of the group B strains, and in 28% of the group C and group G strains.

TI  - The detection of streptococcal antigens using monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Recent advances in hybridoma technology have allowed the development of homogeneous immunologic reagents of defined specificity, activity, and reproducibility. During the last few years, the number of monoclonal antibodies directed against bacteria has increased exponentially, and research investigations have focused on the use of monoclonal antibodies for the diagnosis and therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibody technology offers a rapid, specific diagnosis of bacterial infection, long before culture results are available. We have described the use of monoclonal antibodies for the detection of group B streptococcal (GBS) infections in mothers and infants at risk to develop invasive GBS disease. Specifically, we have used the anti-GBS monoclonal antibodies to detect GBS colonization, serotype bacterial isolates in the laboratory, and identify GBS antigens in body fluid specimens. We have also discussed the use of anti-GBS monoclonal antibodies to confer protection against fatal infection in mice. Monoclonal antibodies against group A streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae have also been developed with the potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious and often life-threatening infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. With further refinements in monoclonal antibody technology in the future, streptococcal hybridomas may replace standard culture techniques for bacterial identification in the microbiology laboratory.

TI  - Molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B  (MLS) in streptococci.
AB  - Resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. Genes coding for MLS resistance are located on plasmids and one MLS resistance transposon has been described. MLS resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. Plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (Mdal) that code either for MLS or for both MLS and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci of groups A, B, C, D (Streptococcus faecalis) and G. These plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). One smaller non-conjugative MLS resistance plasmid has been isolated from Str. sanguis (4.5 Mdal). In group D (Str. faecalis, Str. faecium) streptococci, MLS resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). These multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. The MLS resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of Str. faecalis, are located on a transposon of 3.3 Mdal, Tn917. Hybridization studies, with MLS determinants as probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne MLS resistance sequences. Elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including MLS) in streptococci of groups A, B, C, D (Str. bovis), F, G, Str. pneumoniae, Str. mitis, Str. sanguis and Str. milleri. Strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid DNA. In some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. Such elements, from Str. pyogenes and Str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.
TI  - Effect of atmosphere of incubation on the isolation of group A streptococci from  throat cultures.
AB  - The optimal atmosphere of incubation for the isolation of group A beta-hemolytic  streptococci from throat cultures has been the subject of considerable debate. To resolve this issue, we examined 5992 consecutive throat cultures performed at a private pediatric office in children with acute upper respiratory tract infections. All throat cultures were streaked onto duplicate blood agar plates, one of which was then incubated anaerobically and the other aerobically. beta-Hemolytic streptococci were isolated in cultures from 1885 (31.5%) of the patients; 1479 (24.7%) were identified as group A, and 406 (6.8%) were identified as non-group A. Group A streptococci were recovered significantly more often from the plates incubated anaerobically than from those incubated aerobically (1467 vs. 1054; anaerobic only, 425; aerobic only, 12; P less than 0.01). Non-group A streptococci were also recovered significantly more often from the plates incubated anaerobically than from the plates incubated aerobically (397 vs. 170; anaerobic only, 236; aerobic only, 9;P less than 0.01). Anaerobic incubation maximizes the yield of the throat culture. The additional cost and effort of anaerobic incubation are small, and would appear to be justified by the increased isolation rate of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. The significance of the increased isolation rate of non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococci with anaerobic incubation needs to be investigated further.

AB  - The comparative study of different protein bases has shown that the combined base containing animal blood hydrolysate (amino peptide) and acidic casein hydrolysate, moderately cleaved, in the proportion 1:1 is a good source of nitrogen and ensures the intensive growth of streptococci. As determined by the study of the physiological parameters and growth of streptococci, the presence of fodder yeast extract, glutamine, glucose and phosphates in media containing blood hydrolysate and casein hydrolysate has been found to render a stimulating effect on the growth and multiplication of these organisms. The data thus obtained have been used as the basis for developing the formula of a dried culture medium, capable of ensuring the growth of streptococci without blood or serum added and not inferior in its quality to Todd-Hewitt Broth manufactured by Oxoid Ltd. (Great Britain) and Difco Laboratories (USA). The physico-chemical and physiological characteristics of the proposed medium have been determined. The use of the new dried culture medium in medical practice will make it possible to improve the microbiological diagnosis of streptococcal infections.
TI  - Neuraminidase production by streptococci from patients with glomerulonephritis.
AB  - Autoantigenic events in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) may result from neuraminidase-induced alterations in immunoglobulin levels. Whether streptococci from patients with APSGN produced neuraminidase and, if so, what substrates could be used for screening purposes and what were of potential clinical relevance were determined. Group A streptococci cultured from 20 patients with APSGN and four patients with acute rheumatic fever and group B, C, D, and G streptococci cultured from other individuals were reacted with the substrates to determine neuraminidase activity by the thiobarbituric acid assay. Neuraminidase production was detected in 16 of 20 streptococci from patients with APSGN. Partial purification by Sephadex G-150 chromatography gave two peaks, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave two bands with neuraminidase activity. Bovine mucin was the most useful substrate to detect neuraminidase production by nephritogenic streptococci, and with respect to human substrates, IgM was the most sensitive and renal basement membrane the least sensitive to enzyme action.
TI  - [Microbiology of streptococcal infections].
AB  - Since the discovery of streptococci by the surgeon of Vienna, Theodor Billroth, more than 100 years ago, they have proved to be a bacterial group of great medical and epidemiological importance. The classification in growth-characteristics on blood culture mediums (alpha-, beta- and gamma-hemolysis) has been detached by the evidence of group specific cell wall antigens. The antigene extraction described by Lancefield can distinguish at least 21 serogroups (A-T). They have also taken over the historical names (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae etc.). In addition to group relationship the antigen structure of the streptococci cell wall (carbohydrates, peptidoglycanes, M-T-R-proteins and others) is responsible for antigenetic and pathogenetic conditions. Some species of streptococci do also excrete exotoxines (streptolysin, hyaluronidase, bacteriocines, erythrogenic toxins) with antigenetic and pathogenetic significance. Infections with streptococci of the serogroup A, B, D and H are numerously and medically significant. There is a great interest in infections due to A streptococci (pharygitis, impetigo, erysipel, scarlatin fever). The known non-purulent diseases following A streptococci infections (acute rheumatoid fever, acute glomerulonephritis) are streptococcal specific reactions for the individual. Some antigens of the cell wall and also some exotoxines react in human beings as autoantigenes. Human beings are the most important reservoir for streptococci. Nearly 20% of a population have A streptococci in their upper respiratory tract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Fibrinogen binding inhibits the fixation of the third component of human complement on surface of groups A, B, C, and G streptococci.
AB  - Effects of fibrinogen binding to M protein-positive and -negative streptococci on fixation of the third component of human complement (C3) were determined. In all test cultures of serological groups A, B, C, and G fixation of C3 was observed in normal human serum as revealed by quantitative fluorescent immunoassay. Fibrinogen binding inhibited the fixation of C3 on streptococci. The degree of inhibition was proportional to the extent of fibrinogen binding. Thus, inhibition of C3 fixation was most pronounced in strongly fibrinogen-positive streptococci of groups A, C, and G and not demonstrable in fibrinogen-negative cultures of groups C and G. Trypsinization of the streptococci destroyed their capacity to bind fibrinogen and consequently the inhibitory effects on C3 fixation. The carboxymethylated alpha and beta chains of fibrinogen moderately inhibited C3 fixation whereas gamma chain had no influence. These studies may indicate that fibrinogen binding structures other than M protein could also be involved in streptococcal pathogenicity.

TI  - [Distribution of beta-hemolytic Streptococcus groups according to clinical sources and age group].
AB  - Distribution of beta haemolytic streptococcus groups was investigated according to their clinical sources and patients' age groups. The major portion of the isolates from the respiratory tract specimens and pus was group A, and from the urine samples and vagina swabs was groups B and G. In the pediatric age group, percentages of groups A and C were found to be higher than those of the adolescents while the rates of groups B, D and G were elevated in the adolescents. These colonization sites and the age group distribution differences between Streptococcus groups have clinical and epidemiological importance.
TI  - Human serum amyloid P component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. Interactions with various bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have Ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (MO beta DG) [Hind, Collins, Renn, Cook, Caspi, Baltz & Pepys (1984) J. Exp. Med. 159, 1058-1069]. SAP was found to bind in vitro to Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. SAP also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group A Streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on Xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. No SAP bound to Escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. Binding of SAP to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free MO beta DG. SAP, a human plasma protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.
TI  - Changing pattern of neonatal streptococcal septicemia.
AB  - In recent years viridans streptococcus has emerged as a new and significant cause of neonatal septicemia. This article reports our experience over a 6-year period with respect to the prevalence and clinical presentation of viridans streptococcal vis-a-vis Group B streptococcal septicemia in neonates. Viridans streptococcus was the organism most frequently isolated taking into account all positive blood cultures for streptococci in newborns. Although some similarities were observed between the two groups, viridans streptococcal septicemia was associated with a later onset of symptoms and with a lower incidence of respiratory distress and leukopenia. Clinical findings suggest that viridans streptococcus is a less virulent organism than is Group B streptococcus. The viridans streptococcus should be considered a pathogen in the sick neonate.
TI  - [Specificity against group A, C, and G streptococci of the reverse CAMP test for  identifying Clostridium perfringens].
AB  - We studied "reverse CAMP" test specificity for the identification of Clostridium  perfringens, and the probable existence of cross-reactions with groups A, C and G streptococci. Ninety eight Clostridium strains were tested with ten S. agalactiae, ten S. pyogenes, two group C streptococci and one group G. All the strains of S. agalactiae yielded a positive "reverse CAMP" reaction when it was performed with C. perfringens strains. Cross-reactions were not detected when C. perfringens were tested with groups A, C or G streptococci. The "reverse CAMP" test proved to be specific for all the C. perfringens strains used.
TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - Comparative study of streptococcal DNase by rapid and quantitative assay systems.
AB  - Clinical isolates of group A, B, and G streptococci were compared in regard to their extracellular deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activities by the modified assay system for DNase using DNA-methyl green complex as a substrate. DNase activity in a culture supernatant of each strain was measured as a percent decrease in the substrate-specific absorbance at 640 nm. After 1 hr incubation, DNase activities in all the strains of group A streptococci were found to be markedly higher than those of any strain in the other groups, although the DNase activities in groups B and G were considerably heterogeneous. These findings were also seen when commercially available DNA-dye complex reagent for the determination of anti-DNase B antibody titer was used as a substrate in the assay system. Our results suggest that this newly established assay system could be applicable for the rapid measurement of DNase activity to distinguish group A streptococci from the other groups.
TI  - A new approach for presumptive identification of clinically important streptococci.
AB  - Several tests, bacitracin, CAMP, pyroglutamic acid-B-naphthylamide test (PYR test), bile aesculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance and pigment production tests were evaluated for their reliability and speed in presumptive identification of streptococci. Bacitracin correctly identified all of the group A streptococci but 5% of other beta haemolytic streptococci were misidentified as group A. The PYR reaction was just as sensitive but more specific for group A streptococci and the results were available within 2-3 h. The PYR reaction also effectively differentiated between enterococcal and non-enterococcal group D streptococci. Both the salt tolerance test and the PYR reaction misidentified bile aesculin positive non-group D streptococci as non-enterococcal group D streptococci. Pigment production by group B streptococci was more reliable than the CAMP test for identifying group B streptococci. The combination of PYR, bile aesculin and pigment production allowed rapid differentiation of several medically important groups of streptococci.
TI  - Exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
AB  - The practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) for the selective isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and group D enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of SXT at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. For group D enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to the thymidine concentration. In contrast, the four viridans species studied (Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis II) and Streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. For selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.

TI  - Comparison of latex agglutination and immunofluorescence for direct Lancefield grouping of streptococci from blood cultures.
AB  - Simulated positive blood cultures with 84 known stock strains of streptococci were used to comparatively evaluate the direct identification of these organisms by fluorescein-tagged antibody staining (immunofluorescence [IF]) and latex agglutination (LA). IF was not evaluated for Lancefield group D strains (a total of 81 strains tested) and had 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity. IF was least sensitive for the identification of Lancefield group F, in which three of seven strains showed no fluorescence with the group F reagent. Since LA was more convenient and revealed comparable sensitivities and specificities on 84 simulated cultures, we tested this procedure using an additional 29 fresh positive clinical blood cultures, for a total of 113 cultures tested by this technique. Of 11 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 9 reacted with the LA group C reagent, a problem not observed with IF. However, all these strains were identified by a rapid modified bile solubility test. Of the 12 Streptococcus faecalis strains, 4 were falsely negative with the group D reagent, but all were correctly identified by a rapid litmus milk reduction test. Of 12 group A strains, 1 was not detected. Of all 113 strains tested by LA, eliminating S. faecalis and S. pneumoniae, the sensitivity and specificity were 97 and 98%, respectively. LA was simple and reliable in the rapid identification of streptococci from blood cultures and appeared to be preferable to IF. When LA is used, the group D reagent should not be used, and all samples reacting with the group C reagent should be tested by a modified rapid bile solubility test to exclude S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification Card.
AB  - Because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive Identification (AMS-GPI) Card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the AMS-GPI Card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. We compared direct identification by the AMS-GPI Card with the final AMS-GPI Card identification and with our standard identification methods. We evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. The isolates included Streptococcus pneumoniae (17), Streptococcus pyogenes (13), group D enterococci (12), Streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), Staphylococcus aureus (15), and Listeria monocytogenes (1). The AMS-GPI Card identified all of the group D enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae isolates. L. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. However, the AMS-GPI Card identified only 12 of 17 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 Staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. We therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the AMS-GPI Card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.
TI  - Identification of streptococci in a medical laboratory.
AB  - A total of 965 cultures of streptococci received at a reference unit for identification were examined with API-20 Strep kits and also by established methods. The API method, although it needed to be supplemented with additional tests, largely overcame the difficulty that pyogenic streptococci are usually identified by their serological reactions and that biochemical tests are used for the identification of the other streptococci. Representatives of at least 24 established or possible species were identified.
TI  - Hyaluronidase production by groups A, B, C, and G streptococci: a statistical analysis.
AB  - Production of hyaluronidase by 147 strains of beta hemolytic streptococci was studied employing a sensitive dye-binding assay and levels of enzyme activity were evaluated statistically. The analysis of variance showed that group A strains isolated in Rio de Janeiro produced significantly smaller amounts of enzyme than group A strains from a Minneapolis (USA) collection or than groups B and G brazilian isolates. The t test revealed that M not typable nose/throat group A strains produced more hyaluronidase than skin isolates. The analysis of variance did not show a significant difference in the enzyme production between M typable and not typable brazilian strains of group A streptococci. High enzyme--producing strains were not restricted to a few serotypes of group B streptococci.

TI  - Interbacterial adherence between Actinomyces viscosus and strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Interbacterial adherence was sought between strains of Actinomyces viscosus indigenous to the human mouth and strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Six of nine strains of S. pyogenes, three of five strains of S. agalactiae, and two of four strains of P. aeruginosa were found to coaggregate with each of five strains of A. viscosus tested. Some coaggregation reactions were inhibited by 0.05 M lactose and were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive Actinomyces components. Such reactions appear to involve the galactosyl-binding adhesin previously described in type 2 fimbriae on A. viscosus. Other coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the pathogen. That such pathogen strains possessed an adhesin(s) was further suggested by the observation that they agglutinated human erythrocytes. The ability of coaggregation-positive and -negative strains of S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae to adhere to Actinomyces-coated agarose beads was also studied. Coaggregation-positive streptococcal strains attached in higher numbers to the Actinomyces-coated beads than did strains which were coaggregation negative. Lactose (0.05 M) inhibited the attachment of those streptococcal strains which coaggregated with A. viscosus in a lactose-sensitive manner. The adherence of those streptococcal strains whose coaggregation appeared to depend upon the galactosyl-binding adhesin of A. viscosus was also reduced by components of human saliva. Crude sonic extracts of coaggregation-positive streptococci or of P. aeruginosa were also effective in aggregating Actinomyces cells. The effect of lactose and of salivary components on this extract-induced aggregation of Actinomyces cells generally paralleled that observed in other assays. The apparent prevalence and diversity of adherent reactions between the pathogens studied and indigenous strains of A. viscosus suggest that some may affect host susceptibility to these infectious agents.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the improved streptex method for grouping streptococci.
AB  - The improved Streptex method for serogrouping streptococci incorporates a new extraction enzyme and a simplified procedure requiring no centrifugation. A total of 114 clinical isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci were serogrouped from primary plates, isolation plates, and Todd-Hewitt broth cultures using this system. Results were compared to those of the heat extraction Lancefield precipitin method. An additional 33 stock culture isolates of related streptococcal species and 5 strains of Listeria were serogrouped to assess the specificity of the test. Agreement between the two methods was 82.5% with primary plates and 96.5% with both isolation plates and broth cultures. Four isolates from three different serogroups were nongroupable by the Lancefield method, but did agglutinate in specific Streptex antisera; therefore, the enzyme extraction procedure appeared more sensitive than the heat extraction method. Streptex accurately grouped five isolates of gamma-hemolytic group B streptococci, but failed to detect antigen in 33% of the group D streptococcal extracts tested. In addition, cross-reactions were observed with strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Streptex produced fewer ambiguous results and required fewer repeat tests. When used with isolation plates or broth cultures, Streptex is both sensitive and specific for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, C, F, and G.
TI  - Correlation between opsonic activity for various microorganisms and composition of gammaglobulin preparations for intravenous use.
AB  - In this study 12 commercial immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous administration were investigated with respect to their opsonic activity for various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and group B streptococci, and in addition, the concentration of unsplit IgG molecules, IgG fragments, and IgG aggregates (dimers) was determined. The results show that four preparations that had been treated with enzyme or by reduction and alkylation had hardly any opsonic activity; the other preparations were as effective as inactivated serum. A statistical analysis showed an excellent correlation between the concentration of intact IgG molecules in a preparation and the opsonic activity for the various bacteria; a negative correlation between the concentration of IgG fragments and the opsonic activity was found. The combination of the two techniques used in this study provides a basis for recommendations on the choice of gammaglobulin preparations for clinical use.
TI  - Teichoic acids of Streptococcus agalactiae: chemistry, cytotoxicity, and effect on bacterial adherence to human cells in tissue culture.
AB  - The ratio of teichoic acid to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) in a strain of Streptococcus agalactiae type III was found to be 8:1, with the total amount of LTA being 0.1% of the dry weight of the organism. Purified teichoic acid contained D-alanine and possibly a small amount of D-glucose and was approximately 22 glycerol phosphate units in length. The linkage between each of these units was 1-3. In addition, LTA contained a complex lipid, more glucose, and an unusually high content of a short-chain fatty acid, tridecanoic acid. This LTA was cytotoxic for a variety of human cell monolayers in tissue culture, including one derived from the human central nervous system. Established human cells were more sensitive than primary cell monolayers to this LTA, with as little as 12.5 micrograms of LTA per ml being cytotoxic for HeLa cells. Teichoic acid (250 micrograms/ml) was nontoxic under identical conditions. These cytotoxicity results suggest an LTA involvement in group B streptococcal pathogenesis. Also, the first model system for the study of group B streptococcal adherence to primary human embryonic amnion cells in tissue culture is detailed. This system was used to quantitate pronounced differences in tissue tropism between S. agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes and showed enhanced binding by this group A coccus over that of S. agalactiae for amnion cell monolayers. The adherence of both streptococcal species to only a portion (40%) of these amnion cells suggested that host cell receptor expression may vary for primary cells in vitro. Finally, this strain of S. agalactiae was shown to adhere to amnion cells by a non-LTA-mediated mechanism. The possibility of an LTA-mediated versus a protein-mediated adherence mechanism for host cells that is related to the virulence of S. agalactiae is discussed.
TI  - [Conjugational plasmid transfer from A, B and H streptococci to N streptococci].
AB  - Plasmid-mediated resistance to erythromycin and chloramphenicol was successfully  transferred from group A, B and H streptococci to group N streptococci by a process akin to conjugation. The results showed that plasmids from streptococcal groups other than N were able to replicate in lactic streptococci as well. The transfer experiments were carried out by using a membrane filter mating technique. Four of the five plasmids used (pSM15346, pSM10419, pIP501, and pEL1) were transferred at frequencies ranging from 10(-1) to 10(-8) transconjugants per donor colony-forming unit. The highest transfer frequencies were obtained when S. pyogenes strain 15346 (pSM15346) served as the donor strain. The identy of transconjugants was verified by testing for the presence of unselected markers of the recipient strains, and both transduction and transformation were ruled out as the mechanisms of transfer.
TI  - Polysaccharide storage in different streptococci.
AB  - Calf serum, pooled human plasma, polyvinylpyrollidones (PVP) and polyethylene glycols (PEG) were required as medium components by many cultures of group A.S. pyogenes for intracellular polysaccharide accumulation. These supplements produced a stabilizing effect, probably at the cell surface, and were not associated with nutrition during intracellular iodophilic polysaccharide (IPS) storage. Medium stabilization and the presence of maltose or maltose yielding polysaccharides was found to be a property unique to the group A streptococci. Cariogenic streptococci and Streptococcus agalactive did not require medium stabilization for IPS storage although addition of PVP or PEG was stimulatory. Different degrees of IPS storage in group A.S. pyogenes was found to be strain related and probably dependent on the size and degree of branching of the storage polymer.

AB  - The virulence of beta-hemolytic and non-hemolytic strains of Streptococcus mutans was studied in neonatal mice by LD50 determinations after intracerebral injection of the bacteria. Although the differences in LD50 values are small the results may indicate that beta-hemolytic S. mutans strains (mean LD50 of 6.3 X 10(7) c.f.u.) were more virulent than non-hemolytic S. mutans strains (mean LD50 of 47.7 X 10(7) c.f.u.). The LD50 values of other viridans streptococci varied between 4.8 and 10(7) c.f.u. Strains of S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were highly virulent in this animal model with LD50 values lower than 10(5) c.f.u.
TI  - Identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  - Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 5 of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). PBPs with similar properties are carried by strains of Streptococcus durans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups A, B, C, and G streptococci or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The strains carrying the slow-reacting PBP demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. Spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from S. faecium ATCC 9790. They all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting PBP produced. Mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of S. durans, S. faecalis, and S. faecium. All of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting PBP than that carried by the parent. Finally, it was found that resistant S. faecium ATCC 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all PBPs except PBP 5. Cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting PBP by 90%. This penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.
TI  - [Stimulation of human and bovine lymphocytes by various Streptococcus species].
AB  - Concerning the question of species specifity of lymphokines in the presented examination the effect of the leukocyte migration inhibition factor (LIF) secreted by human and bovine lymphocytes was tested using PMN leukocytes of man and different animal species as indicator cells. The method was the so called indirect leukocyte migration inhibition test according to Clausen. As antigens for stimulating the lymphocytes cell wall preparations of group A- and B-Streptococci and as a mitogen Concanavalin A was used. From the results the following facts can be stated: --Human LIF has no inhibiting effect on the migration of leukocytes from cattle, sheep and pigs--independent of the way of stimulation by specific antigens or by the mitogen. --A corresponding factor to human LIF can be demonstrated from bovine lymphocytes which, however, inhibits only the migration of bovine indicator cells. This phenomenon is also independent of the kind of stimulation. --Migration inhibiting substances from bovine lymphocytes are only produced after stimulation with group A- and B-streptococci cell walls if the donor animals have been sensitized with these antigens. --The interaction between LIF and indicator leukocytes obviously is dependent on host specifity and not on a peculiar relation of macro- and microorganisms.
TI  - Characterization of binding of human alpha 2-macroglobulin to group G streptococci.
AB  - An interaction was observed between human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) and streptococci belonging to group A, C, and G. Of 27 group C and 19 group G streptococcal cultures, 13 and 14, respectively, bound 125I-labeled alpha 2M. Some group A streptococci also interacted with alpha 2M. A number of other bacterial species tested did not react with alpha 2M. The binding of 125I-labeled alpha 2M to group G streptococci was time dependent, saturable, and could be inhibited by unlabeled alpha 2M. Inhibition experiments indicated that the streptococcal binding site for alpha 2M differed from the receptors for immunoglobulin G, fibrinogen, aggregated beta 2-microglobulin, albumin, and fibronectin. The alpha 2M binding activity was remarkably sensitive to trypsin and heat treatment indicating its protein nature. Kinetic analysis indicated a homogenous population of binding sites. The number of binding sites per bacterial cell was estimated to be approximately 20,000.
TI  - Rat arthritis due to whole group B streptococci. Clinical and histopathologic features compared with groups A and D.
AB  - Heat-killed streptococci of Groups A, B, and D injected intraperitoneally into Sprague-Dawley rats induced arthritis. The histopathologic features of the arthritis were those of erosive synovitis. Early acute lesions were associated with deposits of streptococcal antigens. The serogroups and the physical state of the streptococci determined the incidence, the time of onset, the duration, and the severity of the disease, the severity being a blend of degree of inflammation, tendency to relapse, and occurrence of ankylosis. Whole Group A usually failed to induce arthritis. Group A disrupted with sonication regularly induced arthritis after a 24-hour latent period. The disease lasted over 60 days and caused ankylosis. Whole Group B regularly induced arthritis but only after a latent period of 6-8 days. The disease lasted over 40 days and caused ankylosed joints. With sonicated Group B a similar disease was induced, except that, as with sonicated Group A, the latent period was 24 hours. Whole Group D induced disease after a latent period of 48 hours. The arthritis lasted only 2 weeks and was transient. In contrast to its effects on Group A and B cocci, sonication of Group D abrogated its capacity to induce arthritis. It is postulated that for whole streptococci, in contrast to sonicated streptococci, arthritogenicity depends on the sensitivity of the cocci to initial processing in vivo. Processing may be partial digestion by enzymes of phagocytes. Cocci such as those of Group A that are insensitive to processing, injected whole, tend not to cause arthritis, but when they do cause disease, it is chronic. A coccus, such as one of Group D, that is very sensitive to processing produces a transient arthritis after a short latent period, while a coccus of intermediate sensitivity, such as one of Group B, induces disease only after a substantial latent period, and the disease is severe and chronic. The nature of processing remains to be determined.
TI  - [Identification and sensitivity of Streptococci to antibiotics].
AB  - In the first part of this research, the author accentuates the quick and easy identification of the Streptococcus by means of Latex-test, testing at the same time the bacitracin. In the second part, the antibiotic sensitivity is tested on 354 strains of Streptococci.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Cross-reactivity of Haemophilus somnus antibody in agglutination and complement fixation tests and in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
AB  - The specificity and sensitivity of agglutination, complement fixation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures in the detection of antibodies to Haemophilus somnus was investigated. H. somnus rabbit immune sera were found to agglutinate Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus agni and, in some instances, also Pasteurella haemolytica, Salmonella dublin, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Corynebacterium pyogenes. In complement fixation tests with saline extracts as antigens, only H. agni reacted with H. somnus antisera to any significant degree. In ELISA tests with sonicated or heat-extracted antigens, cross-reactions were seen with the two Pasteurella spp. and with H. agni. When whole cells and saline extracts were used as antigens in ELISAs, only H. agni showed any cross-reactivity. The greatest specificity in distinguishing homologous from heterologous reactions was achieved by ELISA with saline extracts as antigens. Escherichia coli and Brucella abortus antigens failed to react with H. somnus antibody in any of the tests. A rabbit serum containing antibody to bovine type isolates of P. multocida, P. haemolytica, S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. dublin, C. pyogenes, and E. coli gave no positive reaction in ELISA tests with saline extract of H. somnus as antigen. It is concluded that such saline extract, which appears to consist largely of H. somnus common antigen, has the potential of being a useful diagnostic reagent in the study by ELISA of antibody response to H. somnus.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - The gut as a source of the haemolytic streptococci causing infection in surgery of the intestinal and biliary tracts.
AB  - In a retrospective review over nearly four years in two Health Districts 84 patients were found to have had non-epidemic, non-enterococcal beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection in surgical conditions of the intestinal and biliary tracts and peritoneum. One third of the patients yielded streptococci from established inflammatory lesions closed to the external body surface and there was strong circumstantial evidence that organisms originated from the intestinal tract. A review of published studies of beta-haemolytic streptococci in the faeces and reports of streptococcal infection associated with the intestines lends support to the concept of the gut as a source of infection.
TI  - The frequency and some characteristics of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various forms of bovine mastitis.
AB  - The prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. The study involved 147 Friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. All herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. No anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. Only anaerobes were present in 10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. A variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. Peptococcus spp. was associated with Corynebacterium pyogenes and Bacteroides spp. with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. Gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-G but all the Gram negative rods were resistant. In addition, all B. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. The ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain of Peptococcus indolicus and a Peptostreptococcus sp.
TI  - Platelet aggregation by Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Heat-killed group A Streptococcus pyogenes induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. Aggregation was dependent upon the ratio of platelets to bacteria, with maximal aggregation occurring at 0.8 platelets per bacterium (final concentration, 300,000 per microliter). Inhibition of the reaction by 3 mM EDTA indicated it was a true aggregation and not merely adhesion and agglutination. Lactic acid dehydrogenase assays indicated lysis of platelets did not occur during a 6-min incubation period. Aggregation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by acetylsalicylic acid (100 microM to 10 mM) and quinacrine (15.6 to 250 microM), with no decrease in aggregation at the lowest concentration of inhibitor tested. S. pyogenes induced the release of [14C]serotonin, which was maximal (50%) at 2.4 min, when aggregation was nearly complete. Gel-filtered platelets were not aggregated unless fibrinogen (final concentration, 1.8 mg/ml) was included in the reaction mixture. Staphylococcus aureus, a group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli were unable to induce aggregation in platelet-rich plasma under the conditions used for S. pyogenes.
TI  - [The antibacterial activity of new cephem antibiotics against clinical isolates.  A comparison of the antibacterial activity of cefotaxime with 6 other antibiotics].
AB  - During the period from May through July 1981, a comparative study was carried out on the antibacterial activities of cefotaxime (CTX) and ceftizoxime (CZX), cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), cefotiam (CTM), cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefazolin (CEZ). CTX and these other cephem antibiotics were tested against fresh clinical isolates which had been obtained from clinical materials by the laboratories of 14 participating medical institutions. 1. The clinical isolates were obtained from various clinical materials in the following decreasing order: urine, sputum and pus/discharge; 85.7% of the isolates came from these materials. 2. Concerning the sources of each species of clinical isolates, it was found that P. aeruginosa was isolated from the greatest number -9- of different clinical materials. This was followed by E. coli and E. cloacae, each isolated from 8 different clinical materials, and C. freundii and E. aerogenes, each found in 7 different clinical materials. 3. In relation to S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, CTX showed the best antibacterial activity; the second most potent antibiotic was CZX. CMZ and LMOX were found to show relatively high MIC values for those species. Against S. aureus, CEZ showed the best antibacterial activity, but 3 resistant strains had MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 4. With regard to Gram-negative bacteria, CTX and CZX showed the best antibacterial activities for all of the species, except for P. aeruginosa. These were followed, in order, by LMOX and CPZ. Compared with these 4 antibiotics, CTM, CMZ and CEZ were found to have inferior antibacterial activities against these bacteria. In relation to P. aeruginosa, the peak of the MIC distribution for CPZ was 6.25 micrograms/ml, and this was the best antibacterial activity detected with the various antibiotics tested. This was followed by CTX (25 micrograms/ml) LMOX (25 micrograms/ml) and CZX (50 micrograms/ml). CTM had an MIC of 100 micrograms/ml for 1 strain, and MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml for all of the other strains of P. aeruginosa, indicating them to be resistant to this antibiotic. All of the strains were resistant to CMZ and CEZ, showing MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 5. For each of the tested antibiotics, no correlation was found between the MIC and the serogroup for either P. aeruginosa or S. marcescens.

TI  - [Experimental mastitis in cows caused by Staphylococci, Streptococci and Corynebacteria].
AB  - Mastitis was experimentally induced in seven cows of the Black-and-white breed through the intramammary or i/v application of bacterial cultures of the encapsulated variant of Staph. epidermidis as well as of Str. agalactiae and Cor. pyogenes. The disease ran a course with high body temperature, strongly manifested inflammatory changes in the mammary gland, and altered phagocytic activity. It was found that the introduction into the mammary gland of a 'stable-specific' bovine blood serum in combination with the preparation nitrofuridine (a Shiff base of the 5-nitrofurfurol with sulfaguanidine) which boosts the phagocytic activity, had produced a therapeutic effect.
TI  - Distribution of beta haemolytic streptococci in pharyngitis specimens obtained from children.
AB  - One hundred and nine isolates of beta haemolytic streptococci were recovered from 840 (13%) pharyngeal cultures obtained from children with acute pharyngitis. Seventy-four percent of these were group A, 4% were group B, 9% were group C, 1% were group D, 4.5% were group F, and 5.5% were group G. The significance of non-group A isolates in pharyngitis could not be evaluated in the absence of viral and serological studies. However, these findings demonstrate the predominance of group A beta haemolytic streptococci in acute pharyngitis in children, as compared to findings in adults.
TI  - The ecology of the streptococci.
AB  - All species of streptococci are divided into several groups according to the ecological niches they occupy. Members of the lactic acid group are found only in the plant environment and the dairy. Members of the pyogenic group and the buccal and intestinal residents of the subthermophilic group are found in intimate association only with homeothermic hosts. Members of the virulent pyogenic group, such asStreptococcus pyogenes, S. equi, andS. infrequens, are restricted to single hosts-the human, the horse, and the pig-whereas others, such asS. agalactiae can be found in several hosts. The intestinal dwellers of the subthermophilic group,S. bovis andS. equinus, occur in several animal species and are not isolated from other sources. The superficially homogeneousS. faecalis of the "enteric" group may actually consist of a group specifically restricted to the human host, and of a second group distributed among wild animals, insects, and plants. The latter group differs from the human type by the ability to hydrolyze starch and to produce a rennin-proteolytic type of curd in milk.Streptococcus faecium is widely distributed in both the homeothermic and poikilothermic environments, but no properties which differentiate the sources are known.Streptococcus faecium biot.casseliflavus has been isolated only from insects and plants.Streptococcus uberis occurs on the bovine lips and skin. Unidentified streptococci from all environments vary widely in properties. Many resembleS. lactis, S. faecalis, andS. faecium.
TI  - Group and type distribution of beta-haemolytic streptococcus strains in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, 1973-1980.
AB  - Group and type differentiation by Griffith' method of agglutination was performed on 7514 haemolytic streptococcal strains isolated from patients with acute streptococcal infections. Thirteen different groups were found--the most frequent were groups A (63.0%), B (12.5%), C (8.1%) and G(2.5%). The group A was predominant among strains isolated from upper respiratory tract, but in later years the frequency of group A strains among streptococci causing respiratory infections was significantly lower. In every year of the study period the most prevalent group A types were T1, T2, T4, T12 and T28--only their relative distribution was changing in the course of time.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of R-plasmids from Streptococcus faecalis to Staphylococcus  aureus.
AB  - R-plasmids originally isolated from Streptococcus pyogenes(pAC1,pAM15346), Streptococcus agalactiae(pIP501), and Streptococcus faecalis(pAM beta 1) were shown to be self-transferable on filter membranes from S. faecalis JH2-2 to Staphylococcus aureus recipients. The nonconjugative plasmid pAM alpha 1 was mobilized into S. aureus by pAM beta 1. Once in S. aureus, conjugative R-plasmids could be transferred to a second S. aureus recipient or back into S. faecalis. Determinants for chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistances present on these streptococcal plasmids were expressed in S. aureus. Agarose gel electrophoresis, dye-buoyant centrifugation, and restriction endonuclease digestion showed that the plasmids were maintained intact as self-replicating elements in S. aureus recipients.
TI  - Immunochemical analysis of streptococcal group A, B, and C carbohydrates, with emphasis on group A.
AB  - Streptococcal group A, B, and C carbohydrates were analyzed by counterimmunoelectrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, and inhibition of immunoprecipitation. Extracts of streptococci group A or C were shown by counterimmunoelectrophoresis to contain both anodic and cathodic migrating components. In immunoelectrophoresis, group A and C substances formed a continuous precipitation line stretching from the anode to the cathode, suggesting a heterogeneous population of molecules with immunochemical identity. This identity was confirmed by inhibition of immunoprecipitation, in which both anodic and cathodic immunoprecipitates were inhibited by the same constituent sugars: group A-anti-A was inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine, and group C-anti-C was inhibited by N-acetylgalactosamine. Extracts of group B showed only anodic migration in counterimmunoelectrophoresis and a narrow, anodic arc in immunoelectrophoresis. The group B-anti-B reaction was inhibited by rhamnose. Carbohydrates of variant strains of group A streptococci were also analyzed by the same methods. The results suggest that the heterogeneity of group A carbohydrate may have resulted from attachment of various amounts of N-acetylglucosamine to the polyrhamnose backbone.
TI  - Gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  - Pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. We studied whether other gram-positive species (groups A and B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. Rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. In vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18% for the control). Infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. Thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate C5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. These alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E, a new clindamycin analog, against aerobic gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a new clindamycin analog, against aerobic gram-positive cocci was studied by microdilution broth susceptibility tests and compared with the activities of clindamycin, vancomycin, oxacillin, and ampicillin. U-57930E inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus viridans at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. This degree of activity was generally slightly less than that of the other antimicrobial agents tested. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci were resistant to U-57930E. At the concentrations used, U-57930E exhibited bactericidal activity against most susceptible organisms, and a minimal effect of inoculum size was noted.
TI  - Presumptive identification of streptococci with a new test system.
AB  - A test is described that could replace bacitracin susceptibility for presumptive  identification of group A streptococci as well as 6.5% NaCl agar tolerance for presumptive identification of enterococcal streptococci. The L-pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide test, based on hydrolysis of pyrrolidonyl-beta-naphthylamide, was used in conjunction with the CAMP and bile-esculin tests to presumptively identify the streptococci. Among the beta-hemolytic streptococci; 98% of 50 group A, 98% of 46 group B, and 100% of 70 strains that were not group A, B, or D were correctly identified by the new presumptive test scheme. Among the non-beta-hemolytic streptococci; 96% of 74 group D enterococcal, 100% of 30 group D nonenterococcal, and 82% of 112 viridans strains were correctly identified by the new presumptive test scheme.

TI  - Polysaccharase activity in Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci).
AB  - Of 300 recently isolated strains of Streptococcus agalactiae from human sources,  97% degraded starch. Representative strains also degraded glycogen, pullulan, amylopectin and amylose. The polysaccharase activity is easily detected by clearing around growth on Columbia agar base medium. The activity is weaker than that of some S. pyogenes strains, and it does not appear to produce fermentable products but is inhibited by the presence of easily used sugars.
TI  - Comparison of slide agglutination test (Phadebact) with counterimmunoelectrophoresis for detection of streptococcal group antigens.
AB  - Sera from mice infected with group B streptococci and culture supernatants of group B, A, and C streptococci were examined for the presence of group-specific antigens by the Phadebact slide agglutination (PSA) test and counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE). The results were correlated with the number of organisms present in the blood or in vitro cultures. The PSA test was slightly more sensitive than CIE.
TI  - Agglutination of bacteria by a sialic acid-specific lectin of the snail Cepaea hortensis.
AB  - Aqueous extracts from lyophilized albumen glands of the garden snail (Cepaea hortensis) exhibit, after separation from a second lectin, a specificity against sialic acid-containing polymers. In agglutination studies with bacteria, the lectin interacts with all strains of group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae) containing type-specific polysaccharides. In contrast, group B streptococci containing only protein type antigens as well as all strains of other Lancefield streptococcal groups and several other bacterial strains did not react.
TI  - The antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. Furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Stable L-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial L-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, viridans group Streptococcus, enterococcus, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species, and Lactobacillus species. Antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against S. aureus, S. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans Streptococcus. The combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against S. aureus.
TI  - Improved streptococcal grouping antisera containing polyethylene glycol.
AB  - Antisera to streptococcal groups A through G containing 4% polyethylene glycol 6000 were prepared and evaluated. Seventy strains of homologous and heterologous beta- and non-beta-hemolytic streptococci were included in the evaluation. Homologous reactions were determined against extracts prepared by four extraction methods: hot hydrochloric acid (Lancefield) extraction, autoclave extraction, hot formamide extraction, and nitrous acid extraction. Enhancement of the precipitin reaction in the presence of polyethylene glycol 6000 permitted a fourfold dilution of all antisera for use in the capillary precipitin test. At this dilution, the potency of the antisera exceeded requirements established for these reagents.

TI  - [Prophylaxis and treatment of streptococcus infections (author's transl)].
AB  - Authors review and bring up to date problems related to prophylaxis and treatment of streptococcus infections in children. In those caused by the Group A streptococcus, the problem is rather one of medical education and practical application of techniques, and medicines. Active vaccination is still a remote possibility. In the case of streptococcus B and its perinatological incidence, there is still no standard therapeutic prophylaxis covering both the mother and child. With reference to streptococcus D plans proposed are somewhat discordant since it is difficult to carry out studies with sufficiently large groups but there are also proposals which can be carried out perfectly well and are reasonably safe. As far as the infectious, and to a great extent contagious, processes are concerned, measures of individual and collective hygiene are particularly important.

TI  - Streptococcal infections in pregnancy. A study of 48 bacteremias.
AB  - During a 4-year period, 48 obstetric patients with aerobic streptococcal bacteremia were identified. The isolates were group B (31); group D, enterococci (5); group A (4); group D, not enterococci (3); Streptococcus pneumoniae (3); and viridans streptococci (2). The most common diagnoses were endometritis (36) and chorioamnionitis (8). For all streptococcal genital infections, the clinical presentation included early-onset fever, often with few localizing signs. Only one patient had a chronic debilitating disease. There was an excellent correlation between genital and bloodstream isolates (36 of 42). Maternal response to therapy was good, with no deaths nor episodes of septic shock. Possible infectious complications developed in two fetuses and four neonates. The microbiologic and clinical features of aerobic streptococci were reviewed, and the outcome in obstetric patients and that in other adults were compared.
TI  - Mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  - A medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. Mannitol agar supported growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except Corynebacterium pyogenes. Color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. Most Staphylococcus aureus strains and some Staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. These yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from quarters with significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (SCC) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. Mannitol-negative strains of S epidermidis (those with red zones) were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters. The streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: Streptococcus agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, and group G streptococci produced red zones; Str uberis, Str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. Pathogenic streptococci (Str agalactiae, Str dysgalactiae, Str uberis, and group G streptococci) were obtained from quarters with SCC significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. Streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with SCC similar to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. Pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.
TI  - Synergism, killing kinetics, and antimicrobial susceptibility of group A and B streptococci.
AB  - The susceptibility of 110 group A and 179 group B streptococci to 25 antimicrobics was tested by broth microdilution and agar disk diffusion tests. Representative strains were used in killing kinetics, penicillin-gentamicin synergy, and minimal bactericidal concentration tests. Group A streptococci were more susceptible than group B streptococci to 17 of the 25 antimicrobics tested. Group A and B streptococci were killed at the same rate if the amount of penicillin used was equivalent to their respective penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations. Synergism was demonstrated for both group A and B streptococci when penicillin was used at concentrations equal to each respective minimal inhibitory concentration and subinhibitory concentration of gentamicin. This synergy could be demonstrated best using minimal bactericidal concentrations obtained by culturing 3- and 6-h cultures from the microdilution checkerboard tests rather than from 24-h subcultures. A greater synergistic effect was achieved by adding penicillin first and then adding gentamicin rather than in the reverse order, or simultaneously.

TI  - Binding of fibrinogen degradation products to S. aureus and to beta-hemolytic streptococci group A, C and G.
AB  - Binding of fibrinogen degradation products was measured to Gram-positive cocci known to carry receptors for human fibrinogen. Forty-one strains of S. aureus and group A, C and G streptococci were studied. The largest plasmin produced fragment (X-fragment, HMWDP) showed higher binding levels to the bacterial receptors in all four species as compared to intact fibrinogens. The enzymatically produced C-terminal fragment D was strongly reactive, whereas the N-terminal fragment E was non-reactive. Inhibition experiments showed that reactive fragments were bound to the same receptors as fibrinogen. Three chemically-produced and well-characterized fragments from the terminal and the middle portions of the fibrinogen molecule were all negative in binding assays. The binding patterns for fibrinogen and the fragments tested were identical in the four bacterial species tested, S. aureus and group A, C and G streptococci. The results confirm and extend earlier data on similarities between fibrinogen receptors on these Gram-positive bacterial species.
TI  - Optimal methods for the isolation of groups A, B, C and G streptococci.
AB  - The recovery of beta-haemolytic streptococci on laboratory media over a 48-hour period was studied from a variety of swabs held in plastic containers only, and from those held in transport media, stored either at room temperature or at 4 degrees C. The best results were obtained from swabs not held in transport medium and of these plain cotton-wool swabs consistently produced optimal results. The percentage recovery over 48 hours was maintained satisfactorily only when the swabs were kept at 4 degrees C.
TI  - Streptococcal submandibular cellulitis in young infants.
AB  - Six infants with streptococcal submandibular cellulitis and bacteremia were managed in our institution during a seven-month period. Five uncomplicated cases were caused by group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and one rapidly progressive case of Ludwig's angina was caused by group A Streptococcus. Recognition of this characteristic clinical presentation of group B streptococcal infection may be beneficial in the management of such patients.

Clinical isolates were all resistant to bacitracin. 2. Serotypes of 19 isolates were type III in 12 strains, Ia in 3, Ic in 2 and untypable in 2. 3. The MICs were determined to 15 antibiotics, and the results showed that penicillin G was the best and in the order of decreasing potency, cefotaxime, ampicillin, ceftizoxime and cefoperazone. 4. Compared with group A Streptococcus, the sensitivity of group B Streptococcus to penicillin G and ampicillin was inferior by 2 to 3 tubes. 5. Based on the above results, the significance of the cephalosporin antibiotic of the third generation, particularly cefotaxime, was evaluated in the treatment of infectious diseases of the newborn infants.
TI  - Detection of streptococcal antigen by counterimmunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Rapid detection systems for identifying antibody or bacterial antigen have been used for two to three years. The analysis for the presence of bacterial antigen by counterimmunoelectrophoresis has been used in the detection of neonatal and pediatric infections. In the present report, the previous data concerning the detection of group B streptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid, sera, and urine of infected newborns was reinforced. Counterimmunoelectrophoresis was also established as a method for detecting group B streptococcal antigen in amniotic fluid and group D streptococcal antigen in body fluids, and for verifying group A streptococcal antigen from 24-hour culture plates. This is a further extension of the use by the clinical laboratory of counterimmunoelectrophoresis in the detection of bacterial antigen.
TI  - Carbohydrate fingerprints of streptococcal cells.
AB  - The carbohydrates of whole cells of group A, B, C, D, F, and G streptococci were  analyzed with a highly sensitive gas chromatographic procedure. Characteristic chromatographic fingerprints were obtained for each group of streptococci grown in broth cultures or as single colonies on a blood agar plate. Rhamnose, glucose, and N-acetylglucosamine were major components of all the groups. Groups A, C, and F contained very little galactose, and groups A and B showed almost a complete absence of N-acetylgalactosamine. Chromatograms obtained for group B streptococci were distinguished by the presence of 1,4-anhydroglucitol.
TI  - Properties of a hemolysin produced by group B streptococci.
AB  - A hemolysin that appears to be responsible for the zones of beta-hemolysis surrounding colonies of group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae) on blood agar plates has been isolated and partially purified. No soluble hemolysin was detectable in the supernatants of streptococcal cultures grown in several types of media. However, hemolytic activity was detected when streptococci were incubated with erythrocytes, and soluble hemolysin was isolated when bacterial suspensions were incubated in the presence of a variety of agents, including calf serum, albumin, Tween 80, and starch. Glucose and other fermentable carbohydrates stimulated hemolysin production, and metabolic inhibitors greatly reduced the titer of hemolysin that could be recovered, suggesting that cellular metabolism is necessary for hemolysin production or release. The soluble hemolysin was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and partially purified by gel filtration. Agents known to inhibit other streptococcal hemolysins, including phospholipids, trypan blue, proteases, and cholesterol, were tested for their effect on the group B hemolysin. Only the phospholipids inhibited hemolysin activity. The group B streptococcal hemolysin appears to be similar to, but distinct from, streptolysin S produced by Streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  - A survey of mastitis in the British dairy herd.
AB  - Five hundred herds were examined to determine the prevalence of subclinical mastitis in the British dairy herd. The prevalences of the various infections recorded were Streptococcus agalactiae 3.4 per cent of quarters, S dysgalactiae 1.1 per cent, S uberis 1.5 per cent and Staphylococcus pyogenes 8.1 per cent. There were regional differences in the prevalence of some of these pathogens. The national prevalence of subclinical mastitis as defined by the International Dairy Federation was 9.6 per cent of all quarters. Udder infections were less prevalent in herds where mastitis control measures were being used. The prevalence of infection also declined as the size of herd increased. However, as the uptake of mastitis control measures was greater in the larger herds it seems likely that the widespread use of control measures was the most important factor responsible for the relatively low prevalence of subclinical mastitis.
TI  - Transferability of macrolide, lincomycin, and streptogramin resistances between group A, B, and D streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The transferability of plasmid pRI405 between various streptococci of groups A, B, and D, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus is described. pRI405 originated from Streptococcus faecalis and encodes for resistance to macrolides, lincomycin, and streptogramin B (MLS resistance). The host range of the well-documented streptococcal plasmid pAM beta 1 was found to be similar to that of pRI405. Cleavage with restriction enzymes suggests that pRI405 belongs to a related family of MLS resistance plasmids.

AB  - Methods for group classification of beta-hemolytic streptococci were compared: biochemical versus serological techniques as well as Triple- and CAMP-Test. Attention was mainly put to the Phadebact streptococcus test, based on the co-agglutination principle which is intended to differentiate groups A, B, C and G. This test is easy to conduct and allows grouping within minutes. Classification was done with 50 strains of clinical isolates. Approximately 88% of the strains were identified as group A and B which are the most important in human streptococcal infections. The co-agglutination gave false results with 6 strains (8%), one of which was group A. The others turned out to be S. milleri, they could be identified only by the Lancefield precipitin test. In cases where several Phadebact antisera lead to an agglutination of one strain, the questionable result must be verified by conventional methods.
TI  - Biochemical and immunological characterization of the extracellular nucleases of  group B streptococci.
AB  - Nearly all group B streptococcal strains representing the five major serotypes were found to produce extracellular nucleases by screening with an agar-well-diffusion technique in DNA-methyl green agar plates. Three different nucleases have been isolated and partially purified by DEAE-and carboxymethyl-cellulose chromatography. They possessed different mobilities on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and different molecular weights. These nucleases, designated I, II, and III, are optimally activated by cations of calcium and manganese and exhibited RNase as well as DNase activity. Despite differences in their physical and biochemical properties, nucleases II and III appear antigenically similar, but distinct from nuclease I. These group B streptococcal nucleases are immunologically different from the nucleases of group A streptococci. Neutralizing activity, probably antibody, to nucleases II and III was found in human sera, and was most prevalent in sera of pregnant women colonized with group B streptococci and in their newborn infants.
TI  - [Co-agglutination as an alternative to precipitin testing in streptococcal grouping (author's transl)].
AB  - Grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococcal strains was performed over a six months  period on a total of 102 isolates. The purpose was to compare the Lancefield method with three different possibilities offered by the Co-agglutination technique. The results show that the Co-agglutination is as reliable as precipitin testing but it can be much more sensitive and rapid than any other method.
TI  - Production of pyrogenic exotoxin by groups of streptococci: association with group A.
AB  - Several groups of streptococci were tested for production of pyrogenic exotoxins  (SPE) with Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, a newly developed passive hemagglutination inhibition assay, and an assay for pyrogenicity and capacity to enhance lethal endotoxin shock. With use of these assays, 68 (91%) of 75 group A streptococcal strains were positive for one or more of SPE types A, B, and C; seven were negative for both the known SPE types and antigenically unrelated pyrogenic exotoxins. Group A strains producing both SPE B and C were the most common, and strains producing A alone or AB and AC together were the least common. All of 11 rheumatogenic group A streptococci elaborated SPE C either alone or together with one or both of SPE types A and B. The 10 nephritogenic strains tested were positive for SPE B; five were positive for B alone. In contrast to group A streptococci, non-group A strains (41 tested) did not produce the known SPE types, and 19 of 19 tested were negative for antigenically unrelated pyrogenic exotoxins. Group A strains from Holland, India, and Japan also elaborated SPE. Several group A streptococci used widely in laboratory experiments were tested for SPE types produced.

TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - LY127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. The lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)s) of LY127935 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. The MIC(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. The MIC(90)s for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC(90)s for anaerobes ranged from 2 to >32 mug/ml. As determined by MIC(90)s, LY127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. In a population of multidrug-resistant isolates, concentrations of 8 mug or less of LY127935 per ml inhibited 82% of Enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacteriaceae and 40% of P. aeruginosa. Increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of LY127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some Enterobacteriaceae. All four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. The broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of LY127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  - Susceptibility of streptococci to newer tetracyclines and cephalosporins and to other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Two hundred and thirty-nine strains of Streptococcus including 71 strains of Group A, 81 strains of Group B, 69 strains of enterococci, and 18 strains of S. pneumoniae were tested against 12 antimicrobial agents using an agar dilution method. Cefamandole was the most active cephalosporin tested. Doxycycline and minocycline were more active than tetracycline, although the tetracyclines were considerably less inhibitory than the cephalosporins. Regression line analysis of zones of inhibition versus minimal inhibitory concentration values for tetracycline and minocycline showed the tetracycline disc to be unacceptable for predicting the susceptibility of the Group A Streptococcus to minocycline. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin, and spectinomycin are also given.

TI  - Quantitative assay of soluble beta-hemolytic streptococcal antigens via an immunochemical turbidimetric method with a spectrophotometer.
AB  - Soluble, group A, B, C, and G beta-hemolytic streptococcal antigens were successfully identified in a prototype spectrophotometric system by an immunochemical turbidimetric assay. Any spectrophotometic system which can take a zero reading followed by a second reading 2 or more min later can be used for the assay. Maximum absorbance was obtained near a wavelength of 340 nm. A wide range of linearity between antigen concentration and absorbance was observed at some antibody dilutions, resulting in a simple assay which can be used to quantitate amounts of antigen in solution. Minimal cross-reactions that present no problem in interpretation was observed. Simulated emergency samples were solubilized and assayed for group A and B bacteria within 3 h of colony recognition. Reproducibility of the absorbance resulting from the antibody-antigen reaction was great, with low coefficients of variation over a period of 50 days. The simplicity of the assay solutions, requiring only antisera and a buffer, and the accessibility to high levels of quality control are among the greatest assets of the technique to clinical laboratories.
TI  - Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci causing pharyngitis.
AB  - Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from the throats of 49 of 1,110 patients who had pharyngitis. Compared with patients whose throat cultures were negative for beta-hemolytic streptococci, those harboring group B were more likely to have enlarged tonsils (P less than 0.001), exudate (P less than 0.02), and tender enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes (P less than 0.01). Group B should not necessarily be dismissed as a nonpathogen when identified in the pharynx of patients with exudative pharyngitis; laboratories which report beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates from the pharynx only as group A or non-group A should be encouraged to perform definitive group identification of all beta-hemolytic isolates to further evaluate the role of other streptococcal groups as the causative agents for pharyngitis.
TI  - Rapid slide agglutination test for Lancefield grouping of streptococci.
AB  - A rapid slide agglutination test (the Phadebact [PB] Streptococcus test) was compared with the standard autoclave extraction method of Lancefield and presumptive clinical laboratory tests for grouping of streptococci (bacitracin disk sensitivity for group A and sodium hippurate hydrolysis for group B). Identification of group A streptococci by the PB kit was statistically as accurate as by the Lancefield method, whereas bacitracin grouping was significantly less accurate than the Lancefield method (P = less than .02). With regard to group B, there was no statistically significant difference between the PB test and the sodium hippurate test. The PB test correctly identified all group C and G streptococci. The PB kit provides a rapid and reliable method for Lancefield grouping of streptococci.
TI  - Presumptive identification of group A, B, and D streptococci on agar plate media.
AB  - Several presumptive tests were evaluated for their effectiveness in differentiating streptococci. When the tests were combined into a battery and the resulting reactions were interpreted as patterns, the overall presumptive identification rate was at least 97%. We used the hemolytic reaction, susceptibility to bacitracin and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim (1.25 micrograms plus 23.75 micrograms), and standard CAMP reactions on sheep blood Trypticase soy agar, and bile-esculin and 6.5% NaCl agar tolerance tests with incubation in candle extinction jars. Subsequently, 98.9% of the group A; 95.3% of the group B; 100% of the beta-hemolytic non-group A, B, or D; 92.3% of group D enterococcal; 100% of the group D non-enterococcal; and 92.8% of the viridans streptococci were presumptively identified. We then used the hemolytic reactions, susceptibility of bacitracin and sulfamethoxazole-plus-trimethoprim disks, CAMP disk reactions on sheep blood Trypticase soy agar and bile-esculin and 6.5% NaCl agar tolerance tests with incubation in normal atmosphere. Subsequently, 98.1% of the group A; 98.6% of the group B; 99.2% of the beta hemolytic non-group A, B, or D; 97.5% of the group D entercoccal; 97.6% of the group D non-entercoccal; and 92.4% of the viridans strains were presumptively identified.

In B, E, H, K, L, M, P, S, T streptococci groups there was revealed only one, and in C and G streptococci groups--two antigens identical to the HTC antigens of streptococci, group A. Besides, an antigen, which was apparently specific specific for group A streptococcus only, was detected. The data obtained should be taken into consideration in the elaboration of improved method of grouping and typing group A streptococcus.
TI  - Non-group D streptococcal meningitis misidentified as enterococcal meningitis. Diagnostic and therapeutic implications of misdiagnosis by screening microbiology.
AB  - Two patients had nonhemolytic Gram-positive coccal meningitis. Both pathogens were initially misidentified as a group D enterococcus by growth in "selective" media, which led to the use of inappropriate and potentially toxic systemic and intrathecal aminoglycosides. Careful evaluation of the antibiotic sensitivity data and additional microbiological studies allowed correct identification of the organism. The important diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in differentiating true enterococcal infections, especially meningitis, from those caused by other alpha-hemolytic or nonhemolytic streptococci are emphasized. A simple laboratory schema for rapid recognition of such pathogens is reviewed.

The bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were Streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), Neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), Hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), Enterobacteriaceae (four patients), Staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups A and B) (three patients), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). Thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. Further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.
TI  - Bacitracin and coagglutination for grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  - Bacitracin may be used for presumptive differentiation of group A from other beta-hemolytic streptococci. Whatever criteria are used for the test, a small number of erroneous results will be obtained. With the 1,161 strains studied in this laboratory, using a zone of 10 mm or greater as indicative of group A was better than using Maxted's original criterion of any zone of inhibition for group A. Co-agglutination is a preferable alternative to bacitracin testing, providing a grouping result as quickly as the bacitracin test but with the advantage of giving a definite grouping result. With the 247 strains studied so far, coagglutination results have correlated exactly with results of conventional grouping by a precipitin method.
TI  - Streptococcal endocarditis initially seen as septic arthritis.
AB  - Two patients were initially seen with culture-positive streptococcal arthritis as an early manifestation of bacterial endocarditis. The organisms were an alpha-hemolytic, nongroup D streptococcus and a beta-hemolytic, group b streptococcus. One patient had a persistent septic monarthritis; the other had migratory arthritis in which a positive synovial culture was followed by a negative culture from the same joint before antimicrobial treatment was started. This experience suggests that some sterile synovial aspirates encountered in patients with bacterial endocarditis may be explained by delay of arthrocentesis.

AB  - A rapid modification of the co-agglutination (COA) technique for grouping A, B, C and G beta-haemolytic streptococci was developed. The results are obtained within three hours after inoculation from primary plates of 0.5 ml broth. This method was compared to the fluorescent antibody test (FA) and counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE), two other rapid methods available for serological grouping of streptococci. Of 71 recently isolated streptococcal strains from clinical sources, 70 were correctly grouped in COA, 63 in FA and 68 in CIE. With commercial reagents COA compared favourably in accuracy to the other methods and can be recommended for routine serological grouping of beta-haemolytic streptococci in the clinical laboratory.

AB  - We collected 1,353 strains of beta-hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, C, and  G (1,176 strains of which were group A) isolated in 26 institutions throughout Japan in 1972-1974. The strains were grouped and T-typed by our specific group-and T-factor sera, and the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 10 antibiotics were assayed by the standard method. Resistant strains from the above collection were classified according to group, T-type, and drug resistance pattern. Our data on T-types for 1964-1971 and on drug resistance for 1966-1971 were used to interpret the detected long-term variations in T-type and drug resistance. The stepwise acquisition of multiple drug resistance, the difference in resistance pattern between predominant T-types, and the rarity of single-macrolide resistance were demonstrated.

AB  - Grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates by staphylococcal coagglutination was performed with the Phadebact Streptococcus Test to determine whether such isolates could be accurately grouped serologically with 4 h after examination of the primary isolation plates. Of 132 clinical isolates, 131 were correctly grouped by the Phadebact method using the Lancefield precipitation method as the accepted standard. Of the correctly grouped streptococci, 119 were definitively grouped within 4 h after examination of the primary plates, and the remaining 12 isolates were grouped within 24 h. Since the Phadebact Streptococcus Test contains coagglutination reagents for groups A, B, C, and G, those isolates that failed to react were considered as positive for groups other than the four included in the test system. There were 23 such isolates in this study. Lancefield grouping of these isolates indicated that nine were group F, five were group D, and the remaining nine were not groupable with the Lancefield reagents employed in this study. The one Phadebact "failure" involved an isolate that produced a 4 + reaction with the Phadebact group A reagent and a 4 + reaction with Lancefield group F reagent.
TI  - Selective and enhanced recovery of group A and B streptococci from throat cultures with sheep blood agar containing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.
AB  - Sheep blood agar containing 23.75 microgram of sulfamethoxazole and 1.25 microgram of trimethoprim (SXT-BA) per ml was compared with conventional sheep blood agar (SBA) for isolating group A and B streptococci from throat cultures. This selective medium allowed much better recovery of group A and B streptococci and suppressed the growth of the normal flora, including "viridans" streptococci. In an initial study of 700 throat cultures, SXT-BA recovered 42% more group A and 49% more group B streptococci than did SBA. When SXT-BA was introduced into the routine microbiology laboratory and used by a number of medical technologists. SXT-BA recovered 28% more group A and 37% more group B streptococci than did SBA. In addition, the selective medium inhibited 83% of the non-group A and B streptococci that were recovered by SBA.

AB  - The colonization of mucosal cells in the oral cavity of newborn infants was studied at various intervals after birth in an attempt to define the nature of the epithelial binding sites for group A streptococci and their lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Stained smears of buccal mucosal cells showed that the average number of naturally acquired bacteria/cell was zero to one in infants less than one day old, one to four in infants one day old, and 11-19 in infants two days old. Samples of the same mucosal cells were incubated with group A streptococci, and the average number of streptococci bound per cell was 10-31 in infants less than one day old, 33-62 in one-day-old infants, and 75-100 in two-day-old infants. Experiments that were repeated with group B streptococci type III produced similar results. LTA, the substance that mediates the binding of streptococci to epithelial cells, was similarly bound by fewer buccal mucosal cells obtained within 6 hr of birth than cells obtained during the next 48 hr. Streptococcal and LTA binding reached adult levels between 48 and 72 hr after birth. No difference was shown in the streptococcal binding capacity of oral epithelial cell obtained from mothers at term and cells obtained from other normal adults. Preincubation of adult buccal cells with amniotic fluid did not decrease streptococcal binding. These studies demonstrated a scant capacity of the oral mucosal cells of neonates to bind LTA and streptococci and suggest that LTA-binding sites are developed or unmasked during the first few days after birth.
TI  - [Occurrence and etiology for subclinical mastitis in cows].
AB  - Studied were a total of 16,571 cows on 89 farms by means of the Bernburg test. Milk was sampled from the positively reacting quarters of the udder by taking 18,047 samples intended for bacteriologic investigation. The demonstration of mastitis streptococci was carried out on "TKT" agar Merk, of pathogenic staphylococci, hemolytic streptococci, and Corinebacteria--on dextrose agar Oxoid containing 7.5% citrated calf blood. The isolated hemolytic streptococcus bacteria from the two nutrient media were differentiated through the CAMP test as well as serologically by the precipitation agar gel and Difco sera. The pathogenicity of Staphylococcus bacteria, in addition through hemolysis, was tested by the use of plasma coagulase with citrated rabbit plasma. In 53.95% of the cases there were secretory lesions due to Sc. agalactiae (6.23%) to Sc. dysgalactiae (5.69%) to Sc. uberis (8.47%), to Staph. aureus (2.44%), to hemolytic streptococci of the C, G and L groups (0.28%), to Sc. viridans (0.03%), to Corynebacterium pyogenes (0.41%), and catarrhal mastitis (30.4%). Some of the causative agents, such as Sc. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and others have proved of epidemiologic importance to humans.

TI  - Distribution of antibodies to streptococcal esterases in patients with scarlet fever.
AB  - Repetitive counterelectrophoresis (RCE), which has been described (Hayano and Tanaka, 1977), was used to assay the contents of antibodies to streptococcal esterases (STE) in sera from patients with scarlet fever. The levels of antibodies to STE were expressed semiquantitatively by reading the intensity of the colored spot developed by RCE with a densitometer. The present study deals with the determination of anti-STE in sera drawn at intervals from 54 patients diagnosed as suffering from scarlet fever. The STE used in this study were prepared from the streptococcal strains as follows. STE-AI was prepared from SS379 (group A, type 40), STE-AII from strain 69882 (group A, type 49), STE-B from strain H36B (group B, lb), and STE-C from strain Austin (group C). Of the 54 cases studied, 32 (59.3%) showed anti-STE-AI, 24 (44.4%) showed anti-STE-AII, 5 (9.3%) showed anti-STE-B, and 23 (42.6%) showed anti-STE-C. Comparison of the titer of anti-streptolysin O (ASLO) with the type of specific reaction of anti-STE-AI and -AII, determined in the same specimen, showed a marked correlation. Of 20 cases giving ASLO titers of 12 or less, 18 showed no sign of anti-STE-AI and -AII and two showed signs of anti-STE-AI. Of 34 cases giving ASLO titers of more than 12, 33 showed signs of anti-STE-AI and/or -AII, 22 showed signs of anti-STE-AI and -AII, 7 showed signs of anti-STE-AI, and 4 showed signs of anti-STE-AII. Of all the cases, 26 showed coincident rises in titers of ASLO and levels of anti-STE-AI and/or -AII during the course of the disease. One case showed the presence of only anti-STE-B. All of the 23 cases that showed the presence of anti-STE-C showed signs of anti-STE-AI. Some of these cases showed a marked increase in levels of anti-STE-C during the course of the disease.
TI  - Repetitive counterelectrophoresis on agar gel for the immunological identification of esterases produced by strains of Lancefield's group A, B, and C streptococci.
AB  - A method, repetitive counterelectrophoresis (RCE), was devised for detecting specific antibody to streptococcal esterase (STE). Reference antisera were prepared by immunizing rabbits with STE of streptococcal strains as follows: SS379 (group A, type 40), 69882 (group A, type 49), and H36B (group B, type Ib). Some human sera, derived from patients with scarlet fever, were also used as references. By this method, we have confirmed the immunological specificity of the STE produced by strains SS379 (STE-AI), 69882 (STE-AII), H36B (STE-B), and Austin (STE-C, group C) and have shown that the STE produced by strain 10706 (group C) is immunologically identical with STE-AI. Each STE presented a distinct colored line with the respective homologous antibody upon development of enzyme activity except for STE-AII, which formed a round spot with the homologous antibody. Horse activating factor (Hayano and Tanaka, 1973) formed a round spot with each STE. The factor in serum that reacted specifically with STE seemed to correspond to gamma globulin.

Bacterial germs responsible for the inflammation of the mammary gland were found in the milk of 18.91% of cows. These were: Streptococcus agalactiae (in 13.93% of cows), Staphylococcus aureus (2.86%), other streptococci (1.32%), E. coli (0.13%), Klebsiella sp. (0.13%), Corynebacterium pyogenes (0.15%), other bacterial germs (0.39%). Streptococci and staphylococci, taken together, represented 95.83% of all bacterial germs, Streptococcus agalactiae representing 73.72%. In comparison with the situation existing in 1974, a drop was found in the occurrence rate of the germs of Streptococcus agalactiae (by 2.94%) and Staphylococcus aureus (by 1.16%).
TI  - [Devitalizing effect of Jodonal A in vitro on bacteria subject to a short-term exposure].
AB  - In a three-minute exposure in vitro Jodonal A devitalized a culture of serological group B streptococci in a 2% concentration, Staphylococcus aureus in a 16% concentration, Pneumococcus in a 4.5% concentration, Corynebacterium pyogenes in a 2.5% concentration, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a 3% concentration, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 2% concentration. Hence Jodonal A concentrations higher than 16% should be tested for udder teat disinfection after the removal of teat cups.
TI  - [Determination of the effective concentration of Jodonal a for the disinfection of the skin and teats after milking].
AB  - The bactericidal effectivity of Jodonal A in 1:10, 1:5, and 1:3 solutions was tested on human skin and on the teats of cow mammary glands. The 1:3 dilution ratio proved best for three-minute exposure. Jodonal A used in this concentration in 522 cows for the post-milking disinfection of teats for 10 months exerted no harmful effect on the skin of the mammary glands.
TI  - Streptococci and aerococci associated with systemic infection in man.
AB  - A collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. Of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. The endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: Streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and usually mannitol-fermenting strains of S. bovis (S. bovis I), 15-1%; S. mutans, 14-2%; S. mitior, 13-2%. Streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (S. sanguis, S. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. When the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (S. mutans, S. bovis I, S. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling S. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. Endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. In young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. Infections with S. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with S. bovis I at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. A history of previous heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. The streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was S. milleri (29-3%). It was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. The only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. In other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and S. milleri.
TI  - Antibiotic-killing kinetics of group B streptococci.
AB  - Group B streptococci are uniformly susceptible to penicillin or ampicillin. Nevertheless, morbidity and mortality in newborn infants infected with group B streptococci is a major clinical problem. Bacteriologic determinants in the outcome of this infection were studied. Streptococcal killing kinetics were studied for ampicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin. In all cases killing was accelerated by the combination. The practice of discontinuing administration of the aminoglycoside antibiotic when group B streptococcal infection is confirmed should be re-evaluated.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.
TI  - A retrospective study of the occurrence of beta-haemolytic streptococci of various Lancefield groups in routine cultures from the County of Uppsala.
AB  - During the months October to December of the years 1971-1974 the incidence of beta-haemolytic streptococci of the Lancefield groups, A, B, C and G from patients in the County of Uppsala was studied. The proportion of culture positive patients increased during the period studied from 7.2% to 13.7%. The increase was not only due to group A. In cultures from the respiratory tract the finding of group A streptococci increased from 4.1% to 10.7% and group C from 0.1% to 1.6%, while group B and G streptococci remained constant. In cultures from wound infections the percentage of patients culture positive for group A streptococci increased from 6.2% to 8.7%, group B from 0.8% to 1.9%, and group G from 0.5% to 0.9%, while group C remained constant. During the same months of the years 1972 to 1974 the frequency of sera with an antistreptolysin O titre of more than 1 000 U/ml increased from 0.6% t0 2.3% in the same region. A clinical study of scarlet fever and pharyngotonsillitis at the Department of Infectious Diseases showed a similar trend concerning group A streptococcal infections. These results stress the great importance of group A beta-haemolytic streptocci in human infections and indicate that the recent interest in non-group A infections should be continued.

TI  - Streptococcal infections--updated.
AB  - Streptococci are amont the most common bacterial pathogens physicians encounter in practice. Infections with streptococci continue to occur with significant frequency despite the general sensitivity of these organisms to a variety of widely used antibiotics. In newborn infants and other special patient groups, streptococci may produce fulminant and fatal sepsis (Table 1). In normal children and adults, infections usually are short term and often mild or unrecognized but with the possibility of resulting, unpredictably, in nonsuppurative complications some weeks or months later. Although scarlet fever has become an unusual and clinically attenuated disease, its rashless analog, streptococcal pharyngitis, presents thorny problems in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic patients and in the detection of subclinical infections. Erysipelas now is a rare disease, but recent studies have confirmed that streptococci often are the primary etiologic agent in impetigo, another type of skin infection--with peculiar bacteriologic and epidemiologic features. Infections with group D streptococci have always been a special case because of their frequent resistance to penicillin, and group B streptococci (also somewhat resistant) present special problems in the perinatal period. Streptococci may appear in unexpected places or guises (see Table 1). Thus, the modern physician has little reason to relax in his vigilance for and knowledge of streptococcal infections.
TI  - [Etiology of mastitis in dairy cows in Slovakia during 1972-1974].
AB  - In the period from 1972 to 1974, veterinary institutes in Slovakia performed bacteriological examinations in 178,853 milk samples coming from 72,454 dairy cows. On an annual average, the number of examined samples was higher by 61% than in 1967-1971. Germs responsible for the inflammation of the mammary gland were found in the milk of 22.32% of the dairy cows. The following bacterial germs were represented: Streptococcus agalactiae - 15.77%, Staphylococcus aureus - 4.19%, other streptococci - 1.49%, E. coli - 0.18%, Klebsiella sp. - 0.23%, Corynebacterium pyogenes - 0.20%, other germs - 0.26%. The number of dairy cows having bacterial germs in their milk was found higher by 1.47% than in 1967-1971. The number of the findings of Streptococcus agalactiae was higher by 3.29% and that of Straphylococcus aureus by 1.15% than in the period from 1967 to 1971. The higher number of the findings of the bacterial causative agents responsible for mastitis was due, in particular, to the increased number of the findings of Streptococcus agalactiae in milk.

TI  - Migration inhibition of peritoneal macrophages by peptidoglycan.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that peptidoglycans from group A and B streptococci inhibit the migration of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized rats and guinea pigs. In the present studies peptidoglycans from S. aureus and S. epidermidis were found to inhibit the migration of cells to the same extent as group A streptococcal peptidoglycan. In contrast, HSA-pentapeptide, an immunologically active synthetic analog of the peptide moiety of peptidoglycan which is free of the intrinsic toxicity of naturally occurring peptidoglycans, did not induce migration inhibition of peritoneal exudate cells from non-sensitized guinea pigs. Sensitization of animals with 200 mug HSA-pentapeptide emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of streptococcal and staphylococcal peptidoglycan; HSA-pentapeptide again showed no activity. However, when HSA-pentapeptide was tested against cells from animals sensitized with 200 mug HSA-pentapeptide incorporated in complete Freund's adjuvant, a strong inhibition of migration was evident. Skin tests performed in these animals, in contrast to the dermonecrotic reaction elicited by streptococcal or staphylococcal peptidoglycan, revealed a characteristic delay hypersensitivity to HSA-pentapeptide.
TI  - Herd incidence of bovine mastitis in four Danish dairy. districts II. Evaluation  of the effect of the mastitis control scheme.
AB  - Bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four Danish dairy districts. After a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. The rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to 12% on a quarter basis. A comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three Danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. Together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has taken place during that period. In particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of Group B, C, G, and L streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus. A comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 English herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower level of infection was reached than in the 399 Danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. The annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at D.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of D.kr. 42 million on account of the Danish mastitis control. The total annual expenditure on Danish mastitis control is estimated at D.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million D.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.
TI  - The effects of chemotherapeutics on the species streptococcus in vitro.
AB  - The authors studied the sensitivity of some rather recent products--flucloxacillin, doxycyclin, clindamycin and cotrimoxazol--in correlation with classical penicillin. If therapy by means of classical penicillins is unsuitable, clindamycin and the semi-synthetic penicillin flucloxacillin appear to be a further alternative and the most suitable chemotherapeutic in streptococcal infections.

TI  - Cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group D streptococci.
AB  - A long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group D streptococci that were examined, five strains of Streptococcus faecalis, single strains of S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and S. durans, and three strains of Streptococcus spp. In one strain of S. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. The core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. It resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the S. faecalis strains. Cores were not present in single strains of S. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group A), S. agalactiae (group B), S. dysgalactiae (group C), S. equisimilis (group C), and S. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus megaterium. Cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group D streptococci. For preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.
