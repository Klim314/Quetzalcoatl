TI  == combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods for the determination of lactic microbiota in sucuk.
AB  == in this study, the culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods were used for the identification of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in sucuk a turkish fermented dry sausage. on the one hand, the pcr-dgge method targetting the v1 and v3 regions of 16s dna was applied to dna that was directly extracted from sucuk samples. on the other hand, rep-pcr fingerprinting was performed for the primary  differentiation and grouping of the isolates, and the results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rdna and 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer region. as a result of the pcr-dgge analysis of all the samples, total 8 different lactic acid bacteria were identified, and lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus and weissella viridescens were the dominant microbiota among these bacteria. the culture-dependent approach indicated that the majority of the strains belonged to the lactobacillus genera including lb. sakei, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. curvatus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus farciminis and lactobacillus alimentarius. however, leuconostoc and weisella were also detected as minor genera. again, lactococcus piscium, weissella halotolerans, staphylococcus succinus and the comigrated staphylococcus piscifermentans/staphylococcus condimenti/staphylococcus carnosus group were detected only with the culture-independent method while lb. plantarum, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc citreum were identified only by using the culture-dependent method. in the results, it was concluded that the combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent methods was necessary for reliable and detailed investigation of lab communities in fermented food products.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in suan-tsai and fu-tsai, traditional fermented mustard products of taiwan.
AB  == fu-tsai and suan-tsai are spontaneously fermented mustard products traditionally  prepared by the hakka tribe of taiwan. we chose 5 different processing stages of  these products for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (lab) by 16s rrna gene sequencing. from 500 lab isolates we identified 119 representative strains belonging to 5 genera and 18 species, including enterococcus (1 species), lactobacillus (11 species), leuconostoc (3 species), pediococcus (1 species), and weissella (2 species). the lab composition of mustard fermented for 3 days, known as the mu sample, was the most diverse, with  11 different lab species being isolated. we used sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene to identify the lab strains and analysis of the dnaa, phes, and rpoa genes to identify 13 lab strains for which identification by 16s rrna gene sequences was not possible. these 13 strains were found to belong to 5 validated  known species: lactobacillus farciminis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, weissella cibaria, and weissella paramesenteroides, and 5 possibly novel lactobacillus species. these results revealed that there is a high level of diversity in lab at the different stages of fermentation in the production of suan-tsai and fu-tsai.

TI  == characterisation of lab in typical salento pecorino cheese.
AB  == twenty-nine strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the typical pecorino cheese of the salento area of italy, were identified and grouped according to their genetic similarity. a preliminary characterisation of the strains was conducted by means of morphological and biochemical analysis, but molecular approaches were necessary for the clear identification of the species. for the species detection, the amplification and sequencing of the 16s rdna gene was employed in addition, restriction analysis of amplified rdna (ardra) and pcr and  aflp fingerprinting enabled inter- and intra-specific variation to be estimated upgma cluster analysis was used to divide the strains into distinct clusters which corresponded with the species delineation obtained by molecular identification. the data obtained show that the community of lactobacilli responsible for the fermentation and aging of pecorino cheese is composed of a limited number of species. the main identified strains were lactobacillus brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. sakei, l. pentosus, l. farciminis and leuconostoc mesenteroides.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.
