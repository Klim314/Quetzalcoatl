TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == distribution of genes encoding the microbial non-oxidative reversible hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases.
AB  == bacterial non-oxidative, reversible multi subunit hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases are encoded by the three clustered genes, b, c, and d, of approximately 0.6, 1.4, and 0.2 kb, respectively. there are more than 160 homologues in the database with significant similarity to gene b (homology to ubix) and c (ubid) distributed in all three microbial domains, however, homologues to gene d, are not numerous ( approximately 15). the occurrence of the entire bcd gene cluster encoding for either identified or presumptive hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase to date has been revealed in sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus (unique genes arrangement cdb), streptomyces sp. d7, bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, e. coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae,  enterobacter cloacae, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella enterica, s. paratyphi, s. typhimurium, s. bongori, and s. diarizonae. the corresponding genes from s. hydroxybenzoicus, b. subtilis, streptomyces sp. d7, e. coli o157:h7, k. pneumoniae, and s. typhimurium were cloned and expressed in e. coli dh5alpha (void of analogous genes), and shown to code for proteins exhibiting non-oxidative hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase activity.

TI  == isolation, characterization, and u(vi)-reducing potential of a facultatively anaerobic, acid-resistant bacterium from low-ph, nitrate- and u(vi)-contaminated  subsurface sediment and description of salmonella subterranea sp. nov.
AB  == a facultatively anaerobic, acid-resistant bacterium, designated strain frcl, was  isolated from a low-ph, nitrate- and u(vi)-contaminated subsurface sediment at site fw-024 at the natural and accelerated bioremediation research field research center in oak ridge, tenn. strain frcl was enriched at ph 4.5 in minimal medium with nitrate as the electron acceptor, hydrogen as the electron donor, and acetate as the carbon source. clones with 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences identical to the sequence of strain frcl were also detected in a u(vi)-reducing enrichment culture derived from the same sediment. cells of strain frcl were gram-negative motile regular rods 2.0 to 3.4 micro m long and 0.7 to 0.9 microm in diameter. strain frcl was positive for indole production, by the methyl red test, and for ornithine decarboxylase; it was negative by the voges-proskauer test (for acetylmethylcarbinol production), for urea hydrolysis, for arginine dihydrolase, for lysine decarboxylase, for phenylalanine deaminase, for h(2)s production, and for gelatin hydrolysis. strain frcl was capable of using o(2), no(3)(-), s(2)o(3)(2-), fumarate, and malate as terminal electron acceptors and of reducing u(vi) in the cell suspension. analysis of the 16s rdna sequence of the isolate indicated that this strain was 96.4% similar to salmonella bongori and 96.3% similar to enterobacter cloacae. physiological and phylogenetic analyses suggested that strain frcl belongs to the genus salmonella and represents a new species, salmonella subterranea sp. nov.
