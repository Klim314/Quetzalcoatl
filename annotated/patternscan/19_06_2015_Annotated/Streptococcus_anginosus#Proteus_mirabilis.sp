TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of abrus precatorius (l) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. method: in this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, three clinical s. aureus isolates from different sources, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus anginosus (s.milleri), bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. to measure the mic values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. result: at the  different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an mic of 8 ug/ml for  the leaf extract. extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of  the gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans but not against s anginosus, e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. the ph of the extracts ranged between ph5 and ph8. this study demonstrates that abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. conclusion: the results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of abrus precatorius for the treatment of  various bacteria-related diseases. topical application of abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  == the physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. this prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1) and/or u. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) ccu ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. in standard aerobic cultures, gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered,  high (> or =10(4) ccu ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) ccu ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. this study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of u. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for u. urealyticum should be raised to >  or =10(4) cfu ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before  any treatment.

TI  == [four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene with diabetes mellitus].
AB  == we report four cases of non-clostridial gas gangrene. all cases were associated with diabetes mellitus as the underlying disease. case 1: a 60-year-old male developed an ulcerative lesion on the dorsum of his left foot. peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, citrobacter freundii and staphyrococcus epidermidis were identified in culture from odoriferous pus. case 2: a 81-year-old female developed a lesion on her vulva spreading to the right lower abdomen. bacteroides bivius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and streptococcus faecalis were identified in culture of the odoriferous pus. case 3: a 80-year-old male developed a swollen area with ulcer on the right foot. bacteroides fragiris, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis were identified by culture. case 4: a 52-year-old female developed swelling of her left groin. enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus anginosus were identified in culture from the odoriferous pus. in all patients, a radiological examination revealed the presence of subcutaneous gas in the lesion. prognosis of non-clostridial gas gangrene is usually poor. these four patients, however, all survived. once an infectious sign is seen in the diabetic patient, it is important to discover a gas figure by using the radiological examination (plain film or computed tomography). earlier diagnosis and debridement are the most important for a better prognosis. because workers with diabetes mellitus are now increasing in number, occupational physicians should always keep in mind that a serious infectious disease like non-clostridial gas gangrene can develop even from minor accidental trauma, and they should control the working environment in  the workplace where accidents often happen.
