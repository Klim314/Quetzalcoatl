TI  == bacterial colonization in suspected sexually abused children.
AB  == objective: previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. the aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. methods: data were collected from 1996 to 2006. medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range  1-16, sd 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. spss software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. results: only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. sexually transmitted diseases were documented: gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and hiv 0 (0%, 27 tested). bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), streptococcus group b 8 (6.6%),  staphylococcus koag neg. 37 (30.6%), staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), bacteroides 19 (15.7%), prevotella 24 (19.8%), klebsiella 4  (3.3%), corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). conclusions: sexually  transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms  (except for bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.

TI  == internal bacterial flora of solid uterine cervical cancer.
AB  == twenty-five patients with uterine cervical cancer (two cases stage o; four cases  stage ia; five cases stage ib; one case stage iia; ten cases stage iib; two cases stage iiia; one case stage iva) served as the subjects. the bacterial flora inside the cervical cancers was investigated using the optimal technique. there was mixed abnormal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in all subjects. the average number of bacterial species isolated from inside the cervical cancers was 6.3. the predominant bacteria isolated were the aerobes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis, and prevotella bivia. as the stages of cervical cancer progressed, g.  vaginalis, b. distasonis and p. bivia were detected at higher rates and higher counts than other bacteria. these findings suggest that there is a relationship between g. vaginalis, b. distasonis and p. bivia and the onset and growth of cervical cancer.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.
