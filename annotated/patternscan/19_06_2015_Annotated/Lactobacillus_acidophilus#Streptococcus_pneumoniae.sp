TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == construction and validation of a mcherry protein vector for promoter analysis in  lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. in this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pnz8048 to express the mcherry protein (prcr) to expand the usage of the mcherry protein for analysis of gene expression in lactobacillus. this vector is also able to replicate in streptococcus pneumoniae  and escherichia coli. the usage of prcr as a promoter probe was validated in lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin b expression. the results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbab gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the l. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the s. thermophilus sty-31 inducer bacterium.

TI  == characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB  == lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of  7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins,  amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen  pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == cellular and humoral systemic and mucosal immune responses stimulated in volunteers by an oral polybacterial immunomodulator "dentavax".
AB  == the oral polybacterial immunomodulator dentavax (d), composed of killed cells from klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates was created for  immunoprophylaxis and therapy of oral mucosa and parodont inflammations. the stimulating effect of the preparation was evaluated in twelve volunteers immunized for 10 consecutive days. on days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 49 after the last immunization peripheral blood (pb) lymphocyte subsets, t lymphocyte activation and pb phagocytic activity, were studied by flow cytometry. pb lymphocyte proliferative responses to pha, ril-2, lps and d were evaluated radiometrically.  the production of tnf-alpha in supernatants of in vitro stimulated lymphocytes and specific iga, igm and igg antibodies in serum and saliva was determined by elisa. ultrastructural morphologic changes in t and b lymphocyte populations were also investigated. although no significant changes in the levels of basic lymphocyte subsets were detected, the early/late (cd57+/cd57-) cd8 t effectors ratio was increased at the end of the studied period, as were the percentage of pha-responding (cd69+) t cells and pb phagocytizing cells. the most prominent lymphoprolipherative responses were measured upon costimulation with lps+d and pha+d on day 21. electron-microscopic studies demonstrated a significant effect of d on both t and b cell activity. tnf-alpha concentration increased progressively from day 7 till the end of the investigation. maximal concentrations were observed after stimulation with d and lps. an increased level of specific salivary and serum antibodies against the components of d was found,  with highest levels between days 7 and 21. specific secretory iga predominated in saliva as compared to igm and igg. our results demonstrate the stimulating effect of dentavax on pb lymphocyte functional activity and the specific humoral systemic and mucosal immunity.

TI  == functional and comparative genomic analyses of an operon involved in fructooligosaccharide utilization by lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic organism that displays the ability to use prebiotic compounds such as fructooligosaccharides (fos), which stimulate the growth of beneficial commensals in the gastrointestinal tract. however, little is known about the mechanisms and genes involved in fos utilization by lactobacillus species. analysis of the l. acidophilus ncfm genome revealed an msm locus composed of a transcriptional regulator of the laci family, a four-component atp-binding cassette (abc) transport system, a fructosidase, and a sucrose phosphorylase. transcriptional analysis of this operon demonstrated that gene expression was induced by sucrose and fos but not by glucose or fructose, suggesting some specificity for nonreadily fermentable sugars. additionally, expression was repressed by glucose but not by fructose, suggesting catabolite repression via two cre-like sequences identified in the promoter-operator region. insertional inactivation of the genes encoding the abc transporter substrate-binding protein and the fructosidase reduced the ability of the mutants to grow on fos. comparative analysis of gene architecture within this cluster revealed a high degree of synteny with operons in streptococcus mutans and streptococcus pneumoniae. however, the association between a fructosidase and an  abc transporter is unusual and may be specific to l. acidophilus. this is a description of a previously undescribed gene locus involved in transport and catabolism of fos compounds, which can promote competition of beneficial microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == ingested probiotics reduce nasal colonization with pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci).
AB  == background: as a bacterial reservoir, the nose may harbor potentially pathogenic  bacteria (ppb: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and haemophilus influenzae). in patients carrying ppb, antiseptic regimens could be crucial for infection control after major operations on or injuries of the head, nasal sinuses, or lungs. such regimens may also be important for diabetic patients and persons receiving hemodialysis, in intensive  care units, or with impaired immunity due to various other causes. objective: we  tested a possible effect of the ingestion of probiotics on the bacterial flora of the nose. design: in an open, prospective trial, 209 volunteers were randomly assigned to consume either a probiotic, fermented milk drink [65 ml with lactobacillus gg (atcc 53103), bifidobacterium sp b420, lactobacillus acidophilus 145, and streptococcus thermophilus; n = 108] or standard yogurt (180 g; n = 101) daily for 3 wk. nasal microbial flora were analyzed on days 1, 21, and 28. the microbial examination was blinded to the source of the samples. results: we found a significant reduction (19%; p < 0.001) in the occurrence of nasal ppb in the group who consumed the probiotic drink but not in the group who consumed yogurt.  the effect was mainly on gram-positive bacteria, which decreased significantly (p < 0.05). conclusions: the results indicate that regular intake of probiotics can  reduce ppb in the upper respiratory tract. the results also indicate a linkage of the lymphoid tissue between the gut and the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator 'dentavax' in a rabbit experimental model.
AB  == the immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator, dentavax (d), composed of killed cells from klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates, have been investigated on an experimental rabbit model. in this model, mixed suspensions of the above bacterial wild strains have been injected in six sides of oral mucosa. a long-lasting inflammation with the development of infiltrates and confluating abscesses has been observed. the influence of orally given dentavax on the course of the model infection as well as on the dynamics of the immune response has been studied. a two-fold decrease in the duration and severity of inflammatory reaction, confirmed by the histological findings, has been registered. in immunised animals, an activation of polymorphonuclear phagocytosis, together with stimulation of humoral systemic and mucosal immunity with synthesis of specific serum (predominantly, igg) and coproantibodies (predominantly, s-iga) determined  by elisa, has been found. the results obtained proved the strong immunostimulating and protective effects of the preparation d, which is meant for the prophylaxis and treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == deletion analysis of sucrose metabolic genes from a salmonella plasmid cloned in  escherichia coli k12.
AB  == the sucrose operon from pur400, a 78-kbp conjugative salmonella plasmid, was cloned in escherichia coli k12. the operon was located in a 5.7-kbp sali restriction fragment and was subcloned, in each of two possible orientations, using the expression vector puc18. the insert dna was restriction mapped and duplicate restriction sites in the insert and in the polylinker of the vector were used to create various deletions promoter distal in the operon sequence. additional deletions were made with the restriction exonuclease bal31. cells containing hybrid plasmids with specified deletions lacked the ability to transport sucrose or were constitutive for hydrolase and/or uptake activities. the scra (enzyme iiscr) and scrr (regulatory) genes resided within 2900-bp smai-sali dna fragment and were assigned the order scrb, scra, scrr. an amplified sucrose-inducible gene product, mr 68,000, was detected only in the membrane fraction from recombinant cells that contained plasmid with the intact operon sequence. this protein represented 11% of the total membrane protein and was resistant to extraction with 0.5 m sodium chloride, 2% triton x-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. the protein did not appear to be the product of either the scra, scrb, or scrr gene and may therefore represent a previously unidentified membrane-bound sucrose protein. a new gene, scrc, is proposed. in addition, the cloned 5.7-kbp sali and 2.5-kbp smai-sali dna fragments failed to hybridize to chromosomal dna from bacillus subtilis, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus acidophilus as well as to dna from a sucrose plasmid from salmonella tennessee. however, the probes showed weak homology with a 20-kbp ecori restriction fragment from klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == common individual antigenic determinants in five of eight balb-c iga myeloma proteins that bind phosphoryl choline.
AB  == eight iga myeloma proteins derived from independently induced plasma-cytomas in genetically similar inbred balb/c mice are functionally related by their binding  of phosphoryl choline-containing antigens (pneumococcus c polysaccharide or lactobacillus antigen). each protein resembles a single species of immunoglobulin in antibody. the proteins are characterized by highly sensitive myeloma-specific  antisera prepared by immunizing mice of other inbred strains with the balb/c myeloma proteins. individual or myeloma-specific determinants located on fab fragments were found on three of the proteins that were unique for that protein and did not react with any other iga protein among over 70 tested. remarkably, five of the proteins shared two common myeloma-specific determinants which were specific for this group of five proteins. these results suggest that the five functionally and genetically related proteins sharing the same myeloma-specific determinants might also be structurally similar.
