TI  == reduction of phytate in soy drink by fermentation with lactobacillus casei expressing phytases from bifidobacteria.
AB  == plant-based food products can be modified by fermentation to improve flavour and  the concentration of some biologically active compounds, but also to increase the mineral availability by eliminating anti-nutrient substances such as phytates. the objective of this study was to develop a fermented soybean drink with improved nutritional quality and source of probiotic bacteria by including as starter for fermentation lactobacillus casei strains modified to produce phytase  enzymes from bifidobacteria. the l. casei strains showed a good adaptation to develop in the soy drink but they needed the addition of external carbohydrates to give rise to an efficient acidification. the strain expressing the bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum phytase was able to degrade more than 90 % phytate during product fermentation, whereas expression of bifidobacterium longum spp. infantis phytase only led to 65 % hydrolysis. in both cases, accumulation of myo-inositol triphosphates was observed. in addition, the hydrolysis of phytate in soy drink fermented with the l. casei strain expressing the b. pseudocatenulatum phytase resulted in phytate/mineral ratios for fe (0.35) and zn (2.4), which were below the critical values for reduced mineral bioavailability in humans. this investigation showed the ability of modified l. casei to produce  enzymes with technological relevance in the design of new functional foods.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == improved cloning vectors for bifidobacteria, based on the bifidobacterium catenulatum pbc1 replicon.
AB  == this study reports the development of several cloning vectors for bifidobacteria  based on the replicon of pbc1, a cryptic plasmid from bifidobacterium catenulatum l48 thought to replicate via the theta mode. these vectors, in which antibiotic resistance genes encoding either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance acted as selection markers, were able to replicate in a series of eight bifidobacterium species at frequencies ranging from 4.0 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(5) transformants microg(-1) but not in lactococcus lactis or lactobacillus casei. they showed a relative copy number of around 30 molecules per chromosome equivalent and a good  segregational stability, with more than 95% of the cells retaining the vectors after 80 to 100 generations in the absence of selection. vectors contain multiple cloning sites of different lengths, and the laczalpha peptide gene was introduced into one of the molecules, thus allowing the easy selection of colonies harboring recombinant plasmids in escherichia coli. the functionality of the vectors for engineering bifidobacterium strains was assessed by cloning and examining the expression of an alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase gene belonging to bifidobacterium longum. e. coli and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum recombinant clones were stable and showed an increase in alpha-arabinofuranosidase activity of over 100-fold compared to that of the untransformed hosts.
