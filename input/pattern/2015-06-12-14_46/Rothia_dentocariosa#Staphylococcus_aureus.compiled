TI  - Inhibition of microbial adhesion to silicone rubber treated with biosurfactant from Streptococcus thermophilus A.
AB  - Microbial adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber before and after conditioning with a biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus A was investigated in a parallel plate flow chamber. The silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was characterized using contact angle measurements. Water contact angles indicated that the silicone rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (58 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). The results obtained showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates, and the number of bacterial cells adhering after 4 h, for all microorganisms tested. A decrease in the initial deposition rate was observed for Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 52/2B and Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 from 1937+/-194 to 179+/-21 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1) and from 1255+/-54 to 233+/-26 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), respectively, accounting for an 86% reduction of the initial deposition rate for both strains. The number of bacterial cells adhering to the silicone rubber with preadsorbed biosurfactant after 4 h was further reduced by 89% and 97% by the two strains, respectively. The two yeast strains tested showed less reduction in adhesion after 4 h, to values between 67% and 70%. Such a pretreatment with surface-active compounds may constitute a promising strategy to reduce the microbial colonization rate of silicone rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - Biosurfactant from Lactococcus lactis 53 inhibits microbial adhesion on silicone  rubber.
AB  - The ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium Lactococcus lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. Water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). The results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6 from 2,100 to 220 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), and Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. The deposition rates of Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 52/2B, Candida albicans GBJ 13/4A, and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant as compared with the other strains. This study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone-rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - Influence of different combinations of bacteria and yeasts in voice prosthesis biofilms on air flow resistance.
AB  - Laryngectomized patients use silicone rubber voice prostheses to rehabilitate their voice. However, biofilm formation limits the lifetime of voice prostheses. The presence of particular combinations of bacterial and yeast strains in voice prosthesis biofilms has been suggested to be crucial for causing valve failure. In order to identify combinations of bacterial and yeast strains causative to failure of voice prostheses, the effects of various combinations of bacterial and yeast strains on air flow resistances of Groningen button voice prostheses were determined. Biofilms were grown on Groningen button voice prostheses by inoculating so-called artificial throats with various combinations of clinically relevant bacterial and yeast strains. After 3 days, all throats were perfused three times daily with 250 ml phosphate buffered saline and at the end of each day the artificial throats were filled with growth medium for half an hour. After 7 days, the air flow resistances of the prostheses were measured. These air flow resistances were expressed relative to the air flow resistances of the same prostheses prior to biofilm formation. This study shows that biofilms causing strong increases in air flow resistance (26 to 28 cm water x s/l) comprised combinations of microorganisms, involving Candida tropicalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Rothia dentocariosa.
TI  - Adhesive interactions between voice prosthetic yeast and bacteria on silicone rubber in the absence and presence of saliva.
AB  - Biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses are the major cause for frequent failure and replacement of these devices. The presence of both bacterial strains and yeast has been suggested to be crucial for the development of voice prosthetic biofilms. Adhesive interactions between Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Candida tropicalis with 14 bacterial strains, all isolated from explanted voice prostheses were investigated in a parallel plate flow chamber. Bacteria were first allowed to adhere to silicone rubber, after which the flow chamber was perfused with yeast, suspended either in saliva or buffer. Generally, when yeast were adhering from buffer and saliva, the presence of adhering bacteria suppressed adhesion of yeast. In saliva, Rothia dentocariosa and Staphylococcus aureus enhanced adhesion of yeast, especially of C. albicans. This study shows that bacterial adhesion mostly reduces subsequent adhesion of yeast, while only a few bacterial strains stimulate adhesion of yeast, provided salivary adhesion mediators are present. Interestingly, different clinical studies have identified R. dentocariosa and S. aureus in biofilms on explanted prostheses of patients needing most frequent replacement, while C. albicans is one of the yeast generally held responsible for silicone rubber deterioration.
TI  - Air-flow resistances of silicone rubber voice prostheses after formation of bacterial and fungal biofilms.
AB  - Laryngectomized patients use silicone rubber voice prostheses to rehabilitate their voice. However, biofilm formation limits the lifetime of voice prostheses by causing leakage or an increased air-flow resistance and the prosthesis has to be replaced. To determine which bacterial or yeast strains, isolated from explanted voice prostheses, contribute most to increases in air-flow resistance of silicone rubber voice prostheses, biofilms consisting of either a bacterial or a yeast strain were grown on voice prostheses in the artificial throat model. The effects of these biofilms on air-flow resistances were determined by calculating the difference in air-flow resistance of the individual voice prosthesis as covered with a 7-day-old biofilm with the situation prior to biofilm formation. Conspicuously, voice prosthetic biofilms formed by the bacterial strains Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 and Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 41/25B and their excreted organic matter showed larger increases in air-flow resistance (more then 30 cm H(2)O.s/L) than biofilms formed by Candida species. This is contrary to the literature, where there seems to be agreement that Candida species are mainly responsible for clinical failure of silicone rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of synthetic salivary peptides against voice prosthetic microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether synthetic salivary antimicrobial peptides have an inhibitory effect on the growth of bacteria and yeasts isolated from used silicone rubber voice prostheses. METHODS: The antimicrobial activities of six synthetic salivary peptides (histatin 5, dhvarl, dhvar4, dhvar5, lactoferrin b 1730 [LFb 17-30], and cystatin S1-15) at concentrations of 2 and 4 mg/mL were determined against different oropharyngeal yeast (four) and bacterial (eight) strains and against a "total microflora" isolated from explanted voice prostheses using agar diffusion tests. The spectrum of susceptible microorganisms was determined qualitatively. RESULTS: Histatin 5 and cystatin S1-15 did not show any antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms involved in this study. Dhvar1 was active against some of the oropharyngeal microorganisms tested, including the yeast strains, but not against Rothia dentocariosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and the total microflora Dhvar4 was active against all microorganisms tested, including the total microflora. Dhvar5 lacked activity against E coli and the total microflora LFb 1730 did not inhibit the growth of any of the yeast strains involved and showed only minor activity against some of the bacterial strains. LFb 1730 slightly inhibited the growth of the total microflora from an explanted prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The synthetic salivary peptide dhvar4 has a broad antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms that are commonly isolated from explanted voice prostheses, including yeasts. Therewith, it may represent a useful drug, as an alternative for antibiotics and antimycotics employed in various ways to prolong the lifetime of voice prostheses in laryngectomees.
