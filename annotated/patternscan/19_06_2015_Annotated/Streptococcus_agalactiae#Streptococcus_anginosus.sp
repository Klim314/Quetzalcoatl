TI  == surrogate analysis of vancomycin to predict susceptible categorization of dalbavancin.
AB  == dalbavancin (dal) represents a recently approved addition for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssis). newly released antimicrobial agents are rarely found on commercial susceptibility testing devices, and surrogate testing may be an option for clinical microbiology laboratories. a total of 33,688 staphylococcus aureus, 2800 viridans group streptococci (vgs), and 5722 beta-hemolytic streptococci (bhs) were included in this cross-susceptibility (dal versus vancomycin [van]) analysis as well as 4576  coagulase-negative staphylococci and 6515 enterococci (nonindicated species groups). isolates were collected as part of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program for the united states (usa) and europe (2011-2013). susceptibility testing followed clsi (m07-a9 and m100-s24) methods. usa food and drug administration (dal) and clsi (van) breakpoint criteria were used for correlations between dal and van susceptibility results. a categorical agreement  (ca; susceptible) rate of 99.9% was observed between dal and van when testing s.  aureus. only 48 (0.14%) very major (false-susceptible) errors were noted against  van-susceptible isolates that displayed a dal-nonsusceptible (mic, 0.25 or 0.5mug/ml) phenotype. when susceptible mic correlations were analyzed against indicated bhs species (streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes), an overall ca rate of 97.7-100.0% was obtained. complete (100.0%) ca was documented  for s. pyogenes, as well as against all vgs isolates, including the indicated streptococcus anginosus group (758 strains). in conclusion, high susceptible ca rates between dal and van were observed when testing a contemporary collection of indicated clinical isolates found in absssi. van-susceptible isolates can be inferred to be inhibited by dal (97.7-100.0%) at the regulatory agency-approved susceptible interpretive breakpoint of </=0.12mug/ml.

TI  == activity of oritavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in european and us hospitals (2010-13).
AB  == objectives: to assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis) in european and us hospitals. methods: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for sstis were included. isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in europe (israel included) and the usa, respectively, between 2010  and 2013. results: oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal mic, mic50 and mic90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus. cons from the usa (mic50, 0.015 mg/l) demonstrated an mic50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from europe (mic50, 0.03 mg/l). overall, vancomycin-resistant (vana-phenotype) enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin mics  (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (mic50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/l; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all vana e. faecalis at </=0.5  mg/l. equivalent oritavancin mics (mic50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/l) were noted for all vanb and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, while higher mics (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l) were obtained for vana strains. oritavancin had low mics against the overall populations of streptococcus pyogenes (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the streptococcus anginosus group (mic50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher mics for streptococcus dysgalactiae (mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/l; >/=98.3% susceptible). conclusions: oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of european and us isolates causing sstis. these results describe oritavancin activity against gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the usa.

TI  == vang element insertions within a conserved chromosomal site conferring vancomycin resistance to streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == three vancomycin-resistant streptococcal strains carrying vang elements (two invasive streptococcus agalactiae isolates [gbs-ny and gbs-nm, both serotype ii and multilocus sequence type 22] and one streptococcus anginosus [sa]) were examined. the 45,585-bp elements found within sa and gbs-ny were nearly identical (together designated vang-1) and shared near-identity over an ~15-kb overlap with a previously described vang element from enterococcus faecalis. unexpectedly, vang-1 shared much less homology with the 49,321-bp vang-2 element from gbs-nm, with widely different levels (50% to 99%) of sequence identity shared among 44 related open reading frames. immediately adjacent to both vang-1 and vang-2 were  44,670-bp and 44,680-bp integrative conjugative element (ice)-like sequences, designated ice-r, that were nearly identical in the two group b streptococcal (gbs) strains. the dual vang and ice-r elements from both gbs strains were inserted at the same position, between bases 1328 and 1329, within the identical  rna methyltransferase (ruma) genes. a genbank search revealed that although most  gbs strains contained insertions within this specific site, only sequence type 22 (st22) gbs strains contained highly related ice-r derivatives. the vang-1 element in sa was also inserted within this position corresponding to its ruma homolog adjacent to an ice-r derivative. vang-1 insertions were previously reported within the same relative position in the e. faecalis ruma homolog. an ice-r sequence perfectly conserved with respect to its counterpart in gbs-ny was apparent within the same site of the ruma homolog of a streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain. additionally, homologous vang-like elements within the conserved ruma target site were evident in roseburia intestinalis. importance: these three streptococcal strains represent the first known vancomycin-resistant  strains of their species. the collective observations made from these strains reveal a specific hot spot for insertional elements that is conserved between streptococci and different gram-positive species. the two gbs strains potentially represent a gbs lineage that is predisposed to insertion of vang elements.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == lincosamide resistance mediated by lnu(c) (l phenotype) in a streptococcus anginosus clinical isolate.
AB  == objectives: unique resistance to lincosamides (l phenotype) due to the production of nucleotidyltransferases (lnu) is uncommon among gram-positive bacteria. the aim of the study was to characterize the l phenotype in a clinical isolate of the streptococcus milleri group. methods: the strain ucn93 was recovered from neonatal specimens and from the mother's vaginal swab. identification was confirmed by sequencing of the soda gene. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the disc diffusion method, while mics were determined using the agar dilution method. screening for lnu(a), lnu(b), lnu(c) and lnu(d) genes was performed by pcr. genetic environment and support were determined by thermal  asymmetric interlaced pcr and pcr mapping. the transfer of lincomycin resistance  was also attempted by conjugation. results: ucn93 was unambiguously identified as streptococcus anginosus. it was susceptible to all tested antibiotics, except lincomycin (mic, 8 mg/l) and tetracycline (2 mg/l). the lnu(c) gene was found to  be responsible for the l phenotype. it was shown that lnu(c) was associated with  a gene coding for a transposase within a structure similar to the transposon mtnsag1, described once in streptococcus agalactiae. since mtnsag1 was found to be mobilized by tn916 and s. anginosus ucn93 harboured a tn916 transposon, several attempts at transfer were performed but they all failed. the lnu(c)-containing genetic element was inserted into a chromosomal intergenic sequence of s. anginosus. conclusions: since lnu(c) has been detected in only one s. agalactiae clinical isolate so far, this is its second description among clinically relevant streptococci.

TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.

TI  == organization of the capsule biosynthesis gene locus of the oral streptococcus streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == the capsular polysaccharide (cps) of the important oral streptococcus streptococcus anginosus, which causes endocarditis, and the genes for its synthesis have not been clarified. in this study, we investigated the gene locus  required for cps synthesis in s. anginosus. southern hybridization using the cpse gene of the well-characterized bacterium s. agalactiae revealed that there is a similar gene in the genome of s. anginosus. by using the colony hybridization technique and inverse pcr, we isolated the cps synthesis (cps) genes of s. anginosus. this gene cluster consisted of genes containing typical regulatory genes, cpsa-d, and glycosyltransferase genes coding for glucose, rhamnose, n-acetylgalactosamine, and galactofuranose transferases. furthermore, we confirmed that the cps locus is required for cps synthesis using a mutant strain  with a defective cpse gene. the cps cluster was found to be located downstream the nrdg gene, which encodes ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase activator, as  is the case in other oral streptococci such as s. gordonii and s. sanguinis. however, the location of the gene cluster was different from those of s. pneumonia and s. agalactiae.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == intrauterine infection and spontaneous midgestation abortion: is the spectrum of  microorganisms similar to that in preterm labor?
AB  == objective: to determine whether microorganisms associated with intrauterine infection and preterm labor play a contributing role in midgestation abortion. methods: a 4 year retrospective review of spontaneous midgestation abortions for  which autopsy and microbiological cultures of placental and fetal tissue were performed was conducted for a tertiary obstetrics hospital, which included a regional referral service for perinatal and fetal pathology. one hundred twenty-nine spontaneously delivered, nonmacerated, midgestation fetuses or stillbirths (of between 16 and 26 weeks' gestation) and placentas were examined and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, and genital mycoplasmas. results: microorganisms were recovered in 85 (66%) cases (57% placentas, 49% fetuses). among the culture positive cases, 81% had histological chorioamnionitis, 28% fetal pneumonitis, 38% clinical signs of infection, and 62% ruptured membranes at the time of miscarriage. these differed significantly from  culture-negative cases (44%, 5%, 13%, and 34%, respectively). group b streptococcus (gbs) was the most significant pathogen, recovered in 21 cases, 13  as the sole isolate, 94% with chorioamnionitis, and 47% in women with intact membranes. escherichia coli and ureaplasma urealyticum (22 and 24 cases, respectively) occurred mostly as mixed infections, with ruptured membranes. gbs,  mu urealyticum, and streptococcus anginosus group were individually associated with chorioamnionitis, bacteroides/prevotella and s. anginosus with fetal pneumonitis. the spectrum of microorganisms was similar to that in preterm labor  at later gestations; however, gbs appeared to be the most significant pathogen in midgestation miscarriage, especially with intact membranes. conclusions: unsuspected intrauterine infection underlies many spontaneous midgestation abortions. gbs is a key pathogen in this setting.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

AB  == the 16s-23s rna gene intergenic spacers of isolates of streptococcus equi (n = 5), s. zooepidemicus (n = 5), s. equisimilis (n = 3) and s. dysgalactiae (n = 2)  were sequenced and compared. there were distinct regions within the spacer, arranged in the order 1-9 for all s. equi and one s. zooepidemicus isolate and 1,2 and 4-9 for the remaining isolates. region 4 was identical to the trna(ala) gene found in the 16s-23s intergenic spacers of other streptococci. regions 1, 5, 6 and 7 had distinct variations, each conserved in different isolates. however, amongst the intergenic spacers there were different combinations of variant regions, suggesting a role for dna recombination in their evolution. the intergenic spacer of all isolates of s. equi and one s. zooepidemicus isolate were almost identical. primers derived from the variant sequences of regions 1 and 5 to 6 were used to group all s. zooepidemicus (n = 17) and s. equi (n = 5) into 1 of 8 types by polymerase chain reaction; three s. zooepidemicus isolates typed the same as s. equi. s. equi and s. zooepidemicus were clearly distinguishable from s. equisimilis and s. dysgalactiae which had shorter regions 5 and 6 and no region 7. most homology for the group c sequences was found in previously published sequences for the 16s-23s intergenic spacers of s. anginosis, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. salivarius and s. agalactiae. a 75-90 nucleotide length shared with s. anginosus and s. intermedius in opposite orientations in the two main variants of region 6 supported the role for dna recombination in the evolution of the spacer. the 16s-23s intergenic spacers indicate that s. zooepidemicus was the archetypal species for s. equi and that both are genetically more distant from s. equisimilis and s. dysgalactiae. the intergenic spacer can be used to identify specifically the group c streptococci and as an epidemiological marker for s. zooepidemicus.

TI  == the microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  == basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of streptococcaceae are given. identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, lancefield group c and g streptococci, s. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (lancefield grouping). rapid antigen tests for the detection of group a and b streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. the reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. the elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group a and b streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and  molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. recently employed examples include the  m protein gene typing of group a streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of pcr assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial dna in association with dna fragment separation by conventional or pfge have been applied successfully to several species of streptococcaceae (e.g., s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae). enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe  underlying disease. molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. e. faecalis and e. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal  species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. the definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. the increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. all enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in e. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == infectious arthritis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == eleven cases of infectious arthritis occurring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are reported. staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in eight patients. streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus agalactiae in one patient each, and mycobacterium tuberculosis in two patients. the mean duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 16 days in patients with pyogenic arthritis. the diagnosis of joint infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis was especially  delayed (57 days). four patients died; they were found to have a longer time to diagnosis and two of them had multiple joint infection. although staphylococcus aureus is the microorganism most often affecting patients with rheumatoid arthritis, infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis must also be considered in such patients.

TI  == intrageneric structure of streptococcus based on comparative analysis of small-subunit rrna sequences.
AB  == the partial 16s rrna sequences of 24 streptococcus species were determined by reverse transcription. a comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of seven previously studied streptococcal species revealed the presence of several clusters within the genus. the clusters obtained from the sequence analysis agreed in general with the groups outlined on the basis of the results of nucleic acid hybridization studies, but there were some exceptions. the pyogenic group was extended to include streptococcus agalactiae, s. parauberis, s. porcinus, and s. uberis. four oral groups were discerned; these four groups centered on s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, and s. oralis. some species (e.g., s. suis and s. acidominimus) did not cluster with any particular group. our findings are discussed in the context of data from other genetic and chemotaxonomic studies.

TI  == cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  == cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to escherichia coli (two bacteremic), pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae, or streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were  clinically cured, but one relapse (s. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. six patients with cystitis due to e. coli, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, p. aeruginosa, or s. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both,  occurred in five due to p. aeruginosa, s. faecalis, c. fruendii, or e. coli. neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to hemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, or neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but p. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. eight soft tissue infections due to staphylococcus aureus, peptococcus prevotti,  streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to s. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for s. aureus occurred in one. granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. possible side effects require further study.
