TI  == intramolecular clasp of the cellulosomal ruminococcus flavefaciens scaa dockerin  module confers structural stability.
AB  == the cellulosome is a large extracellular multi-enzyme complex that facilitates the efficient hydrolysis and degradation of crystalline cellulosic substrates. during the course of our studies on the cellulosome of the rumen bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens, we focused on the critical scaa dockerin (scaadoc), the unique dockerin that incorporates the primary enzyme-integrating scaa scaffoldin into the cohesin-bearing scab adaptor scaffoldin. in the absence of a  high-resolution structure of the scaadoc module, we generated a computational model, and, upon its analysis, we were surprised to discover a putative stacking  interaction between an n-terminal trp and a c-terminal pro, which we termed intramolecular clasp. in order to verify the existence of such an interaction, these residues were mutated to alanine. circular dichroism spectroscopy, intrinsic tryptophan and ans fluorescence, and nmr spectroscopy indicated that mutation of these residues has a destabilizing effect on the functional integrity of the ca(2+)-bound form of scaadoc. analysis of recently determined dockerin structures from other species revealed the presence of other well-defined intramolecular clasps, which consist of different types of interactions between selected residues at the dockerin termini. we propose that this thematic interaction may represent a major distinctive structural feature of the dockerin  module.

TI  == surface display of a functional minicellulosome by intracellular complementation  using a synthetic yeast consortium and its application to cellulose hydrolysis and ethanol production.
AB  == in this paper, we report the surface assembly of a functional minicellulosome by  using a synthetic yeast consortium. the basic design of the consortium consisted  of four different engineered yeast strains capable of either displaying a trifunctional scaffoldin, scaf-ctf (sc), carrying three divergent cohesin domains from clostridium thermocellum (t), clostridium cellulolyticum (c), and ruminococcus flavefaciens (f), or secreting one of the three corresponding dockerin-tagged cellulases (endoglucanase [at], exoglucanase [ec/cb], or beta-glucosidase [bf]). the secreted cellulases were docked onto the displayed scaf-ctf in a highly organized manner based on the specific interaction of the three cohesin-dockerin pairs employed, resulting in the assembly of a functional  minicellulosome on the yeast surface. by exploiting the modular nature of each population to provide a unique building block for the minicellulosome structure,  the overall cellulosome assembly, cellulose hydrolysis, and ethanol production were easily fine-tuned by adjusting the ratio of different populations in the consortium. the optimized consortium consisted of a sc:at:cb:bf ratio of 7:2:4:2  and produced almost twice the level of ethanol (1.87 g/liter) as a consortium with an equal ratio of the different populations. the final ethanol yield of 0.475 g of ethanol/g of cellulose consumed also corresponded to 93% of the theoretical value. this result confirms the use of a synthetic biology approach for the synergistic saccharification and fermentation of cellulose to ethanol by  using a yeast consortium displaying a functional minicellulosome.

TI  == functional assembly of minicellulosomes on the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface for cellulose hydrolysis and ethanol production.
AB  == we demonstrated the functional display of a miniscaffoldin on the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface consisting of three divergent cohesin domains from clostridium thermocellum (t), clostridium cellulolyticum (c), and ruminococcus flavefaciens (f). incubation with escherichia coli lysates containing an endoglucanase (cela) fused with a dockerin domain from c. thermocellum (at), an exoglucanase (cele) from c. cellulolyticum fused with a dockerin domain from the  same species (ec), and an endoglucanase (celg) from c. cellulolyticum fused with  a dockerin domain from r. flavefaciens (gf) resulted in the assembly of a functional minicellulosome on the yeast cell surface. the displayed minicellulosome retained the synergistic effect for cellulose hydrolysis. when a  beta-glucosidase (bgla) from c. thermocellum tagged with the dockerin from r. flavefaciens was used in place of gf, cells displaying the new minicellulosome exhibited significantly enhanced glucose liberation and produced ethanol directly from phosphoric acid-swollen cellulose. the final ethanol concentration of 3.5 g/liter was 2.6-fold higher than that obtained by using the same amounts of added purified cellulases. the overall yield was 0.49 g of ethanol produced per g of carbohydrate consumed, which corresponds to 95% of the theoretical value. this result confirms that simultaneous and synergistic saccharification and fermentation of cellulose to ethanol can be efficiently accomplished with a yeast strain displaying a functional minicellulosome containing all three required cellulolytic enzymes.

TI  == unravelling carbon metabolism in anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria.
AB  == carbon metabolism in anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria has been investigated essentially in clostridium thermocellum, clostridium cellulolyticum, fibrobacter  succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and ruminococcus albus. while cellulose  depolymerization into soluble sugars by various cellulases is undoubtedly the first step in bacterial metabolisation of cellulose, it is not the only one to consider. among anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria, c. cellulolyticum has been investigated metabolically the most in the past few years. summarizing metabolic  flux analyses in continuous culture using either cellobiose (a soluble cellodextrin resulting from cellulose hydrolysis) or cellulose (an insoluble biopolymer), this review aims to stress the importance of the insoluble nature of a carbon source on bacterial metabolism. furthermore, some general and specific traits of anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria trends, namely, the importance and benefits of (i) cellodextrins with degree of polymerization higher than 2, (ii) intracellular phosphorolytic cleavage, (iii) glycogen cycling on cell bioenergetics, and (iv) carbon overflows in regulation of carbon metabolism, as well as detrimental effects of (i) soluble sugars and (ii) acidic environment on  bacterial growth. future directions for improving bacterial cellulose degradation are discussed.
