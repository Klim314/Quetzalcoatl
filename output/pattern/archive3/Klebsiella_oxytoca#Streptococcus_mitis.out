microbial inhibition of oral epithelial wound recovery: potential role for quorum sensing molecules?
awareness of the impact of microbiota in both health and disease is growing. using a new in vitro oral mucosa co-culture model, we recently showed a clear inhibition of epithelial wound healing in the presence of an oral microbial community. in this paper, we have used the same model in combination with specific oral microbial species to obtain a better insight into the role of the oral microbiota in wound healing. monocultures of klebsiella oxytoca and lactobacillus salivarius significantly inhibited wound healing with ~20%, whereas streptococcus mitis and s. oralis enhanced the healing process with ~15% in 24 h. yet, neither s. oralis or s. mitis were able to counteract the inhibitory effects from k. oxytoca on wound healing. other tested microbial species had no effect on wound healing. apart from this species-dependency, the inhibitory effect on wound healing depended on a microbial threshold concentration. further mechanistic experiments with k. oxytoca excluded different microbial factors and hypothesized that quorum sensing molecules might play a role in the inter-kingdom signalling during wound healing. these results are important for the development of new strategies for the management of (infected) wounds and ulcerations.
