TI  == composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts of some acinos miller species.
AB  == gc and gc/ms analyses of the methanol extracts obtained from the aerial parts of  six acinos miller species from serbia and montenegro were performed. seventy-four constituents, accounting for 84.9-99.0% of the total composition of the extracts, were identified. the common feature of the a. suaveolens, a. majoranifolius and a. alpinus methanol extracts was the high content of monoterpenes, while the common feature of the a. graveolens, a. arvensis and a. hungaricus methanol extracts was the prevalence of sesquiterpenes. the total flavonoids, polyphenols  and tannins content, as well as antioxidant activity (frap and dpph assay) of the methanolic extracts were investigated. the highest antioxidant activity was observed in the extract of a. alpinus which had high levels of all polyphenol classes examined. a disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of the extracts against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: bacillus subtilis, clostridium pyogenes, enterococcus sp., micrococcus flavus, sarcina lutea, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli; fungi: aspergillus niger, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae). the preliminary bioassay results indicated that the methanol extract of a. alpinus could be a possible source of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to chlorinated solvents.
AB  == the aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of four chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (cahs), perchloroethene (pce), carbon tetrachloride (ct),  chloroform (cf) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-dca), on the growth of eight anaerobic bacteria: four fermentative species (escherichia coli, klebsiella sp.,  clostridium sp. and paenibacillus sp.) and four respiring species (pseudomonas aeruginosa, geobacter sulfurreducens, shewanella oneidensis and desulfovibrio vulgaris). effective concentrations of solvents which inhibited growth rates by 50% (ec50) were determined. the octanol-water partition coefficient or log po/w of a cah proved a generally satisfactory measure of its toxicity. most species tolerated approximately 3-fold and 10-fold higher concentrations of the two relatively more polar cahs cf and 1,2-dca, respectively, than the two relatively  less polar compounds pce and ct. ec50 values correlated well with growth rates observed in solvent-free cultures, with fast-growing organisms displaying higher  tolerance levels. overall, fermentative bacteria were more tolerant to cahs than  respiring species, with iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in particular appearing highly sensitive to cahs. these data extend the current understanding of the impact of cahs on a range of anaerobic bacteria, which will benefit the field of bioremediation.

TI  == ph in the bacteria-contaminated wound and its impact on clostridium histolyticum  collagenase activity: implications for the use of collagenase wound debridement agents.
AB  == purpose: we sought to understand the influence of ph on clostridium collagenase activity, using both in vitro and in vivo, and to understand the influence of bacterial contamination on ph in vivo. design: artificial wound eschar was used for the assessment of debridement efficacy in vitro and the wound fluid of a contaminated pig wound model was used for examining ph during healing using in vivo techniques. methods: we used a collagen-based artificial wound eschar to test collagenase activity in the collagenase product under various ph conditions. we evaluated bacterial contaminated wounds, using a pig wound model with a bacterial load including pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and fusobacterium sp to track the ph of wounds in relation to bacterial load. results: the ph levels in the wound fluid were all above neutral. they varied from 9.2 on day 1 to 8.3 on day 10. collagenase achieved its highest  activity around a ph of 8.5 when tested in tris-buffered saline. using artificial wound eschar, the optimal ph range for c collagenase was determined to be more than a ph of 6. the total initial microbial load (day 0) was higher than levels at any other time during the study. the levels of p aeruginosa began to decrease  on day 1, but by day 4 the total pseudomonas population had rebounded to near day 0 levels. this was followed by a distinct decrease and by day 21 levels were lower than those on day 0. the coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) population  behaved differently than the pseudomonas population, decreasing and remaining decreased relative to day 0 through day 14. however, by day 21 the cns population had increased to near day 0 levels. this greatly influenced the increase in total bioburden by day 21, indicating that it was primarily due to the increase in cns. conclusion: the data demonstrate that wound ph in a model of contaminated pig wounds is alkaline during the first 10 days of healing. as healing progresses, ph decreases with no significant change in the level of bacterial bioburden. c collagenase exhibited robust activity in the ph range found in this contaminated  pig wound model, suggesting it can effectively debride necrotic tissue in the environment found in most chronic wounds in humans.

TI  == physical, chemical and microbiological quality of ice used to cool drinks and foods in greece and its public health implications.
AB  == ice used for direct human consumption or to preserve foods and cool down drinks can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and may potentially become a vehicle for consumer's infection. to evaluate physical, chemical and microbiological quality of commercial ice and ice used for fish and seafood, 100  ice samples collected at 10 different retail points in the region of epirus were  studied. the following microbiological parameters were determined: total coliforms, fecal coliforms, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia spp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., vibrio cholerae, aeromonas spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens. e. coli was detected in 22% and coliforms were detected in 31% of samples. samples in which coliforms were detected fail to meet the microbiological criteria specified by the drinking water legislation. aeromonas spp., shigella spp., campylobacter sp. and v. cholerae were not detected. spore forms of c. perfringens were prevalent at 35% and the psychotropic bacterium's p. aeruginosa and yersinia spp. were found only at three samples each. the presence of large numbers of coliforms as well as of other pathogenic strains suggested that commercial ice and ice used to make cool drinks or in preservation of fish and seafood may represent a potential hazard to the consumer. in view of the results reported herein, it is highly recommended that national regulatory guidelines should be established for the production of ice as long as regular inspections.

TI  == fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in crude oil contaminated wetland ultisol.
AB  == the effect of crude oil on the growth of legumes (calopogonium muconoides and centrosema pubescens) and fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in wetland ultisol was investigated using standard cultural techniques. the results revealed observable  effects of oil on soil physico-chemistry, plant growth and nodulation as well as  on densities of heterotrophic, hydrocarbonoclastic and nitrogen fixing bacteria.  the effects however varied with different levels (0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) of pollution. ammonium and nitrate levels were high in the unpolluted soil but decreased with increase in pollution levels. nitrite was not detected in contaminated soil probably due to the reduction in numbers of nitrogen fixers, from 5.26 +/- 0.23 x l0(6)cfu/g in unpolluted soil to 9.0 +/- 0.12 x 10(5) and 2.2 +/- 0.08 x l0(5) cfu/g in soils with 5% and 20% levels of pollution respectively. the contaminated soil also exhibited gross reduction in the nodulation of legumes. a range of 13-57 nodules was observed in legumes from polluted soil against 476 nodules recorded for plants cultured on unpolluted soil. the heterogeneity of the microbial loads between oil-polluted and unpolluted soil were statistically significant (p < 0.05, anova). positive significant relationships were observed between the levels of hydrocarbons and the densities of heterotrophic bacteria (r = 0.91) and that of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria (r = 0.86). on the other hand, relationships between the densities of nitrogen fixing bacteria and total hydrocarbons content was negative (r = -0.30) while positive relationships were recorded between the densities of different microbial groups and treatment periods except at 15% and 20% pollution  levels. the lsd tests revealed highly significant differences (p < 0.001) in the  physiological groups of soil microorganisms at all levels of pollution. the results imply that crude oil seriously affects rhizosphere microbial growth in legumes. among the bacterial species isolated, clostridium pasteurianum, bacillus polymyxa and pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited greater ability to degrade hydrocarbons than azotobacter sp, klebsiella pneumoniae and derxia gummusa while  nitrosomonas and nitrobacter had the least degradability. a continuous monitoring of the environment is advocated to prevent extinction of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and total loss of soil fertility attributable to petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in the niger delta ultisol.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the enniatin b, produced by fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on caco-2 cells.
AB  == the enniatins (ens) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of fusarium sp. the en b was purified from extracts of fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (pdb), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (lc) followed by an analytical lc.  the purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (esi-ms) study. the pure fraction of en b was utilized to determine  the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally  pathogens of the intestinal tract: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, salmonella enterica, shigella dysenteriae, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. the results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, en b induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms  tested and no significant differences over control were detected when caco-2 cells were exposed to en b, at any of the concentrations used.

TI  == tailor-made type ii pseudomonas pha synthases and their use for the biosynthesis  of polylactic acid and its copolymer in recombinant escherichia coli.
AB  == previously, we have developed metabolically engineered escherichia coli strains capable of producing polylactic acid (pla) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [p(3hb-co-la)] by employing evolved clostridium propionicum propionate coa transferase (pct(cp)) and pseudomonas sp. mbel 6-19 polyhydroxyalkanoate (pha) synthase 1 (phac1(ps6-19)). introduction of mutations four sites (e130, s325, s477, and q481) of phac1( ps6-19) have been found to affect the polymer content,  lactate mole fraction, and molecular weight of p(3hb-co-la). in this study, we have further engineered type ii pseudomonas pha synthases 1 (phac1s) from pseudomonas chlororaphis, pseudomonas sp. 61-3, pseudomonas putida kt2440, pseudomonas resinovorans, and pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 to accept short-chain-length hydroxyacyl-coas including lactyl-coa and 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa as substrates by site-directed mutagenesis of four sites (e130, s325, s477, and q481). all phac1s having mutations in these four sites were able to accept lactyl-coa as a substrate and supported the synthesis of p(3hb-co-la) in recombinant e. coli, whereas the wild-type phac1s could not accumulate polymers in detectable levels. the contents, lactate mole fractions, and the molecular weights of p(3hb-co-la) synthesized by recombinant e. coli varied depending upon  the source of the pha synthase and the mutants used. pla homopolymer could also be produced at ca. 7 wt.% by employing the several phac1 variants containing e130d/s325t/s477g/q481k quadruple mutations in wild-type e. coli xl1-blue.

TI  == uv disinfection of rbc-treated light greywater effluent: kinetics, survival and regrowth of selected microorganisms.
AB  == the microbial quality of raw greywater was found to be much better than that of municipal wastewater, with 1.6 x 10(7)cfu ml(-1) heterotrophic plate count (hpc), and 3.8 x 10(4), 9.9 x 10(3), 3.3 x 10(3) and 4.6 x 10(0)cfu 100 ml(-1) faecal coliforms (fc), staphylococcus aureus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa sp. and clostridium perfringes sp., respectively. further, three viral indicators monitored (somatic phage, host: escherichia coli cn(13) and f-rna phages, hosts:  e. coli f+(amp), e. coli k12) were not present in raw greywater. the greywater was treated by an rbc followed by sedimentation. the treatment removed two orders of magnitude of all bacteria. uv disinfection kinetics, survival and regrowth of  hpc, fc, p. aeruginosa sp. and s. aureus sp. were examined. at doses up to 69 mw  s cm(-2) fc were found to be the most resistant bacteria, followed by hpc, p. aeruginosa sp. and s. aureus sp. (inactivation rate coefficients: 0.0687, 0.113,  0.129 and 0.201 cm2 mw(-1)s(-1), respectively). at higher doses (69-439 mw s cm(-2)) all but hpc (which exhibited a tailing curve) were completely eliminated. microscopic examination showed that fc self-aggregate in the greywater effluent.  this provides fc an advantage at low doses, since the concentration of suspended  matter (that can provide shelter from uv radiation) in the effluent was very low. fc, p. aeruginosa sp. and s. aureus sp. did not exhibit regrowth up to 6h after exposure to increasing uv doses (19-439 mw s cm(-2)). hpc regrowth was proven to  be statistically significant in un-disinfected effluent and after irradiation with high uv doses (147 and 439 mw s cm(-2)). at these doses regrowth resulted from growth of uv-resistant bacteria due to decreased competition with other bacteria eliminated by the irradiation.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == [perioperative managements for postoperative severe infections in compromised host].
AB  == the incidence of postoperative infections, especially due to multi-drug resistant strains such as pseudomonas sp., enterococcus sp., and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), is high in compromised hosts. among them, respiratory infection, catheter sepsis, and drug-associated enteritis are frequently observed and respiratory infection is liable to fall into serious illness. these infections have characteristics in causative organisms. pseudomonas aeruginosa or mrsa are frequently isolated in respiratory infections  and candida or coagulase-negative staphylococcus are frequently isolated in catheter sepsis. g-test in addition to blood culture is necessary for early diagnosis of candida sepsis, vancomycin should be administered in early phase of  antibiotic-associated enteritis, since this infection is usually caused by mrsa or clostridium difficile and frequently falls into serious illness. the patients  with protein-calorie malnutrition, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, diabetes melitis, administration of anticancer drugs and/or radiation therapy, serious injury, or severe operative stress are considered to be compromised hosts in surgical field, and the adequate perioperative managements according to these disorders should be carried out against postoperative infections.

TI  == the role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods (bacteroides sp., prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp.), anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, abscesses and blood, compared to their number in the normal flora. the pathogenicity of bacteroides, fusobacterium, clostridium, and afgpc was studied by inoculating them into mice and observing their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas non-encapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (< 1%) survived in the abscesses, and they became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or non-viable encapsulated bacteria. thereafter, these strains were able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and afgpc-induced bacteraemia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the non-encapsulated form of the same strains. as determined by using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative  cultures of abscesses induced in mice, possession of a capsule generally made gram-negative anaerobic rods more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated gram-negative anaerobic rods and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and also between most afgpc  and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

TI  == antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

AB  == febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a hickman line-associated infection. at 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol  violation or death due to other causes. a total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. the diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (34), hodgkin's disease  (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), escherichia coli (13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), klebsiella sp. (3), enterobacter cloacae (2), streptococcus faecalis (2), ent. adenocarboxylata (1), clostridium septicum (1). strept. b (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and p. fluorescens (1), in-vitro testing showed that all  gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. there were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), strep. sangius (1), strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and p. maltophilia (1). both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. there is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. in view of the very high incidence of gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that  teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in  all febrile neutropenic patients.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. the spanish group for the study of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. according to the criteria of mccabe and jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. the clinical condition  of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or  good in 28. sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. the causative micro-organisms were: escherichia coli (18 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

TI  == [aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  == in a group of 600 patients treated in the metropolitan dermatological hospital in warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. in 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms  was obtained. coagulase-positive staphylococci (st. aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter sp and e. coli)  prevailed. in 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. in the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes  exclusively was noted. pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. in the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were gram-negative bacteria such as bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides sp, and bacteroides fragilis. among pathogenic anerobic cocci peptostreptococcus and peptococcus were most frequent. in 2 cases  spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (clostridium perfringens) were obtained. forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == efficacy and safety of cefpirome (hr810).
AB  == sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and  joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were escherichia coli (6), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and haemophilus influenzae (1). one patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. in wound cultures, three strains of staphylococcus aureus and one each of ps. aeruginosa and str. faecalis persisted. one enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. of isolated strains, only str. faecalis and methicillin resistant staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. adverse  effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). tolerance was good. cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefotaxime against clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == the present in vitro antibacterial activities of cefotaxime and 8 other cephalosporins (cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefpiramide, latamoxef, cefamandole, cefmetazole, cefotiam and cephazolin) were evaluated simultaneously in 384 strains of gram-positive cocci, 595 strains of enterobacteriaceae, 240 strains of non-fermenters and 143 strains of anaerobes and miscellaneous organisms. the results were expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range, mic50 and mic90. of the beta-lactams, cefotaxime and latamoxef exhibited the highest activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. mic90 of cefotaxime, however, for species of pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas  maltophilia, enterococci, bacteroides sp. and clostridium difficile were more than 100 mg/l. cefpiramide and cefoperazone were generally less active than these 2 agents. all strains were tested for beta-lactamase production by the cefinase disc method and the relationship of susceptibility to beta-lactams was evaluated  in each species. the need was demonstrated for periodic susceptibility testing to be performed to better guide empirical antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  == the effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. support for the importance of encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic and facultative gram-positive cocci (afgpc) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, compared to their number in the normal oral flora. studies of the pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria of the bacteroides, fusobacterium, and clostridium genera and afgpc are also presented. the organisms were inoculated into mice and their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses was determined. encapsulated bacteroides, fusobacteria, and afgpc generally induced abscesses, whereas unencapsulated organisms did not. however, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (less than 1%) survived in the abscess,  and became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or nonviable encapsulated bacteria. these strains were thereafter able to induce abscesses when injected alone. encapsulated bacteroides sp. and anaerobic cocci induced bacteremia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the unencapsulated form of the same strains. the relative importance of encapsulated anaerobes in relation to their aerobic and facultative counterparts in mixed infection was studied, using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice. with few exceptions, possession of a capsule made bacteroides sp. more important than their aerobic counterparts. synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated bacteroides sp. and all tested aerobic bacteria and most afgpc, and between most  afgpc and pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus. these studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. a-56620 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, bacteroides sp. and clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. a-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than a-56620. both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae (mic 0.015 micrograms/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mk less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). both agents were more active against streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. they inhibited enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus  at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. these agents show  overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.

TI  == [in vitro activity of a new 3d-generation cephalosporin, cefodizime, on hospital  bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. for enterobacteriaceae mics ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode mic: 0.25); mode mics varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for citrobacter; mics ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for serratia. the rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were citrobacter or enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter, with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128. haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly  susceptible (mic less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low  mics (0.03-0.12). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.

TI  == the antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  == to test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a proteus sp., an erysipelothrix sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae. tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal  doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma  concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. the intracutaneous injection of fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to  this effect. the in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low mic; a low mic was sometimes associated with little action and a high mic with moderate action. sixteen organisms were tested. the iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of  e. rhusiopathiae. in only one case, with a strain of proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. on the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and c. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-c streptococcus and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, e. rhusiopathiae and a. hydrophila. it is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate  excess of readily available fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement  of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.

(mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).
