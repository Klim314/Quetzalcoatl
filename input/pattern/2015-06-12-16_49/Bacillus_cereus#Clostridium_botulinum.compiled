TI  - Microbiological and physicochemical analysis of yatei (Tetragonisca angustula) honey for assessing quality standards and commercialization.
AB  - Due to the interest in the production and trading of yatei (Tetragonisca angustula) honey in the province of Misiones, Argentina, in this work we assessed microbiological and physicochemical parameters in order to contribute to the elaboration of standards for quality control and promote commercialization. Results showed that yatei honey samples had significantly different microbiological and physicochemical characteristics in comparison to established quality standards for Apis mellifera honey. Thus, we observed that values for pH (3.72), glucose (19.01 g/100g) and fructose (23.74 g/100g) were lower than A. mellifera quality standards, while acidity (79.42 meq/kg), moisture (24%), and mould and yeast count (MY) (3.02 log CFU/g) were higher. The acid content was correlated with glucose (R2=0.75) and fructose (R2=0.68) content, and also with mould and yeast counts (R2=0.45) to a lesser extent. The incidence of microorganisms in yatei honey samples reached 42.85% and 39% for Clostridium sulfite-reducers and Bacillus spp., respectively. No C. botulinum or B. cereus cells were detected. Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. incidence was similar (ca. 7.14%), whereas Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. were not detected. We conclude that the microbiological and physicochemical properties of yatei honey are different from those of A. mellifera honey; hence, different quality standards could be implemented to promote its commercialization.
TI  - Probabilistic exposure assessment model to estimate aseptic-UHT product failure rate.
AB  - Aseptic-Ultra-High-Temperature (UHT) products are manufactured to be free of microorganisms capable of growing in the food at normal non-refrigerated conditions at which the food is likely to be held during manufacture, distribution and storage. Two important phases within the process are widely recognised as critical in controlling microbial contamination: the sterilisation steps and the following aseptic steps. Of the microbial hazards, the pathogen spore formers Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus cereus are deemed the most pertinent to be controlled. In addition, due to a relatively high thermal resistance, Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores are considered a concern for spoilage of low acid aseptic-UHT products. A probabilistic exposure assessment model has been developed in order to assess the aseptic-UHT product failure rate associated with these three bacteria. It was a Modular Process Risk Model, based on nine modules. They described: i) the microbial contamination introduced by the raw materials, either from the product (i.e. milk, cocoa and dextrose powders and water) or the packaging (i.e. bottle and sealing component), ii) the sterilisation processes, of either the product or the packaging material, iii) the possible recontamination during subsequent processing of both product and packaging. The Sterility Failure Rate (SFR) was defined as the sum of bottles contaminated for each batch, divided by the total number of bottles produced per process line run (10(6) batches simulated per process line). The SFR associated with the three bacteria was estimated at the last step of the process (i.e. after Module 9) but also after each module, allowing for the identification of modules, and responsible contamination pathways, with higher or lower intermediate SFR. The model contained 42 controlled settings associated with factory environment, process line or product formulation, and more than 55 probabilistic inputs corresponding to inputs with variability conditional to a mean uncertainty. It was developed in @Risk and run through Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, the highest SFR was associated with G. stearothermophilus (380000 bottles contaminated in 10(11) bottles produced) and the lowest to C. botulinum (3 bottles contaminated in 10(11) bottles produced). Unsurprisingly, SFR due to G. stearothermophilus was due to its ability to survive the UHT treatment. More interestingly, it was identified that SFR due to B. cereus (17000 bottles contaminated in 10(11) bottles produced) was due to an airborne recontamination of the aseptic tank (49%) and a post-sterilisation packaging contamination (33%). A deeper analysis (sensitivity and scenario analyses) was done to investigate how the SFR due to B. cereus could be reduced by changing the process settings related to potential air recontamination source.
TI  - Clostridium and bacillus binary enterotoxins: bad for the bowels, and eukaryotic  being.
AB  - Some pathogenic spore-forming bacilli employ a binary protein mechanism for intoxicating the intestinal tracts of insects, animals, and humans. These Gram-positive bacteria and their toxins include Clostridium botulinum (C2 toxin), Clostridium difficile (C. difficile toxin or CDT), Clostridium perfringens (iota-toxin and binary enterotoxin, or BEC), Clostridium spiroforme (C. spiroforme toxin or CST), as well as Bacillus cereus (vegetative insecticidal protein or VIP). These gut-acting proteins form an AB complex composed of ADP-ribosyl transferase (A) and cell-binding (B) components that intoxicate cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal trafficking. Once inside the cytosol, the A components inhibit normal cell functions by mono-ADP-ribosylation of globular actin, which induces cytoskeletal disarray and death. Important aspects of each bacterium and binary enterotoxin will be highlighted in this review, with particular focus upon the disease process involving the biochemistry and modes of action for each toxin.
TI  - Food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  - The term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following recent consumption of a particular food or drink. Millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. The food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus, Arcobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. botulinum and Bacillus cereus and helminths viz., Taenia. They also include protozoa viz., Trichinella, Sarcocystis, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum. The zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. The viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. Food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. This along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. ELISA, Latex agglutination test, Lateral flow assays, Immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), multiplex PCR, immuno-PCR, Realtime PCR, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR, DNA microarrays and probes are widely used. Along with these LAMP assays, Capillary Electrophoresis-Single Strand Confirmation polymorphism (CE-SSCP); Flow cytometry, FISH, Biosensors, Direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. Most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. With the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. Adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to HACCP principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. All these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.
TI  - Pathogenic psychrotolerant sporeformers: an emerging challenge for low-temperature storage of minimally processed foods.
AB  - Sporeforming bacteria are a significant problem in the food industry as they are  ubiquitous in nature and capable of resisting inactivation by heat and chemical treatments designed to inactivate them. Beyond spoilage issues, psychrotolerant sporeformers are becoming increasingly recognized as a potential hazard given the ever-expanding demand for refrigerated processed foods with extended shelf-life. In these products, the sporeforming pathogens of concern are Bacillus cereus, Bacillus weihenstephanensis, and Clostridium botulinum type E. This review article examines the foods, conditions, and organisms responsible for the food safety issue caused by the germination and outgrowth of psychrotolerant sporeforming pathogens in minimally processed refrigerated foods.
TI  - Growth/no growth models for heat-treated psychrotrophic Bacillus cereus spores under cold storage.
AB  - The microbiological safety of refrigerated and processed foods of extended durability (REPFED) is linked to spore-forming pathogens, more specifically Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus cereus. In this study two sets of growth/no growth (GNG) models are presented for the spores of two B. cereus strains. The models incorporate both product (water activity (a(w)) and pH) and process parameters (pasteurization value at 90 degrees C (P(90)) or heating temperature). The first model evaluates the effect of four different P(90)-values (P(90)=0, 4, 7 or 10 min, all applied at 90 degrees C) on the germination and subsequent growth of B. cereus spores under different conditions of pH and a(w) at 10 degrees C. These models show that a heat treatment not only increases the time to growth (TTG), but also significantly increases the minimal a(w) and pH necessary for germination and subsequent growth: e.g. at a(w) 0.995 and without heat treatment (P(90)=0), strain FF355 B. cereus spores were predicted to germinate and grow at pH 5.3. With a P(90) of 10 min, the minimal pH increased to 5.7. The second set of models for B. cereus spores compares the effect of three heat treatments with the same P(90)-value (10 min) but applied at different temperatures (85, 87 and 90 degrees C), on the germination and subsequent growth at 10 degrees C. The second model shows that lower heating temperatures (85 and 87 degrees C) had less effect on the TTG and minimal a(w) and pH than a higher temperature (90 degrees C). Finally, the first set of models was validated in broth using spores of seven psychrotrophic B. cereus strains, to evaluate the effect of strain variability on the model predictions. The results of the validation (% growth) were compared to the predicted growth probability. The results showed that the models were prone to fail-dangerous results (i.e. predicting no growth when growth was observed: 17%-34%). Using a very low threshold for growth (0.1% predicted chance of growth was considered to be complete growth), the models were more fail-safe (11%-34%) than fail-dangerous (0.4%-14%).
TI  - Inhibition of macrophage migration by C. botulinum exoenzyme C3.
AB  - C3-like exoenzymes are produced by various microorganism including Clostridium botulinum (C3bot), Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. C3bot is the prototype of C3-like exoenzymes that specifically ADP-ribosylates and thereby inactivates Rho(A/B/C). C3-like exoenzymes are not yet regarded as virulence factors, as the lack of cell entry domains results in a poor accessibility of the C3-like exoenzymes to cells. In this study, the sensitivity of various cell lines to C3bot has been reinvestigated. Primary monocytes as well as cultured macrophage-like cells including J774A.1 cells and RAW macrophages exhibit a tenfold higher sensitivity to C3bot than fibroblasts and epithelial cells. RhoA ADP-ribosylation by C3bot resulted in the formation of pronounced bipolar protrusions based on defective tail retraction. The formation of bipolar protrusion resulted in inhibited macrophage migration. These findings suggested that macrophages appear to be target cells of C3bot. Migration of macrophage is a prerequiste for their recruitment to the site of pathogen invasion or tissue damage. Inhibition of macrophage migration likely preserves the survival of C3-producing microorganisms. The observations of this study reinforce the paradigm of a role of C3-like exoenzymes as virulence factors.
TI  - [Microbiological evaluation of ready-to-eat foods manufactured by small Costa Rican industries].
AB  - Ready-to-eat (RTE) foods are processed foodstuffs which have gained popularity in recent times because they can be ingested without further thermic treatments. In this work, the microbiological quality and safety of 90 samples of RTE foods manufactured by small Costa Rican industries was determined to evaluate whether they represent a Public Health risk. Twenty-six samples of pickled vegetables, 18 dips, 18 salads, and 12 sweet treats were studied. Each sample was analyzed with regard to its pH, the presence of culturable microbiological quality indicators and recognized foodborne pathogens (Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes. Clostridium perfringens, C. botulinum, and Bacillus cereus) Selected genes encoding toxins of C. botulinum and C. perfringens were screened by PCR. Thirty-seven percent of the samples had a level of acidity that could allow the growth and proliferation of bacterial pathogens (pH > or = 4.5). The shelf-life indicators were acceptable but only if the RTE foods are kept at adequate conditions of temperature and humidity. Sixty-four percent of the RTE foods had total coliforms values that evidence inadequate hygiene practices during its elaboration (MPN/g >1000). This result was confirmed by the finding of fecal coliforms in 56% of the samples, which, by the way, are inacceptable for human consumption. All cultures for pathogens were negative, except for 4 samples that contained B. cereus. Toxins of C. botulinum were not detected and one single sample was positive for the PCR for C. perfringens. The elevated degree of fecal contamination detected in the RTE could be prevented by means of good manufacturing practices, better hygiene measures and a deeper attention to critical control points.
TI  - Partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two Lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
AB  - The probiotic characteristics of Lactobacillus brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33, isolated from traditional Turkish Tulum cheese were assessed. These two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg mL(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg mL(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at pH 2. They were also adhered to Caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to Escherichia coli LMG3083 (ETEC) and Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344. The strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature, and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. The bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Tricine-SDS-PAGE of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kDA and 2.7 kDA for Lb. brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33 bacteriocins, respectively.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - Effect of high pressure on the microbiological quality of cooked chicken during storage at normal and abuse refrigeration temperatures.
AB  - Vacuum-packaged cooked poultry meat was treated at a range of pressures (400-600  MPa) and hold times (1, 2 and 10 min), followed by storage at 4 degrees , 8 degrees or 12 degrees C for up to 35 days. Weissella viridescens was found to be the dominant microorganism in the pressure-treated meat, constituting 100% of the microflora identified at 500 and 600 MPa. None of the pressure-treated samples had obvious signs of spoilage during the 35 day storage period, even when the Weissella count was >7 log(10) cfu/g. Studies on a typical W. viridescens isolate showed it to be relatively pressure-resistant in poultry meat, with <1 log reduction in numbers after a treatment of 2 min at 600 MPa. Agar diffusion assays showed that the isolate also caused the inhibition of a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including strains of Clostridium botulinum, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. The selection of a pressure-resistant organism, such as this Weissella sp. could be advantageous in extending the shelf-life, and also microbiological safety, of the cooked meat, as it could give protection in addition to the pressure treatment itself.
TI  - Multi-tools approach for food safety risk management of steam meals.
AB  - Steamed meals comprise a new type of meal in which various raw ingredients are packed together and then cooked by the consumer just before consumption. The presence of raw ingredients and the absence of any inactivation step before home cooking could significantly impact the safety of these meals. In this study some of the many tools available to assess food safety were combined to determine the factors affecting the food safety of this new kind of meal. First the hazards were identified using Stepwise and Interactive Evaluation of Food Safety by an Expert System (SIEFE); then food safety objectives for various food pathogens were determined, and hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP), Risk Ranger, and predictive microbiology (gamma model) were used to determine the appropriate measures to meet the target set. Finally, links to the performance objective of the cooking stage are also proposed for Salmonella as it had the lowest food safety objectives. The SIEFE methodology excluded only Clostridium botulinum from the possible foodborne pathogens capable of causing foodborne illnesses from these meals, while use of HACCP and modelling demonstrated that cooking is the critical step in preparation of the meals. Risk Ranger was used to rank the possible pathogens: Salmonella and Campylobacter scores were the highest, Bacillus cereus the lowest. Risk Ranger was also used to assess the effect of the cooking stage on food safety and confirmed the importance of this process.
TI  - Rapid detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples by an improved reverse dot blot method.
AB  - AIM: To develop a new, rapid and accurate reverse dot blot (RDB) method for the detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples. METHODS: The 12 intestinal pathogens tested were Salmonella spp., Brucella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The two universal primers were designed to amplify two variable regions of bacterial 16S and 23S rDNA genes from all of the 12 bacterial species tested. Five hundred and forty fecal samples from the diarrhea patients were detected using the improved RDB assay. RESULTS: The methods could identify the 12 intestinal pathogens specifically, and the detection limit was as low as 103 CFUs. The consistent detection rate of the improved RDB assay compared with the traditional culture method was up to 88.75%. CONCLUSION: The hybridization results indicated that the improved RDB assay developed was a reliable method for the detection of intestinal pathogen in fecal samples.
TI  - Erythrophore cell response to food-associated pathogenic bacteria: implications for detection.
AB  - Cell-based biosensors have been proposed for use as function-based detectors of toxic agents. We report the use of Betta splendens chromatophore cells, specifically erythrophore cells, for detection of food-associated pathogenic bacteria. Evaluation of erythrophore cell response, using Bacillus spp., has revealed that this response can distinguish pathogenic Bacillus cereus from a non-pathogenic B. cereus DeltaplcR deletion mutant and a non-pathogenic Bacillus subtilis. Erythrophore cells were exposed to Salmonella enteritidis, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum. Each bacterial pathogen elicited a response from erythrophore cells that was distinguished from the corresponding bacterial growth medium, and this observed response was unique for each bacterial pathogen. These findings suggest that erythrophore cell response has potential for use as a biosensor in the detection and toxicity assessment for food-associated pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Levels and toxigenicity of Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens from retail seafood.
AB  - For the period 1990 through 2003, seafood was the most commonly identified food linked to foodborne outbreaks in the United States. Fish as a commodity has rarely been examined for the presence of Bacillus cereus in particular. For the present study, 347 fresh and processed retail seafood samples were examined for the presence of Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium perfringens, and B. cereus. The presence of C. botulinum was not confirmed in any of the isolates, but C. perfringens was confirmed in 17 samples. One of the C. perfringens isolates possessed the enterotoxin gene, as determined by PCR. In contrast, 62 confirmed B. cereus isolates were obtained from separate samples at levels ranging from 3.6 to > 1,100 CFU/g. Thirty (48%) of 62 isolates produced both the hemolysin BL (HBL) and nonhemolytic (NHE) enterotoxins, and 58 (94%) and 31 (50%) produced NHE or HBL toxins, respectively. The presence of at least one of the three genes of the NHE complex was detected in 99% of the isolates; 69% of the isolates possessed all three genes. In contrast, 71% of the isolates possessed at least one of the three genes of the HBL complex, and 37% possessed all three HBL gene components. Fifty of the 62 B. cereus isolates were from imported seafood, and 19 (38%) of these samples were at levels > 100 CFU/g. Twelve of the 14 highest enterotoxin assay results were from isolates from imported food. Only one B. cereus isolate possessed the cereulide synthetase gene, ces; this isolate also possessed the genes for the three-component HBL and NHE complexes. A majority of enterotoxin-producing isolates were resistant to 2 of 10 antibiotics tested, ceftriaxone and clindamycin. Our results demonstrate the potential of seafood as a vehicle for foodborne illness caused by B. cereus, in particular the enterotoxin-producing genotype.
TI  - Crystal structure of the Clostridium limosum C3 exoenzyme.
AB  - C3-like toxins ADP-ribosylate and inactivate Rho GTPases. Seven C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases produced by Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium limosum, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus were identified and two representatives--C3bot from C. botulinum and C3stau2 from S. aureus--were crystallized. Here we present the 1.8A structure of C. limosum C3 transferase C3lim and compare it to the structures of other family members. In contrast to the structure of apo-C3bot, the canonical ADP-ribosylating turn turn motif is observed in a primed conformation, ready for NAD binding. This suggests an impact on the binding mode of NAD and on the transferase reaction. The crystal structure explains why auto-ADP-ribosylation of C3lim at Arg41 interferes with the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the toxin.
TI  - A probabilistic modeling approach in thermal inactivation: estimation of postprocess Bacillus cereus spore prevalence and concentration.
AB  - The survival of spore-forming bacteria is linked to the safety and stability of refrigerated processed foods of extended durability (REPFEDs). A probabilistic modeling approach was used to assess the prevalence and concentration of Bacillus cereus spores surviving heat treatment for a semiliquid chilled food product. This product received heat treatment to inactivate nonproteolytic Clostridium botulinum during manufacture and was designed to be kept at refrigerator temperature postmanufacture. As key inputs for the modeling, the assessment took into consideration the following factors: (i) contamination frequency (prevalence) and level (concentration) of both psychrotrophic and mesophilic strains of B. cereus, (ii) heat resistance of both types (expressed as decimal reduction times at 90 degrees C), and (iii) intrapouch variability of thermal kinetics during heat processing (expressed as the time spent at 90 degrees C). These three inputs were established as statistical distributions using expert opinion, literature data, and specific modeling, respectively. They were analyzed in a probabilistic model in which the outputs, expressed as distributions as well, were the proportion of the contaminated pouches (the likely prevalence) and the number of spores in the contaminated pouches (the likely concentration). The prevalence after thermal processing was estimated to be 11 and 49% for psychrotrophic and mesophilic strains, respectively. In the positive pouches, the bacterial concentration (considering psychrotrophic and mesophilic strains combined) was estimated to be 30 CFU/g (95th percentile). Such a probabilistic approach seems promising to help in (i) optimizing heat processes, (ii) identifying which key factor(s) to control, and (iii) providing information for subsequent assessment of B. cereus resuscitation and growth.
TI  - Exchange of glutamine-217 to glutamate of Clostridium limosum exoenzyme C3 turns  the asparagine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase into an arginine-modifying enzyme.
AB  - C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferaseses are produced by Clostridium species, Bacillus cereus, and various Staphylococcus aureus strains. The exoenzymes modify the low-molecular-mass GTPases RhoA, B, and C. In structural studies of C3-like exoenzymes, an ARTT-motif (ADP-ribosylating turn-turn motif) was identified that appears to be involved in substrate specificity and recognition (Han, S., Arvai, A. S., Clancy, S. B., Tainer, J. A. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 305, 95-107). Exchange of Gln217, which is a key residue of the ARTT-motif, to Glu in C3 from Clostridium limosum results in inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity toward RhoA. The mutant protein is still capable of NAD-binding and possesses NAD+ glycohydrolase activity. Whereas recombinant wild-type C3 modifies Rho proteins specifically at an asparagine residue (Asn41), Gln217Glu-C3 is capable of ADP-ribosylation of poly-arginine but not poly-asparagine. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, a model substrate for many arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases, is modified by the Gln217Glu-C3 transferase. Also in C3 ADP-ribosyltransferases from Clostridium botulinum and B. cereus, the exchange of the equivalent Gln residue to Glu blocked asparagine modification of RhoA but elicited arginine-specific ADP-ribosylation. Moreover, the Gln217Glu-C3lim transferase was able to ADP-ribosylate recombinant wild-type C3lim at Arg86, resulting in decrease in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the wild-type enzyme. The data indicate that the exchange of one amino acid residue in the ARTT-motif turns the asparagine-modifying ADP-ribosyltransferases of the C3 family into arginine-ADP-ribosylating transferases.
TI  - A systematic approach to determine global thermal inactivation parameters for various food pathogens.
AB  - Thermal inactivation of pathogens has been studied extensively, which has resulted in a wide range of D- and z-values. Estimating the inactivation rate for a specific condition based on these reported values is difficult, since one has to select representative conditions, and data obtained exactly at the required representative conditions are generally not available. Therefore, a first step could be to globally assess a heat treatment taking into account largest effects only. Once the most important parameters are known, a more precise study of inactivation can be performed. Therefore, in this study a large quantity of D-values (n=4066) was collected from literature for various pathogens and linear regression was applied to obtain average D-values (together with the 95% upper prediction level) and z-values. When comparing these overall data, it can be seen that most factors reported to have an effect on the D-value are smaller than the variability of all published D-values. Even effects of shoulders disappear in the overall analysis. Only a limited number of factors that did have a significant effect (p<0.05) on the D-value were identified: for Salmonella spp., the presence of chocolate ingredients gave protection to the cells, for Listeria monocytogenes the presence of 10% salt (or a(w)<0.92) resulted in a higher heat resistance, for Bacillus cereus there were significant differences for various strains and in oily products and for Clostridium botulinum there were significant differences in heat resistance between different types of C. botulinum. This does not mean that other effects do not occur, but it shows the main effects that have to be included for a first impression on the performance of a heating process. The obtained 95% upper prediction levels of the D-values can be used as a (conservative) estimate of inactivation and can be used to give order of magnitude values in overall process evaluations.
TI  - A modified Weibull model for bacterial inactivation.
AB  - In this paper, a modified Weibull model is proposed to fit microbial survival curves. This model can incorporate shoulder and/or tailing phenomena if they are encountered. We aim to obtain an accurate fit of the "primary" modelling of the bacterial inactivation and to provide a useful and meaningful model for biologists and food industry. A delta parameter close to the classical concept of the D value, established for sterilisation processes, is used in the model. The specific parameterisation of the Weibull model is evaluated for the parameter of interest delta. The goodness-of-fit of the model is compared to the one produced by the model proposed by Geeraerd et al., [Geeraerd, A.H., Herremans, C.H., Van Impe, J.F., 2000. Structural model requirements to describe microbial inactivation during a mild heat treatment. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 59, 185-209.] on experimental data. As our model provides good fits for the different types of survival curves analysed, further research can focus on the development of suitable secondary model types. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the delta parameter is close to the D concept.
TI  - Molecular recognition of an ADP-ribosylating Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme by RalA GTPase.
AB  - C3 exoenzymes (members of the ADP-ribosyltranferase family) are produced by Clostridium botulinum (C3bot1 and -2), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), Bacillus cereus (C3cer), and Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau1-3). These exoenzymes lack a translocation domain but are known to specifically inactivate Rho GTPases in host target cells. Here, we report the crystal structure of C3bot1 in complex with RalA (a GTPase of the Ras subfamily) and GDP at a resolution of 2.66 A. RalA is not ADP-ribosylated by C3 exoenzymes but inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3bot1, C3lim, and C3cer to different extents. The structure provides an insight into the molecular interactions between C3bot1 and RalA involving the catalytic ADP-ribosylating turn-turn (ARTT) loop from C3bot1 and helix alpha4 and strand beta6 (which are not part of the GDP-binding pocket) from RalA. The structure also suggests a molecular explanation for the different levels of C3-exoenzyme inhibition by RalA and why RhoA does not bind C3bot1 in this manner.
TI  - Comparison of pressure and heat resistance of Clostridium botulinum and other endospores in mashed carrots.
AB  - Inactivation of bacterial endospores in food requires a combination of pressure and moderate heat. Endospore resistance of seven Clostridium botulinum strains was compared with those of Bacillus spp. (B. cereus, B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. smithii, B. amyloliquefaciens) and Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum with respect to pressure (600 to 800 MPa) and temperature (80 to 116 degrees C) treatments in mashed carrots. A large variation was observed in the pressure resistance of C. botulinum spores. Their reduction after treatments with 600 MPa at 80 degrees C for 1 s ranged from more than 5.5 log units to no reduction. Spores of the proteolytic C. botulinum TMW 2.357 exhibited a greater resistance to pressure than spores from all other bacteria examined, with the exception of B. amyloliquefaciens. Heat resistance of spores did not correlate with pressure resistance, either within strains of C. botulinum or when C. botulinum spores were compared with spores of T. thermosaccharolyticum. A quantitative release of dipicolinic acid was observed from C. botulinum spores on combined pressure and temperature treatments only after inactivation of more than 99.999% of the spores. Thus, dipicolinic acid is released by a physicochemical rather than a physiological process. The resistance of spores to combined pressure and temperature treatments correlated with their ability to retain dipicolinic acid. B. amyloliquefaciens, a mesophilic organism that forms highly pressure-resistant spores is proposed as a nonpathogenic target organism for high-pressure process development.
TI  - Binary bacterial toxins: biochemistry, biology, and applications of common Clostridium and Bacillus proteins.
AB  - Certain pathogenic species of Bacillus and Clostridium have developed unique methods for intoxicating cells that employ the classic enzymatic "A-B" paradigm for protein toxins. The binary toxins produced by B. anthracis, B. cereus, C. botulinum, C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. spiroforme consist of components not physically associated in solution that are linked to various diseases in humans, animals, or insects. The "B" components are synthesized as precursors that are subsequently activated by serine-type proteases on the targeted cell surface and/or in solution. Following release of a 20-kDa N-terminal peptide, the activated "B" components form homoheptameric rings that subsequently dock with an "A" component(s) on the cell surface. By following an acidified endosomal route and translocation into the cytosol, "A" molecules disable a cell (and host organism) via disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, increasing intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, or inactivation of signaling pathways linked to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases. Recently, B. anthracis has gleaned much notoriety as a biowarfare/bioterrorism agent, and of primary interest has been the edema and lethal toxins, their role in anthrax, as well as the development of efficacious vaccines and therapeutics targeting these virulence factors and ultimately B. anthracis. This review comprehensively surveys the literature and discusses the similarities, as well as distinct differences, between each Clostridium and Bacillus binary toxin in terms of their biochemistry, biology, genetics, structure, and applications in science and medicine. The information may foster future studies that aid novel vaccine and drug development, as well as a better understanding of a conserved intoxication process utilized by various gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Characterization of Bacillus cereus isolates from raw soybean sprouts.
AB  - Raw soybean sprouts, which are used as ingredients in cook-chilled products, were analyzed to evaluate the incidence of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms, psychrotrophic microorganisms, anaerobic microorganisms, coliforms, and spore-forming microorganisms Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium perfringens. Mesophilic microorganisms on raw soybean sprouts were present in large populations, 5.5 x 10(6) to 1.4 x 10(8) CFU/g, and psychrotrophic microorganisms were found to be more numerous than the other groups. Coliforms accounted for 15% of mesophilic microorganism counts on average, and the average for spore-forming microorganisms was 5.2 x 10(2) CFU/g. B. cereus was isolated from 12 of 17 soybean sprout samples, whereas C. botulinum and C. perfringens were not isolated. B. cereus was isolated in greater numbers at 30 degrees C compared with other temperatures and was not isolated at 4 degrees C. Of the 55 strains isolated from soybean sprouts, 52 were positive for starch hydrolysis, and only 3 strains did not hydrolyze starch. Among the 55 strains of B. cereus isolates, 53 showed the ability to produce diarrheal enterotoxin by CRET-RPLA.
TI  - Shelf life and safety concerns of bakery products--a review.
AB  - Bakery products are an important part of a balanced diet and, today, a wide variety of such products can be found on supermarket shelves. This includes unsweetened goods (bread, rolls, buns, crumpets, muffins and bagels), sweet goods (pancakes, doughnuts, waffles and cookies) and filled goods (fruit and meat pies, sausage rolls, pastries, sandwiches, cream cakes, pizza and quiche). However, bakery products, like many processed foods, are subject to physical, chemical and microbiological spoilage. While physical and chemical spoilage limits the shelf life of low and intermediate moisture bakery products, microbiological spoilage by bacteria, yeast and molds is the concern in high moisture products i.e., products with a water activity (a(w)) > 0.85. Furthermore, several bakery products also have been implicated infoodborne illnesses involving Salmonella spp., Listeria monoctyogenes and Bacillus cereus, while Clostridium botulinum is a concern in high moisture bakery products packaged under modified atmospheres. This extensive review is divided into two parts. Part I focuses on the spoilage concerns of low, intermediate and high moisture bakery products while Part II focuses on the safety concerns of high moisture bakery products only. In both parts, traditional and novel methods of food preservation that can be used by the bakery industry to extend the shelf life and enhance the safety of products are discussed in detail.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the bactericidal effects of Japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. Konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the pH of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). Konjac fluids completely inactivated Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 and E. coil O26:H9, Salmonella Enteritidis, Vibrio parahemolyticus. and Staphylococcus aureus. The initial level of 6 log CFU/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable S. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. On the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum type E and type A). At least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. Vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. When the initial cell count was 6 log CFU/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected after 120 days. When the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log CFU/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within I to 3 days. Repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. Our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.
TI  - Rho-specific Bacillus cereus ADP-ribosyltransferase C3cer cloning and characterization.
AB  - C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases represent an expanding family of related exoenzymes, which are produced by Clostridia and various Staphylococcus aureus strains. Here we report on the cloning and biochemical characterization of an ADP-ribosyltransferase from Bacillus cereus strain 2339. The transferase encompasses 219 amino acids; it has a predicted mass of 25.2 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 9.3. To indicate the relationship to the family of C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases, we termed the enzyme C3cer. The amino acid sequence of C3cer is 30 to 40% identical to other C3-like exoenzymes. By site-directed mutagenesis, Arg(59), Arg(97), Tyr(151), Arg(155), Thr(178), Tyr(180), Gln(183), and Glu(185) of recombinant C3cer were identified as pivotal residues of enzyme activity and/or protein substrate recognition. Precipitation experiments with immobilized RhoA revealed that C3cerTyr(180), which is located in the so-called "ADP-ribosylating toxin turn-turn" (ARTT) motif, plays a major role in the recognition of RhoA. Like other C3-like exoenzymes, C3cer ADP-ribosylates preferentially RhoA and RhoB and to a much lesser extent RhoC. Because the cellular accessibility of recombinant C3cer is low, a fusion toxin (C2IN-C3cer), consisting of the N-terminal 225 amino acid residues of the enzyme component of C2 toxin from Clostridium botulinum and C3cer was used to study the cytotoxic effects of the transferase. This fusion toxin caused rounding up of Vero cells comparable to the effects of Rho-inactivating toxins.
TI  - Variability in spore germination response by strains of proteolytic Clostridium botulinum types A, B and F.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of the study was to evaluate the variability of germination response of 10 strains of proteolytic Clostridium botulinum. METHODS AND RESULTS: An automated turbidometric method was used to follow the fall in optical density. Spores of proteolytic Cl. botulinum germinated in response to l-alanine alone, with rate and extent of germination increased by addition of l-lactate or bicarbonate ions. Other hydrophobic amino acids also triggered germination of spores of proteolytic Cl. botulinum but not AGFK and inosine, germinants for Bacillus subtilis or B. cereus. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike spores of nonproteolytic Cl. botulinum, all proteolytic Cl. botulinum germinate in hydrophobic l-amino acids without l-lactate. However, a great variability of response to germinant is evidenced between the species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The selection of a model strain to study germination of Cl. botulinum spores should consider the variability in sensitivity to germinants shown in this work. In particular, the sequenced strain ATCC 3502 may not be the most appropriate model for germination studies.
TI  - An investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  - In 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the UK and Ireland was reported and Clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to C. botulinum and Bacillus cereus were also reported. Because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in England during 2000 and 2002. Two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. The first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (MRD) which was inoculated directly into Clostridium Botulinum Isolation Cooked Meat Broth (CBI). The second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in CBI broth. Duplicate CBI broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees C for 30 min. Subcultures were made after incubation for 7 and 14 days on to eight different solid media. The methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either C. botulinum or C. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. Fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the MRD suspension technique. Fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. No fungi were isolated. Aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (Bacillus spp. and Paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at least one species was isolated from each sample. B. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with B. licheniformis isolated from 40%. Between one and five samples yielded cultures of B. coagulans, B. laterosporus, B. pumilus, B. subtilis and P. macerans. Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; S. warneri and S. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. One or two samples yielded cultures of S. aureus, S. capitis and S. haemolyticus. The remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with C. perfringens and two samples with either C. sordellii or C. tertium. Multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the remaining 15. In 13 samples B. cereus alone was isolated, in one B. subtilis alone and in one sample B. pumilus alone. C. botulinum and C. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. Recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.
TI  - Bacteriological safety issues in red meat and ready-to-eat meat products, as well as control measures.
AB  - The importance of Eschericha coli O157, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium DT104 as meat-borne pathogens is well established. Pathogenic bacteria such as Aeromonas spp., Arcobacter spp., psychrotrophic Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium botulinum and non-invasive Listeria monocytogenes can be regarded as rookies, but not yet firmly associated with today's production of red meat and meat products. The development of PCR and other DNA-based techniques will shed new light on so called emerging pathogens. Important safety issues in meat production, such as insufficient cleaning and disinfection (including the stable/lairage, processing environment), carcass decontamination and chilling, and cross contamination are discussed. Furthermore, probability modelling of survival and growth is identified as an important way to achieve a better understanding of how to deal with the complexity of further processing, including heat treatment and storage.
TI  - Interaction of the Rho-ADP-ribosylating C3 exoenzyme with RalA.
AB  - RhoA, -B, and -C are ADP-ribosylated and biologically inactivated by Clostridium  botulinum C3 exoenzyme and related C3-like transferases. We report that RalA GTPase, which is not ADP-ribosylated by C3, inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3 from C. botulinum (C3bot), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), and Bacillus cereus (C3cer) but not from Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau) in human platelet membranes and rat brain lysate. Inhibition by RalA occurs with the GDP- and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-bound forms of RalA and is overcome by increasing concentrations of C3. A direct interaction of RalA with C3 was verified by precipitation of the transferase with GST-RalA-Sepharose. The affinity constant (K(d)) of the binding of RalA to C3lim was 12 nm as determined by fluorescence titration. RalA increased the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot by about 5-fold. Although RalA had no effect on glucosylation of Rho GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin B, C3bot and C3lim inhibited glucosylation of RalA by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. Furthermore, C3bot decreased activation of phospholipase D by RalA. The data indicate that several C3 exoenzymes directly interact with RalA without ADP-ribosylating the GTPase. The interaction is of high affinity and interferes with essential functions of C3 and RalA.
TI  - On calculating sterility in thermal preservation methods: application of the Weibull frequency distribution model.
AB  - A simple and parsimonious model which originated from the Weibull frequency distribution was proposed to describe nonlinear survival curves of spores. This model was suitable for downward concavity curves (Bacillus cereus and Bacillus pumilus), as well as for upward concavity curves (Clostridium botulinum). It was shown that traditional F values calculated from this new model were no longer additive, to such an extent that a heat treatment should be better characterized by the obtained decimal reduction of spores. A modified Bigelow method was then proposed to assess this decade reduction or to optimize the heat treatment for a target reduction ratio.
TI  - C3stau, a new member of the family of C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases.
AB  - C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases, which are produced by Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium limosum, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, are exoenzymes lacking a translocation unit. These enzymes specifically inactivate Rho GTPases in host target cells. Recently, a novel C3-like transferase from S. aureus with new properties was identified, raising questions regarding its function. As Rho GTPases are master regulators of several eukaryotic signal processes and S. aureus can invade eukaryotic cells, C3 might play a role as a virulence factor.
TI  - Analysis of the role of bacterial endospore cortex structure in resistance properties and demonstration of its conservation amongst species.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this work was to compare the chemical structure of the spore cortex of a range of species, and to determine any correlation between cortex structure and spore resistance properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: The fine chemical structure of the cortex of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium botulinum was examined by muropeptide analysis using reverse phase HPLC. There is a conserved basic structure between peptidoglycan of these species, with the only difference being the level of de-N-acetylation of an amino sugar. In order to determine if an alteration in cortex structure correlates with heat resistance properties, the peptidoglycan structure and properties of B. subtilis spores prepared under different conditions were compared. Peptidoglycan from spores prepared in Nutrient Broth (NB) showed reduction in single L-alanine substituted muramic acid to only 13.9% compared with 20.6% in CCY-grown spores. NB-prepared spores are also unstable, with 161-fold less heat resistance (60 min, 85 degrees C) and 43 times less Mn(2+) content than CCY-grown spores. Addition of MnCl(2) to NB led to a peptidoglycan profile similar to CCY-grown spores, sevenfold more heat resistance (60 min, 85 degrees C) and an 86-fold increase in Mn(2+) content. Addition of CCY salts to NB led all parameters to be comparable with CCY-grown spore levels. CONCLUSION: It has been shown that peptidoglycan structure is conserved in four spore-forming bacteria. Also, spore heat resistance is multifactorial and cannot be accounted for by any single parameter. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Endospores made by diverse species most likely have common mechanisms of heat resistance. However, the molecular basis for their resistance remains elusive.
TI  - Foodborne diseases in Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in Kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Forty two districts in Kenya between 1970 and 1993. STUDY SUBJECTS: Foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. RESULTS: Thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. Foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. A high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. CONCLUSION: Under-reporting, inadequate investigation of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease outbreaks are more than is recorded by the Ministry of Health.
TI  - Research on factors allowing a risk assessment of spore-forming pathogenic bacteria in cooked chilled foods containing vegetables: a FAIR collaborative project.
AB  - Vegetables are frequent ingredients of cooked chilled foods and are frequently contaminated with spore-forming bacteria (SFB). Therefore, risk assessment studies have been carried out, including the following: hazard identification and characterisation--from an extensive literature review and expertise of the participants, B. cereus and C. botulinum were identified as the main hazards; exposure assessment--consisting of determination of the prevalence of hazardous SFB in cooked chilled foods containing vegetables and in unprocessed vegetables, and identification of SFB representative of the bacterial community in cooked chilled foods containing vegetables, determination of heat-resistance parameters and factors affecting heat resistance of SFB, determination of the growth kinetics of SFB in vegetable substrate and of the influence of controlling factors, validation of previous work in complex food systems and by challenge testing and information about process and storage conditions of cooked chilled foods containing vegetables. The paper illustrates some original results obtained in the course of the project. The results and information collected from scientific literature or from the expertise of the participants are integrated into the microbial risk assessment, using both a Bayesian belief network approach and a process risk model approach, previously applied to other foodborne hazards.
TI  - Control of bacterial spores.
AB  - Bacterial spores are much more resistant than their vegetative counterparts. The  most dangerous spore-former is Clostridium botulinum which produces a potent neurotoxin that can prove fatal. The most common food poisoning from a spore-former is caused by C. perfringens. Other food poisoning spore-formers include Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and B. licheniformis. There are a number of non-pathogenic spore-formers including butyric and thermophilic anaerobes that cause significant economic losses to food producers. Some unusual spoilage complaints have been reported, for example, B. sporothermodurans in UHT milk, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris in apple and orange juice and Desulfotomaculum nigrificans in hot vending machines. Control of spore-formers requires an understanding of both the resistance and outgrowth characteristics of the spores.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - Preformed bacterial toxins.
AB  - Food poisoning syndromes caused by four different bacteria are described. For all types, food kept at a permissive temperature allows growth of the vegetative forms of the bacteria and production of a toxin or toxins. The key features of these syndromes, as well as possible new trends of concern, are summarized in Table 1.
TI  - Modelling the overall effect of pH on the apparent heat resistance of Bacillus cereus spores.
AB  - A simple overall model is proposed to describe the effect of both the pH of the heating menstruum and the pH of the recovery medium on the apparent spore heat resistance of Bacillus cereus. Applied to foods making up both heating and recovery media, the model can be reduced to only two parameters. Its goodness of fit and its robustness enable it to be applied to the optimisation of heat treatments. However. further experiments should be undertaken to validate the model for other species and to determine the parameters related to reference species such as Clostridium botulinum.
TI  - Efficacy of oxonia active against selected spore formers.
AB  - Alternatives to hydrogen peroxide are being sought for use in aseptic packaging systems because this sterilant is efficacious at temperatures higher than some of the newer packaging materials can tolerate. Earlier in this century, peracetic acid was known to be bactericidal, sporicidal, and virucidal but was not widely used because of handling, toxicity, and stability problems. Sanitizer suppliers have capitalized on the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and peracetic acid stabilized with a sequestering agent. Formulations have been improved and marketed as Oxonia Active, and its use as an alternative sterilant to hydrogen peroxide merits evaluation. Oxonia was assessed at a concentration of 2% and a temperature of 40 degrees C against a number of spore-forming organisms, including foodborne pathogens. Spores tested in aqueous suspension showed an order of sensitivity (least to greatest) to Oxonia as follows: Bacillus cereus > B. subtilis A > B. stearothermophilus > B. subtilis var. globigii > B. coagulans > Clostridium sporogenes (PA3679) > C. butyricum > C. botulinum type B (nonproteolytic) > C. botulinum type B (proteolytic) = C. botulinum type A = C. botulinum type E. B. subtilis A and B. stearothermophilus spores tested in the dry state were less sensitive to Oxonia than when tested in aqueous suspension. B. cereus, a foodborne pathogen, proved to be markedly less sensitive to Oxonia under the described test conditions. The decreased sensitivity to Oxonia by the foodborne pathogen B. cereus raises concern about the efficacy of the sterilant for aseptic packaging of low-acid foods. Further work will be needed to determine if this decreased sensitivity is an inherent property of the organism that affords unusual protection against Oxonia or if the challenge parameters selected were at the minimum conditions for efficacy.
TI  - A review of analytical methods for the detection of bacterial toxins.
AB  
TI  - Produce handling and processing practices.
AB  - In the past decade, outbreaks of human illness associated with the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits (or unpasteurized products produced from them) have increased in the United States. Changes in agronomic, harvesting, distribution, processing, and consumption patterns and practices have undoubtedly contributed to this increase. Pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, and Bacillus cereus are naturally present in some soil, and their presence on fresh produce is not rare. Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, parasites, and viruses are more likely to contaminate fresh produce through vehicles such as raw or improperly composted manure, irrigation water containing untreated sewage, or contaminated wash water. Contact with mammals, reptiles, fowl, insects, and unpasteurized products of animal origin offers another avenue through which pathogens can access produce. Surfaces, including human hands, which come in contact with whole or cut produce represent potential points of contamination throughout the total system of growing, harvesting, packing, processing, shipping, and preparing produce for consumption. Treatment of produce with chlorinated water reduces populations of pathogenic and other microorganisms on fresh produce but cannot eliminate them. Reduction of risk for human illness associated with raw produce can be better achieved through controlling points of potential contamination in the field; during harvesting; during processing or distribution; or in retail markets, food-service facilities, or the home.
TI  - Probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - DNA-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. In this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of Salmonella, E. coli, V. cholerae, non-O1 Vibrio, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and C. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. In food control, DNA-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of DNA-based methods. The most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - Rho-ADP-ribosylating exoenzyme from Bacillus cereus. Purification, characterization, and identification of the NAD-binding site.
AB  - The ADP-ribosyltransferase produced by a pathogenic strain of Bacillus cereus was purified to near homogeneity. The transferase is a 28,000 Da molecular mass enzyme with a pI of 10.3. The specific enzyme activity is 7.0 nmol of ADP-ribose min-1 mg-1 with a Km for NAD of 0.3 microM. Partial amino acid sequence analysis of the exoenzyme reveals no significant homology to Clostridium botulinum C3 nor to Clostridium limosum exoenzyme. The novel exoenzyme selectively modifies the small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family presumably at the same acceptor amino acid (Asn-41) as determined for C3. Besides cellular Rho, recombinant RhoA and -B are substrates for the exoenzyme. However, recombinant Rac1 and CDC42, although belonging to the Rho family, are not modified. B. cereus exoenzyme was photolabeled with [carbonyl-14C]NAD resulting in inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD-glycohydrolase activity. A glutamic acid residue was identified as part of the NAD-binding site which corresponds to Glu-174 of C3. This glutamic acid is located in a domain which shows high homology with the C-terminal part of C3 exoenzyme, C. limosum exoenzyme, and Staphylococcus aureus EDIN and which probably represents the catalytic site of the transferases. The data indicate that B. cereus exoenzyme is a novel member of the family of C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases which share the same substrate protein Rho and which have an identical highly conserved catalytic domain.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic bacteria in the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Faecal samples from 123 infants who died with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and from a comparative group of 52 age-matched babies were analysed for toxigenic bacteria and their toxins. Serum samples from the SIDS infants were also analysed for these toxins. A significantly higher proportion of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins were found in faecal samples of SIDS babies than in samples from the comparative group. These toxins were also found in serum from the SIDS babies. Clostridium perfringens was found in 54 (45.4%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 10 (19.6%) of 51 healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.1, p < 0.01); C. difficile in 33 (27.7%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 8 (14.8%) of 54 healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.43ns, p < 0.1); Staphylococcus aureus in 12 (27.3%; 66.7% enterotoxigenic) of 44 SIDS cases compared with 12 (85.7%; non-enterotoxigenic) of 14 healthy babies (chi 2 = 14.9, p < 0.001); C. botulinum in 6 (5.0%) of 120 SIDS cases compared with 0 of 53 healthy babies (chi 2 = 2.74, p < 0.1). Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonellae and Bacillus cereus were not detected. Heat-labile toxin, lethal to mice (HLML) was found in 32 (27.1%) of 118 SIDS faecal samples compared with 5 (10.6%) of 47 healthy babies (chi 2 = 5.24, p < 0.05); cytotoxins in 38 (30.9%) of 123 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 21 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 8.8, p < 0.01) and 24 (27.6%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 33 (34.4%) of 96 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 23 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.94, p < 0.001), and in 27 (24.5%) of 110 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens alpha-toxin (presumptive) was detected in 14 (17.5%) of 80 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 17 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.5ns, p congruent to 0.05) and in 2 (2.3%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. difficile toxin was detected in four SIDS faecal samples and two serum samples. C. botulinum toxin was detected in only one of 120 SIDS faecal samples compared with none of 49 from healthy babies. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 19 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 4.278, p < 0.05), and in 4 (10.8%) of 37 SIDS serum samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - ADP-ribosylation of small GTP-binding proteins by Bacillus cereus.
AB  - A human pathogenic strain of Bacillus cereus produces an exoenzyme which selectively ADP-ribosylates 20-25 kDa GTP-binding proteins in platelet membranes. Pre-ADP-ribosylation of rho proteins of human platelet membranes with Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 or Clostridium limosum exoenzyme inhibits subsequent ADP-ribosylation by the exoenzyme from B. cereus indicating similar substrate specificity of the transferases. The ADP-ribosyltransferase from B. cereus reveals no immunological cross-reactivity with C. botulinum C3 and C. limosum exoenzyme.
TI  - Sodium hypophosphite inhibition of the growth of selected gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Sodium hypophosphite (SHP) was evaluated for inhibition of growth of selected Gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria in Trypticase Soy Broth. In addition, the effects of pH and sodium chloride (NaCl) alone and in combination with (SHP) were also examined. All inhibition studies were performed with optimal or nearly optimal growth conditions for each bacterium. Growth was monitored by determining culture optical density at 600 nm, and a time to significant growth determined for each test media. Ratios of time to significant growth for each control over that in test variables were used to evaluate the effect of SHP and other variables on growth. SHP was effective in inhibiting growth of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum strains 62A 52A and Lamanna B, but generally ineffective against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Results from this investigation show that SHP has potential as a food ingredient for the inhibition of certain Gram-positive foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Egg yolk paste for determining some food poisoning bacteria.
AB  - Egg yolk, aseptically prepared from fresh eggs, was partially dehydrated with a 40% high fructose corn syrup solution, and 10% salt was added. This salted yolk paste was added to mannitol salt agar for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus, to NaCl-glycine Kim and Goepfert medium for detection of Bacillus cereus, to Clostridium welchii agar for detection of C. perfringens, and to Gifu anaerobic medium for detection of C. botulinum. These food poisoning bacteria showed the same lecithovitellin (LV) reaction on these media as on the same media prepared with fresh egg yolk. The yolk paste could be stored at -20 C without freezing and did not show any bacterial growth after holding at 25 C for 30 days. The increased salt content resulted from the addition of salted yolk paste to the media did not inhibit the growth of the food poisoning bacteria used in these experiments. For the identification of the food poisoning bacteria used in this work, and which give a LV reaction, salted yolk paste is more convenient to use than yolk separated from fresh shell eggs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  - Egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including Listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. We also found that the food spoilage thermophile Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme and confirmed that the spoilage organisms Bacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. Several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. The results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Tailing of survivor curves of clostridial spores heated in edible oils.
AB  - Tailing of survivor curves was observed for Clostridium sporogenes PA 3679 and Cl. botulinum 62A spores heated whilst suspended in edible oils, but not for the same spores suspended in buffer (pH 7.2) or mineral oil or for Bacillus cereus F4165/75 spores suspended in buffer or oils. The tailing cannot be ascribed to a genetic or developmental heterogeneity in the resistance of the spore population or to a heterogeneity of the treatment severity during heating. Heat adaptation due to the release of protective factor(s), to the selection for resistant spores or to the diffusion of oil constituents inside the spore protoplast to protect key molecules from heat denaturation was also ruled out. The tailing can be ascribed to spore clumping during the course of heating or to a heterogeneity in heat resistance of germination system(s) within spores, concurrently with the activation of a dormant germination system. It is probably caused by some oleic acid containing triglycerides.
TI  - Effect of thermal treatments in oils on bacterial spore survival.
AB  - The heat resistance of Bacillus cereus F4165/75, Clostridium sporogenes PA 3679 and Cl. botulinum 62A spores suspended in buffer (pH 7.2), olive oil and a commercial oil (a mixture of rapeseed oil and soy oil) was investigated. Linear survivor curves were obtained with B. cereus spores in the three menstrua and with 62A and PA 3679 spores suspended in buffer. However, the inactivation kinetics of the clostridial spores suspended in oils were concave upward with a characteristic tailing-off for 62A spores suspended in olive oil. These deviations from the semi-log model could not be ascribed to a heterogeneity in heat resistance of the spore population or to the variation of aw during heating. Spore resistance to heat increased in the order: buffer much less than commercial oil less than olive oil. The greater heat resistance of oil-suspended spores was ascribed to the low aw (0.479 and 0.492 for commercial oil and olive oil, respectively) and to the composition of the oils. The difference in z values (ca 28 degrees C in oils and 10 degrees-12 degrees C in buffer) suggested that the mechanism of inactivation differs for spores suspended in lipids and in aqueous systems. The thermodynamic data were consistent with this hypothesis.
TI  - [Effect of components of curing mixtures on the antagonistic properties of enterococci and other bacteria isolated from cured meat].
AB  - Effect of sodium chloride, glucose, sodium glutamate, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, sodium nitraite, ascorbic acid, sodium citrate, polyphosphates (Hamine) on antagonistic activity of enterococci and various bacteria isolated from cured meat against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi-murium, Salmonella cholerae-suis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium botulinum type A, Clostridium botulinum type B, Clostridium botulinum type E, Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium perfringens type A, Clostridium sporogenes. It was found that some of the chemical compounds examined increased the antagonistic effect and other compounds partly or totally inhibited it. Sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, glucose, and ascorbic acid in majority of cases increased antagonism and sodium citrate and polyphosphates restrained this phenomenon.
TI  - Multiple modes of inhibition of spore germination and outgrowth by reduced pH and sorbate.
AB  - Germination and outgrowth of three strains of Clostridium botulinum in PYEG medium were measured by phase contrast microscopy. Reduction in pH from 7 to 5.5 completely inhibited germination of strain 12885A, reduced the extent of germination of strain 62A and had no effect on the extent of germination of strain 53B. At pH 5.5, 225 mg/l of undissociated sorbic acid had no effect on the germination of strain 53B, while at pH 6.5, 225 mg/l of undissociated sorbic acid completely inhibited germination of strains 62A and 12885A. Outgrowth of germinated spores of strains 62A and 53B was not inhibited at pH 5.5, but the addition of sorbate (225 mg/l undissociated sorbic acid) completely inhibited outgrowth. Sorbate inhibited germination of Cl. botulinum and Bacillus cereus spores triggered to germinate by amino acids. Inhibition occurred after germinant binding, as measured by commitment to germinate.
TI  - Inhibition of germinant binding by bacterial spores in acidic environments.
AB  - Commitment to germinate occurred in both Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus cereus spores during 0.5 min of exposure to 100 mM L-alanine or L-cysteine, measured by the inability of germination inhibitors (D form of amino acid) to inhibit germination. Spore germination at pH 4.5 was inhibited because the germinant did not bind to the trigger sites. C. botulinum spores exposed to 100 mM L-alanine or L-cysteine at pH 4.5 remained sensitive to D-amino acid inhibition at pH 7, indicating that no germinants had bound to the trigger site at pH 4.5. Inhibition of germinant binding at pH 4.5 was reversible but lagged in commitment to germinate upon transfer to pH 7. Spores sequentially exposed to pH 4.5 buffer and pH 7 buffer with the germinant also demonstrated a lag in commitment to germinate. The pH at which binding was inhibited was not significantly affected by composition of the buffer or by reduced germinant concentrations (10 mM). Nonspecific uptake of L-[3H]alanine by C. botulinum spores was not inhibited at pH 4.5. Inhibition of germinant binding in acidic environments appeared to be due to protonation of a functional group in or near the trigger site. This may represent a general mechanism for inhibition of spore germination in acidic environments.
TI  - Bacterial food poisoning: what to do if prevention fails.
AB  - The numerous etiologies of food poisoning make assessment of this disease a cultural, bacteriologic, chemical, gastronomic, and epidemiologic research project. Cautious investigation and study of etiologic possibilities are most stimulating intellectual exercises and obviously benefit the patient. Often, a case of food poisoning necessitates interaction with the local health department in search of the causative agent before other people are afflicted. A thorough knowledge of this field is essential to provide reasonable care to the millions "poisoned" by food annually.
TI  - Mechanisms of sorbate inhibition of Bacillus cereus T and Clostridium botulinum 62A spore germination.
AB  - The mechanism by which potassium sorbate inhibits Bacillus cereus T and Clostridium botulinum 62A spore germination was investigated. Spores of B. cereus T were germinated at 35 degrees C in 0.08 M sodium-potassium phosphate buffers (pH 5.7 and 6.7) containing various germinants (L-alanine, L-alpha-NH2-n-butyric acid, and inosine) and potassium sorbate. Spores of C. botulinum 62A were germinated in the same buffers but with 10 mM L-lactic acid, 20 mM sodium bicarbonate, L-alanine or L-cysteine, and potassium sorbate. Spore germination was monitored by optical density measurements at 600 nm and phase-contrast microscopy. Inhibition of B. cereus T spore germination was observed when 3,900 micrograms of potassium sorbate per ml was added at various time intervals during the first 2 min of spore exposure to the pH 5.7 germination medium. C. botulinum 62A spore germination was inhibited when 5,200 micrograms of potassium sorbate per ml was added during the first 30 min of spore exposure to the pH 5.7 medium. Potassium sorbate inhibition of germination was reversible for both B. cereus T and C. botulinum 62A spores. Potassium sorbate inhibition of B. cereus T spore germination induced by L-alanine and L-alpha-NH2-n-butyric acid was shown to be competitive in nature. Potassium sorbate was also a competitive inhibitor of L-alanine- and L-cysteine-induced germination of C. botulinum 62A spores.
TI  - Immunological detection of food-poisoning toxins.
AB  
TI  - Foodborne hazards of microbial origin.
AB  - Foods can serve as vehicles of many pathogenic and toxigenic agents of disease. Bacterial agents comprise three groups: 1) those that grow in the food and produce an active toxin before consumption (e.g., clostridium botulinium); 2) those that merely exist as contaminants in the food but are able to initiate infection when swallowed (e.g., Salmonella spp.); and 3) those that multiply and produce large numbers of vegetative cells in the food, then release an active enterotoxin when they sporulate in the gut. A few parasitic (e.g., Trichinella spiralis) and viral agents (e.g., hepatitis A) also can be transmitted by food. Botulinum poisoning is the deadliest foodborne disease. The potential danger of botulism from cured meats is a major factor in the argument over use of nitrites as meat curing agents. A new disease called infant botulism has been recognized since 1976. Apparently it is not foodborne but results from intraintestinal growth of C. botulinum in very young infants. Salmonellosis is the most important of the foodborne diseases from the standpoint of overall human health. The primary vehicles are contaminated raw meat, poultry, and eggs. Faulty food handling practices are responsible for most food poisoning in the United States.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of foodborne diseases.
AB  - Many bacterial species are responsible for sporadic cases and outbreaks of foodborne intoxication and infection. The foodborne diseases are classified on the basis of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved into four categories: performed toxin, enterotoxin formed in the colonized small intestine, mucosal invasion (enterocolitis) and mucosal invasion with bacteremia. Invasive and toxigenic strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli are discussed. In vivo test systems for the identification of enterotoxigenic organisms and tissue culture assays for the heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli are described. Current laboratory methods for the diagnosis of foodborne diseases of major public health interest are reviewed - botulism, staphylococcal intoxication, Clostridium perfringens enteritis, salmonellosis, enteropathogenic E. coli infection, Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection and Bacillus cereus enteritis. The role of the laboratory in the epidemiologic surveillance and investigation of foodborne diseases is emphasized.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium botulinum by strains of Clostridium perfringens isolated from soil.
AB  - Thirty-one soil samples were examined for the presence of organisms capable of inhibiting growth and toxin production of strains of Clostridium botulinum type A. Such organisms were found in eight samples of soil. Inhibiting strains of C. perfringens were found in five samples, of C. sporogenes in three and of Bacillus cereus in three. Three of the C. perfringens strains produced an inhibitor effective on all 11 strains of C. botulinum type A against which they were tested, seven of eight proteolytic type B strains, one nonproteolytic type B strain, five of nine type E strains and all seven type F strains, whether proteolytic or nonproteolytic. They did not inhibit any of 26 type C strains, 6 type D strains, 4 type E strains, or 24 C. sporogenes strains. In mixed culture, an inhibitor strain of C. perfringens repressed growth and toxin production by a C. botulinum type A strain even though it was outnumbered by the latter about 40 times. It also repressed growth and toxin production of C. botulinum in mixed culture of soils in which this latter organism naturally occurred when cooked meat medium but not when trypticase medium was used.

TI  - Location of bacterial polysaccharide during various phases of growth.
AB  - Polysaccharide-containing material was located by histochemical staining on ultrathin sections of Bacillus cereus and several clostridial species during various phases of growth. These components were located along the cell wall in young vegetative cells and along the developing cortex in sporulating cells. In B. cereus any carbohydrate-containing material present along the forespore membrane was too small to be detected by direct staining. However, in three clostridial species such material was detected at all stages of forespore development.
TI  - Effect of lipid materials on heat resistance of bacterial spores.
AB  - The apparent heat resistance of spores of Bacillus megaterium, B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. stearothermophilus, and Clostridium botulinum type E in lipids was investigated and compared with the resistance of the spores in phosphate buffer solution. The most pronounced increase in heat resistance was noted for B. subtilis and C. botulinum type E, the increase varying with the type of lipid used. A high water content of the lipids used as heating menstruum lowered the heat resistance of the spores. Possible explanations for the high heat resistance of spores in lipids are discussed.
TI  - Food-borne bacterial toxins.
AB  - Food poisoning caused by the ingestion of preformed bacterial toxins is considered in relation to comparative symptoms, procedures for extraction and purification of the causal toxins, their chemistry, serology, assay procedures and pharmacology, in so far as these are known.The bacteria discussed in this context are Clostridium botulinum, C. perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Vibrio parahemolyticus. The possible roles of the enterococci, Proteus, E. coli and of unknown species, in relation to production of non-antigenic toxic substances, are discussed briefly.Requirements for prevention of the various forms of bacterial food poisoning are outlined.
