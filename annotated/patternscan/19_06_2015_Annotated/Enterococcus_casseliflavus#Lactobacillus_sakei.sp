TI  == isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == lactobacillus pobuzihii is a novel species which has been previously found in pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in taiwan. however, the lactic acid bacteria (lab) microflora in pobuzihi has not been studied in detail. in this study, lab from pobuzihi were isolated, identified, and characterized. a total of 196 lab were isolated; 79 cultures were isolated from the sample collected from a manufacturing factory, 38 from pobuzihi samples  collected from 4 different markets, and 79 from 2 fresh cummingcordia samples. these isolates were characterized phenotypically and then divided into eight groups (a to h) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant lab found in most samples during the fermentation of pobuzihi. on the other hand, enterococcus casseliflavus and weissella cibaria were, respectively, the major species found in the two fresh cummingcordia samples. a potential novel species or subspecies of lactococcal strain was found. in addition, seven l. plantarum and five w. cibaria strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t). this is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of lab existing in the pobuzihi during its fermentation process and the final product on the market.

TI  == isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from jiang-gua (fermented  cucumbers), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == background: jiang-gua (fermented cucumbers) is a popular traditional fermented food in taiwan. the microflora of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in jiang-gua have not been investigated in detail. in this study, lab from jiang-gua were isolated, characterised and identified. results: a total of 103 lab were isolated; 70 cultures were isolated from jiang-gua samples and 33 cultures were isolated from  its raw substrate, cucumber. these isolates were mainly characterised phenotypically and then divided into seven groups (a-g) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. the isolates were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus, leuconostoc lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, weissella cibaria and weissella  hellenica. the antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined and 11 lc. lactis subsp. lactis strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t) . conclusion: heterofermentative w. cibaria and leu. lactis were the major lab found in jiang-gua samples without soy sauce. in soy sauce-added samples, homofermentative l. pentosus and l. plantarum  were the most abundant lab. in addition, the results also suggested that hhai and rsai restriction enzymes could be applied to distinguish w. hellenica and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == study of the ecology of fresh sausages and characterization of populations of lactic acid bacteria by molecular methods.
AB  == in this study, a polyphasic approach was used to study the ecology of fresh sausages and to characterize populations of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the microbial profile of fresh sausages was monitored from the production day to the  10th day of storage at 4 degrees c. samples were collected on days 0, 3, 6, and 10, and culture-dependent and -independent methods of detection and identification were applied. traditional plating and isolation of lab strains, which were subsequently identified by molecular methods, and the application of pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to dna and rna extracted directly from the fresh sausage samples allowed the study in detail of the changes in the bacterial and yeast populations during storage. brochothrix thermosphacta and lactobacillus sakei were the main populations present. in particular, b. thermosphacta was present throughout the process, as determined by both dna and rna analysis. other bacterial species, mainly staphylococcus xylosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and l. curvatus, were detected by dgge. moreover, an uncultured bacterium and an uncultured staphylococcus sp. were present, too. lab strains isolated at day 0 were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. casei, and enterococcus casseliflavus, and on day 3 a strain of leuconostoc mesenteroides was identified. the remaining strains isolated belonged to l. sakei. concerning the yeast ecology, only debaryomyces hansenii was established in the fresh sausages. capronia mansonii was initially present, but it was not detected after the first 3 days. at last, l. sakei isolates were characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic dna pcr and repetitive dna element pcr. the results obtained underlined how different populations took over  at different steps of the process. this is believed to be the result of the selection of the particular population, possibly due to the low storage temperature employed.
