TI  == streptococcus pneumoniae: the forgotten microorganism in neonatal sepsis.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a rarely cause of neonatal sepsis. its prevalence is  low but with a mortality of 50%. measures to prevent streptococcus agalactiae transmission could help to increase invasive pneumococcal disease (ipd) in newborns. transmission could be from mother intrapartum; or in those cases of late onset sepsis, the community carriers. systematic vaccination with pcv-7 and  pcv-13 has reduced ipd rates. we present a case of a newborn with no perinatal risk factors for infection. in the first 24 hours after surgery of an ovarian cyst, the patient started with bad general condition with fever and regular perfusion. empiric antibiotic treatment was started. streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in blood culture. conclusion: in neonatal sepsis, we always think in streptococcus agalactiae. streptococcus pneumoniae is rare but with a high morbidity and mortality. systematic vaccination is a measure that has demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease.

TI  == [analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  == objective: to study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. method: a retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of yuying children's hospital of wenzhou medical university seen from january 1, 2004 to december 31, 2013. the clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. result: among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). in 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were gram-negative bacteria. the five most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%),  coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns, 20 cases, 17.9%), streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%),  staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. escherichia coli was the most common  bacterium, followed by streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, p < 0.05). klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, p < 0.05). streptococcus (most were streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset  meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, p < 0.05). drug sensitivity tests showed that all the gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. staphylococci were  resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of cns isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. no streptococcus and enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. none of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. among the gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. there were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by streptococcus died. conclusion:  escherichia coli, cns and streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. there were increasing numbers of cases with streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.

TI  == heart transplantation as salvage treatment of intractable infective endocarditis.
AB  == this study reports six consecutive patients who underwent heart transplantation as salvage treatment for endocarditis (duke criteria) with extensive perivalvular lesions and end-stage heart failure. the median age was 45 years (range, 24 to 64), and the aortic valve was affected in all patients. pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1), or not documented (n = 1). all patients survived, with no relapse, after a median follow-up of 24.5 months. the 10 patients with heart transplantation for endocarditis previously reported also survived (median follow-up, 27.5 months). heart transplantation may be considered as salvage treatment in selected patients with intractable infective endocarditis.

TI  == transduction of the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(a) and tet(o), to other streptococcus species.
AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) grown in r. macedonia.
AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == prevalence and predictors of bacterial meningitis in young infants with fever without a source.
AB  == background: classical criteria differ when performing cerebrospinal fluid (csf) analysis in infants younger than 90 days with fever without a source (fws). our objectives were to analyze the prevalence and microbiology of bacterial meningitis in this group and its prevalence in relation to clinical and laboratory risk factors. methods: this is a substudy of a prospective registry including all infants of this age with fws seen between september 2003 and august 2013 in a pediatric emergency department of a tertiary teaching hospital. results: lumbar puncture was performed in 639 (27.0%) of the 2362 infants with fws seen, the rate being higher in not well-appearing infants [60.9% vs. 25.7%; odds ratio (or), 4.49] and in those </=21 days old (70.1% vs. 20.4%; or, 9.14). eleven infants were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis: 9 were </=21 days old (prevalence 2.8% vs. 0.1%; or, 30.42) and 5 were not well-appearing infants (5.7% vs. 0.2%; or, 23.06). bacteria isolated were streptococcus agalactiae (3), escherichia coli (3), listeria monocytogenes (3), streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and neisseria meningitidis (1). none of the 1975 well-appearing infants >21 days  old were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, regardless of whether biomarkers were altered. conclusions: in infants younger than 90 days with fws, performing csf analysis for ruling out bacterial meningitis must be strongly considered in not well-appearing infants and in those </=21 days old. the recommendation of systematically performing csf analysis in well-appearing infants 22-90 days of age on the basis of analytical criteria alone must be reevaluated.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  == introduction: ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella oxytoca, k. pneumoniae and moraxella catarrhalis. it is currently approved by the fda for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp) in adults. areas covered: this review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for absssi and cabp; and adverse effects. expert opinion: ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant gram-positive organisms and select gram-negative pathogens. the pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. there is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been  published in a small series of case reports. randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.

TI  == bacteremia in previously healthy children in emergency departments: clinical and  microbiological characteristics and outcome.
AB  == a blood culture (bc) is frequently requested in both patients with a suspected occult bacteremia/invasive infection as well as those with certain focal infections. few data are available on the characteristics of patients in whom a bacteremia is identified in the pediatric emergency department (ped). a prospective multicenter registry was established by the spanish pediatric emergency society. epidemiological data, complementary test results, clinical management, and final outcome were recorded. data from the first three years of the registry were analyzed. a true bacterial pathogen grew in 932 of 65,169 bcs collected [1.43 %; 95 % confidence interval (ci) 1.34-1.51 %], with 711 of them collected in patients without previously known bacteremia risk factors. among them, 335 (47.1 %) were younger than 1 year old and 467 (65.7 %) had a normal pediatric assessment triangle (pat) on admission. overall, the most frequently isolated bacterial species was streptococcus pneumoniae (27.3 %; 47.6 % among patients with an altered pat). the main pathogens were escherichia coli (40.3 %)  and s. agalactiae (35.7 %) among patients younger than 3 months, s. pneumoniae among patients 3-60 months old (40.0 %), and s. aureus (31.9 %) among patients over 60 months of age. neisseria meningitidis was the leading cause of sepsis in  patients older than 3 months. eight patients died; none of them had a pneumococcal bacteremia and all had abnormal pat findings on admission. s. pneumoniae is the main cause of bacteremia in patients without bacteremia risk factors who attended spanish peds. age and general appearance influence the frequency of each bacterial species. general appearance also influences the associated mortality.

TI  == comparative study of bacteriological culture and real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) hybridization assay in the diagnosis of bacterial neonatal meningitis.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis is more common in the neonatal period than any other time in life; however, it is still a challenge for the evidence based diagnosis. strategy for identification of neonatal bacterial meningitis pathogens is presented by evaluating three different available methods to establish evidence-based diagnosis for neonatal bacterial meningitis. methods: the cerebrospinal fluid samples from 56 neonates diagnosed as bacterial meningitis in 2009 in beijing children's hospital were analyzed in the study. two pcr based molecular assays, real-time fluorescence quantitative pcr (rt-pcr) and multiplex  pcr based-reverse line blot hybridization (mpcr/rlb), were used to assess 7 common neonatal meningitis bacterial pathongens, including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, listerisa monocytogenes, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae. the findings in examinations of two assays were compared with the results obtained bacterial culture tests. results: bacterial meningitis was identified in five cases (9%) by csf cultures, 25 (45%) by rt-pcr and 16 (29%) by mpcr/rlb. one strain of s. epidermidis and one of e. faecalis were identified using mpcr/rlb but not by rt-pcr. in contrast, cultures identified one strain of s. pneumoniae which was missed by both pcr assays. overall, the bacterial pathogens in 28 cases were identified with these three methods. both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays were more sensitive than bacterial culture, (p < 0.05). conclusion: our study confirmed that both rt-pcr and mpcr/rlb assays have better sensitivity than bacterial culture. they are capable of detecting the pathogens in csf samples with negative culture results.

TI  == subterfuge and sabotage: evasion of host innate defenses by invasive gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the development of a severe invasive bacterial infection in an otherwise healthy  individual is one of the most striking and fascinating aspects of human medicine. a small cadre of gram-positive pathogens of the genera streptococcus and staphylococcus stand out for their unique invasive disease potential and sophisticated ability to counteract the multifaceted components of human innate defense. this review illustrates how these leading human disease agents evade host complement deposition and activation, impede phagocyte recruitment and activation, resist the microbicidal activities of host antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, escape neutrophil extracellular traps, and promote and accelerate phagocyte cell death through the action of pore-forming cytolysins. understanding the molecular basis of bacterial innate immune resistance can open  new avenues for therapeutic intervention geared to disabling specific virulence factors and resensitizing the pathogen to host innate immune clearance.

TI  == establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the food and drug administration safety and innovation act. final rule.
AB  == the food and drug administration (fda or agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. this final rule implements a provision of the generating antibiotic incentives now (gain) title of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act (fdasia). gain is intended to encourage  development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of  exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, fda has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' acinetobacter species, aspergillus species, burkholderia cepacia complex, campylobacter species, candida species, clostridium difficile, coccidioides species, cryptococcus species, enterobacteriaceae (e.g.,  klebsiella pneumoniae), enterococcus species, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium  tuberculosis complex, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, pseudomonas species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and vibrio cholerae. the preamble to the  proposed rule described the factors the agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. as described in the preamble of this final rule, fda applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.

TI  == recent trends in pediatric bacterial meningitis in japan--a country where haemophilus influenzae type b and streptococcus pneumoniae conjugated vaccines have just been introduced.
AB  == to investigate the trends in incidence and the characteristics of bacterial meningitis in japan where haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) vaccine and 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (pcv7) were introduced in 2008 and 2010, respectively, which was 5-20 years after their introduction in western countries. the nationwide japanese survey of pediatric and neonatal bacterial meningitis was performed in 2011 and 2012. we analyzed the epidemiological and clinical data, and compared the information obtained in the previous nationwide survey database. we also investigated the risk factors for disease outcome. in the 2011-2012 surveys, 357 patients were evaluated. h. influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and escherichia coli were the main organisms. the number of patients hospitalized with bacterial meningitis per 1000 admissions decreased  from 1.31 in 2009 to 0.43 in 2012 (p < 0.001). the incidence of h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae meningitis also decreased from 0.66 to 0.08 (p < 0.001), and 0.30 to 0.06 (p < 0.001), respectively. only 0-2 cases with neisseria meningitidis were reported each year throughout 2001-2012. the median patient age was 10-12 months in 2001-2011, and became lower in 2012 (2 month old) (p < 0.001). the fatality rate for s. agalactiae is the highest (5.9% (11/187)) throughout 2001-2012 among the four organisms. risk factors for death and sequelae were convulsions at onset, low csf glucose, s. agalactiae etiology, and persistent positive csf culture. hib vaccine and pcv7 decreased the rate of bacterial meningitis. earlier introduction of these vaccines may have prevented bacterial meningitis among japanese children.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

AB  == background: meningitis remains one of the most feared infectious diseases worldwide, yet there are few population-based studies on the epidemiology, causes, or trends over time in meningitis, especially in industrialised countries. our aim was to do such a study using routinely reported data available in england and wales. methods: in england and wales, uk national health service hospitals routinely report laboratory-confirmed pathogens electronically to public health england. records of all positive bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal results from cerebrospinal fluid or from blood cultures in patients with clinical meningitis were extracted for analysis. the percentage change in annual  incidence was estimated using linear regression analysis of the log of the annual incidence. findings: during 2004-11, 7061 cases of meningitis were reported (mean annual incidence 1.62 per 100,000 people, 95% ci 1.58-1.66), including 2594 cases in children (37%). the incidence of bacterial (1.44 per 100,000 people, 1.41-1.48), fungal (0.09, 0.08-0.10), and mycobacterial (0.09, 0.08-0.09) meningitis remained stable overall and across the age groups, apart from significant year-on-year increases in children younger than 3 months (978 cases;  incidence 72.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 7.4%, 5.1-9.8; p<0.0001) driven mainly by group b streptococci (gbs), and in adults aged 65 years or older (752 cases; incidence 1.2 per 100,000 people; annual increase 3.0%, 1.4-4.8; p<0.0001) primarily because of escherichia coli. by contrast, meningococcal meningitis rates declined steadily, but remained the most common cause of meningitis in children. overall, five groups of bacteria accounted for 60% (3790/6286) of bacterial meningitis cases: neisseria meningitidis (1350 cases, 22%), streptococcus pneumoniae (1143, 18%), staphylococcus aureus (652, 10%), gbs (326, 5%), and e coli (319, 5%). interpretation: in england and wales, laboratory-based surveillance shows a remarkably stable incidence of bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial meningitis in recent years, although there were differences in individual trends among the main pathogens causing meningitis in different age groups. funding: none.

TI  == cardiopulmonary morbidity of streptococcal infections in a picu.
AB  == aim: the streptococci are important bacteria that cause serious childhood infections. we investigated cardiopulmonary morbidity associated with streptococcal infection and pediatric intensive care unit (picu) admission. methods: a retrospective study between 2002 and 2013 of all children with a laboratory isolation of streptococcus. results: there were 40 (2.3%) picu patients with streptococcal isolations including streptococcus pyogenes (group a  streptococcus, gas, n = 7), streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus, gbs, n = 5), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp, n = 20), alpha-hemolytic (n = 4), beta-hemolytic (n = 2) and gama-hemolytic (n = 2) streptococci. comparing among gas, gbs and sp, respiratory isolates were more likely positive for gas or sp (p  = 0.033), whereas cerebrospinal fluid was more likely positive for gbs (p = 0.002). all gas and gbs, and the majority of sp (90%) were sensitive to penicillin. all sp specimens were sensitive to cefotaxime and vancomycin. these infections were associated with high picu mortality of 43%, 20% and 25%, respectively. isolation of streptococci was associated with a 30% mortality and high rates of need for mechanical ventilatory and inotropic supports. patients with gas, sp or any streptococcal isolation had relative risks [95% confidence interval (ci), p value] of picu deaths of 7.5 (ci 3.1-18.1, p < 0.0001), 4.5 (ci  2.0-9.8, p < 0.0002) and 5.7 (ci 3.4-9.5, p < 0.0001), respectively. in sp, older children had significantly higher prevalence of premorbid conditions such as malignancy, mental retardation/cerebral palsy +/- seizure disorders, chromosomal  or genetic disorders (p = 0.003) than children <5 years of age. serotypes were available for some of these specimens that included 19a, 6b, 3 and 6c. there were four sp deaths with multiorgan system failure and hemolytic uremic syndrome (two  19a and two serotype 3). conclusions: severe streptococcal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality despite treatment with systemic antibiotics and intensive care unit support. gas and sp affect the lungs of children, whereas gbs more likely causes meningitis in infants. the expanded coverage of newer polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines can probably prevent infections by serotypes 19a, 19f, 6b and 3.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in malawian infants <2 months of age: etiology and susceptibility to world health organization first-line antibiotics.
AB  == background: neonatal meningitis is an important cause of morbidity in sub-saharan africa and requires urgent empiric treatment with parenteral administered antibiotics. here we describe the etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility and suitability of the world health organization first-line recommended antibiotics (penicillin and gentamicin) for bacterial meningitis in young infants in malawi.  methods: we reviewed all cerebrospinal fluid samples received from infants </=2 months of age with clinically suspected meningitis between january 1, 2002, and december 31, 2008, at the queen elizabeth central hospital in blantyre, malawi. results: we identified 259 culture-positive isolates from 259 infants </=2 months of age. sixty isolates were from neonates </=7 days old, in whom the most common  pathogens were group b streptococcus (27/60; 45.0%), streptococcus pneumoniae (13/60; 21.7%) and nontyphoidal salmonella enterica (7/60; 11.7%). one hundred and ninety one isolates were from young infants who were >7 days and </=2 months  of age. in this group, the most common isolates were s. pneumoniae (80/191; 41.9%), group b streptococcus (38/191; 19.9%) and nontyphoidal salmonella enterica (34/191; 17.8%). more isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone than to the combination of penicillin and gentamicin (218/220; 99.1% vs. 202/220; 91.8%,  fisher's exact test p = 0.006). in particular, gram-negative isolates were significantly more susceptible to ceftriaxone than to gentamicin (72/74; 97.3% vs. 63/74; 85.1%, fisher's exact test p = 0.020). penicillin and gentamicin provided less coverage for gram-negative than gram-positive isolates (74/86; 86.0% vs. 155/163; 95.1%, chi = 6.24, p = 0.012). conclusions: in view of these results, the world health organization recommendations for empiric penicillin and gentamicin for suspected neonatal meningitis should be reevaluated.

TI  == [rapid identification of meningitis due to bacterial pathogens].
AB  == we constructed a new real-time pcr method to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) from patient due to bacterial meningitis. the eight pathogens targeted in the pcr are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aurues, neisseria meningitides, listeria monocytogenes, esherichia coli, and mycoplasma pneumoniae. the total time from dna extraction from csf to pcr analysis was 1.5 hour. the pathogens were detected in 72% of the csf samples (n=115) by real-time pcr, but in only 48% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. the detection rate of pathogens with pcr was significantly better than that with  cultures in patients with antibiotic administration.in conclusion, detection with real-time pcr is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.

TI  == epidemiology of bacteremia in febrile infants in the united states.
AB  == background: fever in infants is a common clinical dilemma. the objective of this  study was to present data from hospital systems across the northeast, southeast,  mid-west, and western united states to identify the pathogens causing bacteremia  in febrile infants admitted to general care units. methods: this was a retrospective review of positive blood culture results in febrile infants aged </=90 days admitted to a general care unit across 6 hospital systems. data were collected from january 1, 2006 through december 31, 2012 from emergency departments and general inpatient units. cultures from icus, central lines, or infants who had complex comorbidities were excluded, as were repeat cultures positive for the same bacteria. common contaminants were considered pathogens if  they were treated as such. results: we identified 181 cases of bacteremia in 177  infants. the most common pathogen was escherichia coli (42%), followed by group b streptococcus (23%). streptococcus pneumoniae was more likely in older infants (p = .01). non-low-risk bacteremic infants were more likely to have e. coli or group b streptococcus than low-risk bacteremic infants. we identified no cases of listeria monocytogenes. variation between sites was minimal. conclusions: this is the largest and most geographically diverse study to date examining the epidemiology of bacteremia in infants. we suggest e. coli is the most common cause of bacteremia in previously healthy febrile infants admitted to a general inpatient unit. we identified no cases of l monocytogenes and question whether empirical therapy remains necessary for this pathogen.

TI  == superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the bactec peds plus/f  system compared to the bact/alert pediatric fan blood culture system.
AB  == here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (ttd) of bact/alert pediatric fan (pf) and bactec peds plus blood culture bottles. test bottles were  inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 cfu/ml. the control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. the organism-drug combinations were staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, streptococcus  agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. the control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. the bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the pf and peds plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. no bacteria were recovered from the bottles with s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, e. coli, n. meningitidis, or h. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. the peds plus system detected p. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the pf system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. the mean ttd were shorter in the peds plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; p = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; p = 0.008) than in the pf bottles. overall, we demonstrated  superior sensitivity, ttd, and antibiotic neutralization in the bactec peds plus  system compared to those in the pediatric fan system.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in children in iceland, 1975-2010: a nationwide epidemiological study.
AB  == background: bacterial meningitis is a serious and potentially rapid life-threatening disease. therefore, to ensure appropriate treatment, early recognition of signs and symptoms is imperative, along with knowledge of the epidemiology and microbiology of the disease. methods: a long-term, nationwide epidemiological study of bacterial causes of meningitis in children (</= 18 y) in iceland during the period 1975-2010 was carried out. a detailed chart review was  performed of all cases diagnosed in 1995-2010. results: a total of 477 children were diagnosed with bacterial meningitis during the period 1975-2010. of these, 67% were aged under 5 y. the most common pathogens were neisseria meningitidis (n = 265), haemophilus influenzae (n = 132), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 47), and  streptococcus agalactiae (n = 19); their incidences varied according to age. the  age-specific incidence (cases/100,000/y) dropped from 26 in 1975 to 1 in 2010 (p  < 0.001). the most common symptoms during the period 1995-2010 were fever (92%),  vomiting (67%), nuchal rigidity (60%), and rashes/petechiae (51%). h. influenzae  type b disappeared following implementation of hib vaccination in 1989, and, likewise, the incidence of meningococcal meningitis fell significantly after vaccination against meningococcus serogroup c was initiated in 2002 (p < 0.001).  the overall 30-day case fatality rate of bacterial meningitis was 4.4% and remained unchanged during the study period. conclusions: the incidence of childhood bacterial meningitis has been reduced significantly by successful vaccinations against h. influenzae type b and n. meningitidis serogroup c. nevertheless, the case fatality rate has remained unchanged and thus the disease  is still a serious threat to childhood health. further prevention by novel vaccines and improved management of childhood meningitis is an exciting challenge.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == prospective survey of acute osteoarticular infections in a french paediatric orthopedic surgery unit.
AB  == the epidemiology of acute paediatric osteoarticular infections (oai) has recently evolved, mainly due to the improvement of microbiological diagnosis. we conducted a prospective study to analyse the recent epidemiology and the clinical evolution of paediatric oai in order to validate the adequacy of our probabilistic first-line antibiotic treatment (intraveinous cefamandole + gentamicin). all children suspected of community acquired oai were included and followed-up for 3  years. the etiologic diagnosis was based on blood cultures, joint aspirations and bone punctures. all osteoarticular (oa) samples were systematically inoculated into blood culture bottles. real-time universal 16s rrna and pcr targeted on staphylococcus aureus, kingella kingae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were performed twice a week. from 17 march 2007 to 26 february 2009, 98 septic arthritis, 70 osteomyelitis, 23 osteoarthritis and six spondylodiscitis were analysed. a portal of entry was suspected in 44% of cases,  including 55% of otorhinolaryngological infections. c reactive protein was the most sensitive inflammatory marker. pcr increased by 54% the performance of bacteriological diagnosis. among the patients completely investigated (blood culture and oai samples), there were 63% documented oai. the main pathogens found were k. kingae (52%), s. aureus (28%), s. pyogenes (7%), s. pneumoniae (3%) and streptococcus agalactiae (2%). all isolated bacteria were sensitive to the probabilist treatment and outcome was favorable. pcr has significantly improved the performance and the delay of ioa diagnosis in children, for which k. kingae turned out to be the first causative agent. the probabilistic treatment was active against the main bacteria responsible for paediatric oai.

TI  == noncovalent association of protein and capsular polysaccharide on bacteria-sized  latex beads as a model for polysaccharide-specific humoral immunity to intact gram-positive extracellular bacteria.
AB  == intact streptococcus pneumoniae expressing type 14 capsular polysaccharide (pps14) and type iii s. agalactiae containing a pps14 core capsule identical to pps14 exhibit noncovalent associations of pps14 and bacterial protein, in contrast to soluble covalent conjugates of these respective ags. both bacteria and conjugates induce murine pps14-specific igg responses dependent on cd4(+) t cells. further, secondary immunization with conjugate and s. agalactiae, although not s. pneumoniae, results in a boosted response. however, in contrast to conjugate, pps14-specific igg responses to bacteria lack affinity maturation use  the 44.1-idiotype and are dependent on marginal zone b cells. to better understand the mechanism underlying this dichotomy, we developed a minimal model  of intact bacteria in which pps14 and pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) were  stably attached to 1 mum (bacteria-sized) latex beads, but not directly linked to each other, in contrast to pps14-pspa conjugate. beads coated simultaneously with pps14+[pspa], similar to conjugate, induced in mice boosted pps14-specific igg secondary responses, dependent on t cells and icos-dependent costimulation, and in which priming could be achieved with pspa alone. in contrast to conjugate, but similar to intact bacteria, the primary pps14-specific igg response to beads coated simultaneously with pps14+[pspa] peaked rapidly, with the secondary response highly enriched for the 44.1-idiotype and lacking affinity maturation. these results demonstrate that noncovalent association in a particle, of polysaccharide and protein, recapitulates essential immunologic characteristics of intact bacteria that are distinct from soluble covalent conjugates of these respective ags.

TI  == streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis: multiple faces of the same disease.
AB  == the role of streptococcus species as an aetiological microorganism of vertebral osteomyelitis (vo) is considered to be of little relevance. we aimed to describe  a large number of cases of streptococcal vertebral osteomyelitis (svo), to analyze the clinical features associated with different streptococcus species, and to compare them with a cohort of patients with vo caused by staphylococcus aureus. an incidence study and a retrospective, multicenter, observational clinical study of cases of svo (1991-2011) were performed. statistical comparison of svo by different species and between them and staphylococcal vo was carried out. over the whole period there was an increasing incidence in the number of vos and svos per year (p <0.05). among 58 cases of svo, those caused by non-viridans  streptococcus (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes; n = 26) mimicked vo by s. aureus, and presented with more fever, neurological symptoms and paravertebral abscesses in comparison with those caused by the viridans group (remaining species). in contrast, the latter have a  sub-acute clinical picture and were associated with the presence of endocarditis  (p <0.05). among non-viridans svos, concomitant infection was specifically related to s. pneumoniae (p <0.05). in conclusion, svo presents a wide range of clinical patterns. the relationship between vo and diagnosis of endocarditis was  established with svo caused by the viridans group. whereas non-viridans svo mimics acute characteristics of vo caused by s. aureus, cases of viridans svo are significantly more likely to have a sub-acute clinical presentation. the increased incidence of svo during the last decades could support a new epidemiological scenario.

TI  == immunosuppressive property within the streptococcus pneumoniae cell wall that inhibits generation of t follicular helper, germinal center, and plasma cell response to a coimmunized heterologous protein.
AB  == we previously demonstrated that intact, inactivated streptococcus pneumoniae (unencapsulated strain r36a) inhibits igg responses to a number of coimmunized soluble antigens (ags). in this study, we investigated the mechanism of this inhibition and whether other extracellular bacteria exhibited similar effects. no inhibition was observed if r36a was given 24 h before or after immunization with  soluble chicken ovalbumin (cova), indicating that r36a acts transiently during the initiation of the immune response. using transgenic cova-specific cd4(+) t cells, we observed that r36a had no significant effect on t-cell activation (24 h) or generation of regulatory t cells (day 7) and only a modest effect on t-cell proliferation (48 to 96 h) in response to cova. however, r36a mediated a significant reduction in the formation of ag-specific splenic germinal center t follicular helper (gc tfh) and gc b cells and antibody-secreting cells in the spleen and bone marrow in response to cova or cova conjugated to 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl hapten (np-cova). of note, the inhibitory effect of intact r36a on the igg anti-cova response could be reproduced using r36a-derived  cell walls. in contrast to r36a, neither inactivated, unencapsulated, intact neisseria meningitidis nor streptococcus agalactiae inhibited the ova-specific igg response. these results suggest a novel immunosuppressive property within the cell wall of streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == comparison of the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens by applying time-series analysis in results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination.
AB  == the objective of this study is to examine and compare the trends of mastitis pathogens in quarter milk samples (n = 240,232) submitted for microbiological examination at the milk analysis laboratory (l.i.g.a.l.) at galicia, spain from june 2005 to september 2011. autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models and multivariate statistical techniques such as cluster analysis were used in order to detect seasonal trends and similarities between the series trends and to classify mastitis pathogens into relatively homogeneous groups. the decrease of bulk milk somatic cell counts achieved by the mastitis control program, developed in recent years in this region, is the result of the decrease in imi caused by a limited number of mastitis pathogens. the obtained results reflect a  greater complexity in the behavior of mastitis pathogens, unlike the traditional  classification into contagious or environmental. staphylococcus aureus showed a trend similar to streptococcus dysgalactiae, a mastitis pathogen can behave in both a contagious and an environmental manner. among the traditionally considered environmental mastitis pathogens, strep. uberis showed a different behavior to escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) species and streptococcus other than strep. agalactiae showed differences in the trend model. time-series analysis and multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, could be powerful tools to assess the isolation trend of mastitis pathogens because of their ability to cope with stochastic dependence of consecutive data. furthermore, they could be used to identify the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens using the results of milk samples  submitted for routine microbiological examination, by classifying them into relatively homogeneous groups.

AB  == background & objectives: haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) is one of the leading bacterial causes of invasive disease in populations without access to hib conjugate vaccines (hib-cv). india has recently decided to introduce hib-cv into  the routine immunization programme in selected states. longitudinal data quantifying the burden of bacterial meningitis and the proportion of disease caused by various bacteria are needed to track the impact of hib-cv once introduced. a hospital-based sentinel surveillance network was established at four places in the country and this study reports the results of this ongoing surveillance. methods: children aged 1 to 23 months with suspected bacterial meningitis were enrolled in chennai, lucknow, new delhi, and vellore between july 2008 and june 2010. all cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples were tested using cytological, biochemical, and culture methods. samples with abnormal csf (>/=10 wbc per mul) were tested by latex agglutination test for common paediatric bacterial meningitis pathogens. results: a total of 708 patients with abnormal csf were identified, 89 of whom had a bacterial pathogen confirmed. hib accounted for the majority of bacteriologically confirmed cases, 62 (70%), while streptococcus pneumoniae and group b streptococcus were identified in 12 (13%) and seven (8%) cases, respectively. the other eight cases were a mix of other bacteria. the proportion of abnormal csf and probable bacterial meningitis that was caused by hib was 74 and 58 per cent lower at christian medical college (cmc), vellore, which had a 41 per cent coverage of hib-cv among all suspected meningitis cases, compared to the combined average proportion at the other three  centres where a coverage between 1 and 8 per cent was seen (p<0.001 and p= 0.05,  respectively). interpretation & conclusions: hib was found to be the predominant  cause of bacterial meningitis in young children in diverse geographic locations in india. possible indications of herd immunity was seen at cmc compared to sites with low immunization coverage with hib-cv. as hib is the most common pathogen in bacterial meningitis, hib-cv would have a large impact on bacterial meningitis in indian children.

TI  == endocarditis in adults with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == background: endocarditis may precede or complicate bacterial meningitis, but the  incidence and impact of endocarditis in bacterial meningitis are unknown. methods and results: we assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with meningitis and endocarditis from a nationwide cohort study of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the netherlands from 2006 to 2012. endocarditis was identified in 24 of 1025 episodes (2%) of bacterial meningitis.  cultures yielded streptococcus pneumoniae in 13 patients, staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus salivarius in 1 patient each. clues leading to the diagnosis of endocarditis were cardiac murmurs, persistent or recurrent fever, a history of heart valve disease, and s aureus as the causative pathogen of bacterial meningitis. treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy in all patients and surgical valve replacement in 10 patients (42%). two patients were treated with oral anticoagulants, and both developed life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage. systemic (70%) and neurological (54%) complications occurred frequently, leading to a high proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome (63%). seven of 24 patients (29%) with meningitis and endocarditis died. conclusions: endocarditis is an uncommon coexisting condition in bacterial meningitis but is associated with a high rate of unfavorable outcome.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == contemporary potencies of minocycline and tetracycline hcl tested against gram-positive pathogens: sentry program results using clsi and eucast breakpoint  criteria.
AB  == tetracycline class agents vary widely in their activity against emerging important antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter spp. also, published susceptibility breakpoints are discordant between the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi), the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast), and regulatory-approved documents. we have assessed the impact of these differences for tetracycline hcl and minocycline when tested against contemporary gram-positive pathogens. the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2011) compared minocycline and tetracycline hcl activity via reference methods (m07-a9) using a worldwide collection of s. aureus (sa; 4917 strains with 1955 mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae (spn; 1899), s. pyogenes (gra; 246), and s. agalactiae (grb; 217). regardless of applied categorical breakpoints, minocycline exhibited wider coverage (% susceptible) than tetracycline hcl of 4.5-11.8/0.5-2.6/1.4-2.3/0.4-0.4% for mrsa/spn/grb/gra,  respectively. lower eucast susceptible breakpoints produced reduced susceptibility rates for minocycline ranging from no difference (</=0.5 mug/ml) for gra to -8.9% (</=1 mug/ml) for mrsa (97.2% susceptible by clsi; 88.3% by eucast). use of tetracycline hcl-susceptible results to predict minocycline susceptibility was very accurate (99.0-100.0%), with absolute categorical agreement rates ranging from 92.1% to 98.4% (clsi) to 98.4% to 99.6% (eucast) for streptococci; greatest predictive error was noted using the clsi breakpoints (14.7%) compared to eucast criteria (only 5.0%; acceptable), both for mrsa testing dominated by false-resistant results for minocycline. in conclusion, minocycline demonstrates continued superior in vitro activity compared to tetracycline hcl when testing sa (especially mrsa) and pathogenic streptococci. when testing tetracyclines, laboratories must recognize the expanded spectrum of  minocycline against certain pathogens and utilize methods minimizing interpretive error. we conclude that eucast breakpoint criteria (</=0.5 or </=1 mug/ml) represent the most conservative (better recognize strains with tet resistance mechanisms) and accurate tetracycline breakpoint guidelines for testing contemporary isolates of gram-positive cocci.

TI  == inducible clindamycin resistance in beta-hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: resistance to macrolides in beta-hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae arises primarily due to erm(b) or mef(a). erm(b) typically confers high level resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b (mlsb phenotype), whereas mef(a) confers low level resistance to  macrolides only (m phenotype). objectives: to investigate the incidence of macrolide resistance mechanisms in isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci in israel, with particular emphasis on inducible mlsb phenotype. methods: we collected 316 clinical isolates of streptococci during may-august 2010. erythromycin resistance mechanism was determined by the erythromycin-clindamycin double disk diffusion method. results: erythromycin and  clindamycin resistance rates were 19.4% and 13.4% for s. pneumoniae, 4.7% and 1.6% for group a streptococcus (gas), 17% and 17% for group b streptococcus (gbs), and 38.8% and 27.8% for group g streptococcus (ggs) respectively. the most common resistance mechanism for all streptococci was constitutive mlsb (cmlsb). inducible mlss (imlsb) mechanism was found in 3% of all strains and represented 25% of resistance mechanisms. conclusions: the prevalence of macrolide resistance and the distribution of resistance mechanisms differ among beta-hemolytic streptococci and s. pneumoniae, with gbs, ggs and s. pneumoniae showing the highest resistance rate. macrolide or lincosamide cannot be empirically used for  severe streptococcal infections before strains are proved to be susceptible. continuous surveillance of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance patterns among streptococci is needed.

TI  == no change in antibiotic susceptibility patterns in the neonatal icu over two decades.
AB  == objectives: to identify trends in early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis neonatal rates and to evaluate the appropriateness of the empirical antibiotic protocols. design: a 17-yr (1993-2009) analysis of positive blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. setting: the two neonatal icus at the hadassah- hebrew university medical center. results: during this period, 991 infants had at least one episode of either bacteremia or meningitis. the overall incidence of early-onset sepsis was 0.64 per 1,000 live births with a nonsignificant trend over the study period (p = 0.37). the overall incidence of late-onset sepsis was  7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the incidence rates (p = 0.021). the incidence of late-onset sepsis was 7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the prevalence rates (p = 0.021). the prevalence of early-onset group b streptococcus bacteremia decreased significantly throughout the study period. among late-onset sepsis, gram-positive and fungi infection rates were stable over time, while gram-negative infection rates showed a significant positive trend (p = 0.007). no significant change in the susceptibility rate of the isolated gram-negative bacteria in late-onset sepsis for the common antibacterial drugs was found. about 85% and 90% of the isolated organisms were susceptible to our early-onset sepsis (ampicillin and gentamicin)  and late-onset sepsis (vancomycin and cefotaxime) protocols, respectively, and these rates were stable over the study period (p = .1 and .55, respectively). sepsis-related mortality was higher among gram- negative sepsis cases resistant to our empiric antibiotic protocol. conclusions: our empiric antibiotic protocols are appropriate despite their continuous use over the last 17 yrs. this may have  been achieved by the use of a controlled antibiotic program and infection control efforts.

TI  == common regulators of virulence in streptococci.
AB  == streptococcal species are a diverse group of bacteria which can be found in animals and humans. their interactions with host organisms can vary from commensal to pathogenic. many of the pathogenic species are causative agents of severe, invasive infections in their hosts, accounting for a high burden of morbidity and mortality, associated with high economic costs in industry and health care. among them, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus suis are discussed here. an environmentally stimulated and tightly controlled expression of their virulence factors is of utmost importance for their pathogenic potential. thus, the most universal and widespread regulators from the classes of stand-alone transcriptional regulators, two-component signal transduction systems (tcs), eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases, and small noncoding rnas are the topic  of this chapter. the regulatory levels are reviewed with respect to function, activity, and their role in pathogenesis. understanding of and interfering with transcriptional regulation mechanisms and networks is a promising basis for the development of novel anti-infective therapies.

TI  == [childhood bacterial meningitis trends in japan from 2009 to 2010].
AB  == we conducted a pediatric survey of bacterial meningitis epidemiology from january 2009 to december 2010 in japan, and obtained the following results for 314 cases  (186 boys, 124 girls, and 4 with gender not reported). children younger than one  year old accounted for the majority of cases (51.2%, 161/314), and the incidence  decreased with increasing age. haemophilus influenzae (in children aged 1 month to 5 years old) was the most common cause of infection (53.2%), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (1 month to 12 years, 24.2%), streptococcus agalactiae (0-4 months, 7.6%), and escherichia coli (0-3 months, 3.2%). susceptibility tests showed that 50.1% (78/153) of the h. influenzae isolates and 63.0% (46/73) of the s. pneumoniae isolates were drug-resistant. combinations of ampicillin and cephem or carbapenem and other beta-lactams were mainly used as the initial antibiotics  for patients under 4 months of age (77.8%, 42/54), and a carbapenem and other beta-lactam combination was used for patients aged 4 months and older (76.4%, 198/259). the final antibiotics for h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae were mainly cefotaxime (ctx) or ceftriaxone (ctrx) and carbapenem, respectively. the overall  fatality rate was 2.0% (6/305). since the haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (hib vaccine) and the 7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv7) are not widely used in japan, only 5 patients in our cohort (all with meningitis not caused by h. influenzae) had been immunized with the hib vaccine, and none had been immunized with the pcv7 vaccine. no remarkable changes in the characteristics of pediatric meningitis have been observed for several years in japan.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == interim susceptibility testing for ceftaroline, a new mrsa-active cephalosporin:  selecting potent surrogate beta-lactam markers to predict ceftaroline activity against clinically indicated species.
AB  == ceftaroline, the bio-active form of parenterally administered ceftaroline fosamil, is a unique broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and was approved for clinical use by the united states food and drug administration in october 2010. in over a year since ceftaroline fosamil approval, no widely used commercial susceptibility test system has added this new compound to its product, therefore  requiring use of alternative agar diffusion methods for clinical microbiology laboratories that want to test clinical isolates for ceftaroline susceptibility.  an alternative strategy of applying a surrogate beta-lactam class marker agent was assessed here, using results from 14,902 organisms (2008-2010) sampled in the usa. very high and acceptable accuracy (>/= 99.75%) was observed for predicting ceftaroline susceptibility as follows: 1) use of imipenem or meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) at </= 8 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing s. aureus; 2) use of ceftriaxone mic at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible and intermediate categories) when testing streptococcus pneumoniae as well as other streptococci (s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae); and 3) use of ceftriaxone, or cefepime, or ceftazidime at </= 2 mug/ml (susceptible category) when testing haemophilus influenzae. only when testing indicated enterobacteriaceae species using ceftriaxone susceptibility results did the ceftaroline-nonsusceptible errors increase (4.11%). these presented analyses offer a validated surrogate marker strategy for ceftaroline susceptibility testing, pending development and validation by the commonly used automated systems and agar diffusion commercial methods.

TI  == development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (bm). however, no lamp assay is reported to detect streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of bm. moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube lamp assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of the bacteria. the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rrna genes of main pathogens involved in bm were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific lamp assay primers. we successfully designed a set of broad range specific lamp assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. suis and s. agalactiae. the broad range lamp assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli. the sensitivity of our lamp assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional pcr assay. the bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the lamp products with restriction endonuclease ddei and haeiii.

TI  == developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology.
AB  == vaccines have a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology in the era of genomics is taking advantage of new technologies to tackle diseases for which  vaccine development has so far been unsuccessful. almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. however, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. as such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'reverse vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen  to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to  the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery,  including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate  in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. the process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup b neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. as novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach.

AB  == background: hiv-exposed newborns may be at higher risk of sepsis because of immune system aberrations, impaired maternal antibody transfer and altered exposure to pathogenic bacteria. methods: we performed a secondary analysis of a  study (clinicaltrials.gov, number nct00136370) conducted between april 2004 and october 2007 in south africa. we used propensity score matching to evaluate the association between maternal hiv infection and (1) vaginal colonization with bacterial pathogens; (2) vertical transmission of pathogens to the newborn; and (3) sepsis within 3 days of birth (eos) or between 4-28 days of life (los). results: colonization with group b streptococcus (17% vs 23%, p = .0002), escherichia coli (47% vs 45%, p = .374), and klebsiella pneumoniae (7% vs 10%, p  = .008) differed modestly between hiv-infected and uninfected women, as did vertical transmission rates. maternal hiv infection was not associated with increased risk of neonatal eos or los, although culture-confirmed eos was >3 times higher among hiv-exposed infants (p = .05). when compared with hiv-unexposed, neonates, hiv-exposed, uninfected neonates (heu) had a lower risk  of eos (20.6 vs 33.7 per 1000 births; p = .046) and similar rate of los (5.8 vs 4.1; p = .563). hiv-infected newborns had a higher risk than heu of eos (134 vs 21.5; p < .0001) and los (26.8 vs 5.6; p = .042). conclusions: maternal hiv infection was not associated with increased risk of maternal bacterial colonization, vertical transmission, eos, or los. hiv-infected neonates, however, were at increased risk of eos and los.

TI  == identification of the actin and plasminogen binding regions of group b streptococcal phosphoglycerate kinase.
AB  == phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk), present on the surface of group b streptococcus (gbs), has previously been demonstrated to bind the host proteins actin and plasminogen. the actin and plasminogen binding sites of gbs-pgk were identified using truncated gbs-pgk molecules, followed by peptide mapping. these experiments identified two actin and plasminogen binding sites located between amino acids 126-134 and 204-208 of the 398-amino acid-long gbs-pgk molecule. substitution of  the lysine residues within these regions with alanine resulted in significantly reduced binding to both actin and plasminogen. in addition, conversion of the glutamic acid residue at amino acid 133 to proline, the amino acid found at this  position for the pgk protein of streptococcus pneumoniae, also resulted in significantly reduced binding to actin and plasminogen. these results demonstrate that the lysine residues at amino acid positions 126, 127, 130, 204, and 208 along with the glutamic acid residue at amino acid position 133 are necessary for actin and plasminogen binding by gbs-pgk.

TI  == chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  == background: in 1957, tunisia introduced 117 species of eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. actually, eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. a few investigations were reported on the biological activities of eucalyptus oils worldwide. in tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. at that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against  clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. methods:  the essential oils of eight eucalyptus species harvested from the jbel abderrahman, korbous (north east tunisia) and souinet arboreta (north of tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. results: twenty five components were identified by gc/fid  and gc/ms. these components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. the chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. according to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % i, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to eucalyptus oils. the cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within eucalyptus species  oils. conclusions: e. odorata showed the strongest activity against s. aureus, h. influenzae, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and against all the tested  fungal strains. in addition, e. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. however, the best antiviral activity appeared with e. bicostata. virus pretreatment with e. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (ic(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, si = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (ic(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, si =  3.33). the essential oil of e. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. this activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  == characterization of a streptococcus suis tet(o/w/32/o)-carrying element transferable to major streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == mosaic tetracycline resistance determinants are a recently discovered class of hybrids of ribosomal protection tet genes. they may show different patterns of mosaicism, but their final size has remained unaltered. initially thought to be confined to a small group of anaerobic bacteria, mosaic tet genes were then found to be widespread. in the genus streptococcus, a mosaic tet gene [tet(o/w/32/o)] was first discovered in streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant pig and human pathogen. in this study, we report the molecular characterization of a tet(o/w/32/o) gene-carrying mobile element from an s. suis isolate. tet(o/w/32/o) was detected, in tandem with tet(40), in a circular 14,741-bp genetic element (39.1% g+c; 17 open reading frames [orfs] identified). the novel element, which we designated 15k, also carried the macrolide resistance determinant erm(b) and an aminoglycoside resistance four-gene cluster including aade (streptomycin) and  apha (kanamycin). 15k appeared to be an unstable genetic element that, in the absence of recombinases, is capable of undergoing spontaneous excision under standard growth conditions. in the integrated form, 15k was found inside a 54,879-bp integrative and conjugative element (ice) (50.5% g+c; 55 orfs), which we designated icessu32457. an approximately 1.3-kb segment that apparently served as the att site for excision of the unstable 15k element was identified. the novel ice was transferable at high frequency to recipients from pathogenic streptococcus species (s. suis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae), suggesting that the multiresistance 15k element can successfully spread within streptococcal populations.

TI  == gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. escherichia coli is the most common uti pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. in this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. a total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. overall escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). data stratification  according to both age and gender showed e. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom p. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was  shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). susceptibility of e. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as  follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). in conclusion,  both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining utis etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.

TI  == sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  == we investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it  is now a clinical problem in japan. six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). major causative bacteria detected were escherichia coli (65.0 %), enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). from 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were e. coli (61.5 %), e. faecalis (13.7 %), k. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and s. agalactiae (4.0 %). the sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (fqs) and cephems of e. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. in regard to infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [lvfx] >/=4 mug/ml), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of fq administration within 1 month. although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to fqs of e. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. the major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant e. coli were a history of fq administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. it was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of fq administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.

TI  == relationship between lactobacilli and opportunistic bacterial pathogens associated with vaginitis.
AB  == background: vaginitis, is an infectious inflammation of the vaginal mucosa, which sometimes involves the vulva. the balance of the vaginal flora is maintained by the lactobacilli and its protective and probiotic role in treating and preventing vaginal infection by producing antagonizing compounds which are regarded as safe  for humans. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the protective role of lactobacilli against common bacterial opportunistic pathogens in vaginitis and study the effects of some antibiotics on lactobacilli isolates. materials and methods: in this study (110) vaginal swabs were obtained from women suffering from vaginitis who admitted to babylon hospital of maternity and paediatrics in babylon province, iraq. the study involved the role of intrauterine device among  married women with vaginitis and also involved isolation of opportunistic bacterial isolates among pregnant and non pregnant women. this study also involved studying probiotic role of lactobacilli by production of some defense factors like hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocin, and lactic acid. results: results revealed that a total of 130 bacterial isolates were obtained. intrauterine device was a predisposing factor for vaginitis. the most common opportunistic bacterial isolates were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, and klebsiella pneumoniae. all lactobacilli were hydrogen peroxide producers while some isolates were bacteriocin producers that inhibited some of opportunistic pathogens (s. aureus, e. coli). lactobacilli were sensitive to erythromycin while 93.3% of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin and (40%, 53.3%) of them were resistant to amoxicillin and gentamycin respectively. results revealed that there was an inverse relationship between lactobacilli presence and organisms causing vaginitis. this may be attributed to the production of defense  factors by lactobacilli. conclusion: the types of antibiotics used to treat vaginitis must be very selective in order not to kill the beneficial bacteria (lactobacilli) that help in preservation of vaginal health and ecosystem as being one of the probiotic bacteria.

TI  == structurally identical capsular polysaccharide expressed by intact group b streptococcus versus streptococcus pneumoniae elicits distinct murine polysaccharide-specific igg responses in vivo.
AB  == we previously reported distinct differences in the murine in vivo ig polysaccharide (ps)-specific responses to intact streptococcus pneumoniae compared with responses to neisseria meningitidis and that in each case, the bacterial subcapsular domain markedly influences the ig response to the associated ps. in light of potentially unique contributions of biochemically distinct capsular ps and/or their characteristic attachments to the underlying bacterium, it remains unresolved whether different bacterial subcapsular domains  can exert differential effects on ps-specific ig responses to distinct bacterial  pathogens. in this report, we used a mutant strain of group b streptococcus (streptococcus agalactiae) type iii (gbs-iii) that expresses desialylated capsular polysaccharide of gbs-iii, biochemically identical to capsular pneumococcal polysaccharide type 14 (pps14) of streptococcus pneumoniae (intact inactivated streptococcus pneumoniae, capsular type 14, pn14), directly to compare the in vivo pps14-specific igg responses to two distinct gram-positive bacteria. although both gbs-iii and pn14 elicited relatively rapid primary pps14-specific igg responses dependent on cd4(+) t cells, b7-dependent costimulation, and cd40-cd40l interactions, only gbs-iii induced a highly boosted icos-dependent pps14-specific igg response after secondary immunization. of note, priming with pn14 and boosting with gbs-iii, although not isolated pps14, elicited a similar boosted pps14-specific igg response that was dependent on cd4(+) t cells during secondary immunization, indicating that pn14 primes for memory but, unlike gbs-iii, fails to elicit it. the inability of pn14 to elicit a boosted pps14-specific igg response was overcome by coimmunization with unencapsulated gbs-iii. collectively, these data establish that structurally identical capsular ps expressed by two distinct gram-positive extracellular bacteria can indeed elicit distinct ps-specific igg responses in vivo.

TI  == a multi-target real-time pcr assay for rapid identification of meningitis-associated microorganisms.
AB  == a central nervous system (cns) infection, such as meningitis, is a serious and life-threatening condition. bacterial meningitis can be severe and may result in  brain damage, disability or even death. rapid diagnosis of cns infections and identification of the pathogenic microorganisms are needed to improve the patient outcome. bacterial culture of a patient's cerebrospinal fluid (csf) is currently  considered the "gold standard" for diagnosing bacterial meningitis. from the csf  cultures researchers can assess the in vitro susceptibility of the causative microorganism to determine the best antibiotic treatment. however, many of the culture assays, such as microscopy and the latex agglutination test are not sensitive. to enhance pathogen detection in csf samples we developed a multi-target real-time pcr assay that can rapidly identify six different microorganisms: streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and cryptococcus neoformans. in this study we applied this pcr analysis to 296 csf samples from patients who were suspected of having meningitis. of the 296 samples that were examined, 59 samples were positive according to the csf culture and/or molecular  assays. forty-six csf samples were positive for both the csf culture and our real-time pcr assay, while 13 samples were positive for the real-time pcr but negative for the traditional assays. this discrepancy may have been caused by the fact that these samples were collected from 23 patients who were treated with antimicrobials before csf sampling.

TI  == subtractive genomics approach to identify putative drug targets and identification of drug-like molecules for beta subunit of dna polymerase iii in streptococcus species.
AB  == the prolonged use of the antibiotics over the years has transformed many organisms resistant to multiple drugs. this has made the field of drug discovery  of vital importance in curing various infections and diseases. the drugs act by binding to a specific target protein of prime importance for the cell's survival. streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes are the few gram positive organisms that have developed resistance to drugs. it causes pneumonia, meningitis, pharyngitis, otitis media, sinusitis, bacteremia, pericarditis, and arthritis infections. the present study was carried out to identify potential drug targets and inhibitors for beta subunit of dna polymerase iii in these three streptococcus species that might facilitate the discovery of novel drugs in near future. various steps were adopted to find out novel drug targets. and finally 3d structure of dna polymerase iii subunit beta was modeled. the ligand library was generated from various databases to find the most suitable ligands. all the ligands were docked using molegro virtual docker and the lead molecules were investigated for adme and toxicity.

TI  == identification of conserved antigens from staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens.
AB  == the design of vaccines containing epitopes shared between different human pathogens may lead to cross-species protection. in order to identify potentially  conserved bacterial antigens, bacteriophage expression libraries of genomic dna from streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were probed with human sera from staphylococcus aureus-infected and healthy individuals. by comparison with previous screening data from staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. aureus, putative antigenic, conserved domains across the genera were identified. in particular, three potentially antigenic conserved regions were identified based on the n-terminal domain of sacol0609 (sdrd), the c-terminal domain of sacol0723 (scab) and the c-terminus of sacol1140 (isda) from staph. aureus. the three domains were overexpressed, recombinant proteins were purified and polyclonal antisera raised against them recognized cell surface-located proteins from both staphylococcal and streptococcal species. the antisera were also able to opsonize both staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae thereby increasing their phagocytic uptake by human neutrophils. the conserved antigenic domains therefore represent potential cross-protective vaccine candidates.

TI  == mechanisms underlying in vivo polysaccharide-specific immunoglobulin responses to intact extracellular bacteria.
AB  == polysaccharides (ps) have historically been viewed as t cell-independent antigens. however, in this paper i propose a new concept, based on substantial data from my laboratory over the previous 10 years, that during infections with ps-encapsulated extracellular bacteria, ps-specific igg responses are largely cd4(+) t cell dependent. thus, capsular ps is typically encountered by the immune system covalently attached to the underlying subcapsular bacterial domain. i speculate that noncovalent association of ps with immunogenic proteins within the bacterial particle leads to recruitment of protein-specific cd4(+) t cell help for the anti-ps response. however, differences in the composition and/or structure of the subcapsular domain of different extracellular bacteria may result in distinct anti-ps responses as well as differential effects on the immune response to coimmunizing soluble antigens. cd4(+) t cell help for igg anti-ps responses during infections with extracellular bacteria is likely to promote opsonic clearance of these rapidly growing pathogens. however, the expression of immunosuppressive components by certain bacteria may also serve to  dampen such responses.

TI  == streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant animal and human pathogen.
AB  == streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, has been receiving growing attention not only for its role in severe and increasingly reported infections in humans, but also for its involvement in drug resistance. recent studies and the analysis of sequenced genomes have been providing important insights into the s.  suis resistome, and have resulted in the identification of resistance determinants for tetracyclines, macrolides, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, antifolate drugs, streptothricin, and cadmium salts. resistance gene-carrying genetic elements described so far include integrative and conjugative elements, transposons, genomic islands, phages, and chimeric elements. some of these elements are similar to those reported in major streptococcal pathogens such as streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae and share the same chromosomal insertion sites. the available information strongly suggests that s. suis is an important antibiotic resistance reservoir that can contribute to the spread of resistance genes to the above-mentioned streptococci. s. suis is thus a paradigmatic example of possible intersections between animal and human resistomes.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of mastitis pathogens of dairy cattle and comparative relevance to humans.
AB  == mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, can be caused by a wide range of organisms, including gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas and algae. many microbial species that are common causes of bovine mastitis, such as  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus also occur as commensals or pathogens of humans whereas other causative species, such as streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae or staphylococcus chromogenes, are almost exclusively found in animals. a wide range of molecular typing methods have been used in the past two decades to investigate the epidemiology of bovine mastitis at the subspecies  level. these include comparative typing methods that are based on electrophoretic banding patterns, library typing methods that are based on the sequence of selected genes, virulence gene arrays and whole genome sequencing projects. the strain distribution of mastitis pathogens has been investigated within individual animals and across animals, herds, countries and host species, with consideration of the mammary gland, other animal or human body sites, and environmental sources. molecular epidemiological studies have contributed considerably to our understanding of sources, transmission routes, and prognosis for many bovine mastitis pathogens and to our understanding of mechanisms of host-adaptation and  disease causation. in this review, we summarize knowledge gleaned from two decades of molecular epidemiological studies of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle and discuss aspects of comparative relevance to human medicine.

AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == structural differences between the streptococcus agalactiae housekeeping and pilus-specific sortases: srta and srtc1.
AB  == the assembly of pili on the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria requires transpeptidase enzymes called sortases. in streptococcus agalactiae, the pi-1 pilus island of strain 2603v/r encodes two pilus-specific sortases (srtc1 and srtc2) and three pilins (gbs80, gbs52 and gbs104). although either pilus-specific sortase is sufficient for the polymerization of the major pilin, gbs80, incorporation of the minor pilins gbs52 and gbs104 into the pilus structure requires srtc1 and srtc2, respectively. the s. agalactiae housekeeping sortase, srta, whose gene is present at a different location and does not catalyze pilus polymerization, was shown to be involved in cell wall anchoring of pilus polymers. to understand the structural basis of sortases involved in such diverse functions, we determined the crystal structures of s. agalactiae srtc1 and srta.  both enzymes are made of an eight-stranded beta-barrel core with variations in their active site architecture. srta exhibits a catalytic triad arrangement similar to that in streptococcus pyogenes srta but different from that in staphylococcus aureus srta. in contrast, the srtc1 enzyme contains an n-terminal  helical domain and a 'lid' in its putative active site, which is similar to that  seen in streptococcus pneumoniae pilus-specific sortases, although with subtle differences in positioning and composition. to understand the effect of such differences on substrate recognition, we have also determined the crystal structure of a srtc1 mutant, in which the conserved dp(w/f/y) motif was replaced  with the sorting signal motif of gbs80, ipntg. by comparing the structures of wt  wild type srta and srtc1 and the 'lid' mutant of srtc1, we propose that structural elements within the active site and the lid may be important for defining the role of specific sortase in pili biogenesis.

TI  == frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria in makkah hospitals.
AB  == background and objective: gram-positive bacteria are important nosocomial pathogens. the objective of this study was to estimate the frequencies and resistance rates of gram-positive pathogens isolated from hospitals in makkah, saudi arabia. design and setting: prospective study at three makkah hospitals from may 2008 to april 2009. patients and methods: clinical isolates were collected and demographic and laboratory data were recorded. standard microbiological methods were used to identify the organisms and test for antimicrobial susceptibility. the results were interpreted according to the clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. results: clinical isolates were collected from 1087 patients. gram-positive pathogens infected all  age groups, but had no gender predominance. staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of wound infection and accounted for more than half of the clinical  isolates (688 cases). coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons) was a common isolate from blood cultures. wounds were the most common site of infection (37.6%). enterococcus spp. and streptococcus agalactiae were the second most common bacteria (26%). the resistance rates of s aureus and cons isolates were 39.4% and 82.4% for oxacillin, respectively. among the streptococci, the resistance rates of streptococcus pneumoniae were 21.1% and 16.7% for ampicillin  and erythromycin, respectively. conclusions: s aureus infections were found to be very common in the makkah hospitals. infection prevention, control measures and continuous monitoring for antibiotic susceptibility are necessary to reduce these and other nosocomial infections.

TI  == multiplex pcr and reverse line blot hybridization assay (mpcr/rlb).
AB  == multiplex pcr/reverse line blot hybridization assay allows the detection of up to 43 molecular targets in 43 samples using one multiplex pcr reaction followed by probe hybridization on a nylon membrane, which is re-usable. probes are 5' amine  modified to allow fixation to the membrane. primers are 5' biotin modified which  allows detection of hybridized pcr products using streptavidin-peroxidase and a chemiluminescent substrate via photosensitive film. with low setup and consumable costs, this technique is inexpensive (approximately us$2 per sample), high throughput (multiple membranes can be processed simultaneously) and has a short turnaround time (approximately 10 hours). the technique can be utilized in a number of ways. multiple probes can be designed to detect sequence variation within a single amplified product, or multiple products can be amplified simultaneously, with one (or more) probes used for subsequent detection. a combination of both approaches can also be used within a single assay. the ability to include multiple probes for a single target sequence makes the assay highly specific. published applications of mpcr/rlb include detection of antibiotic resistance genes(1,2), typing of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus(3-5) and salmonella sp(6), molecular serotyping of streptococcus pneumoniae(7,8), streptococcus agalactiae(9) and enteroviruses(10,11), identification of mycobacterium sp(12), detection of genital(13-15) and respiratory tract(16) and other(17) pathogens and detection and identification of mollicutes(18). however, the versatility of the technique means the applications  are virtually limitless and not restricted to molecular analysis of micro-organisms. the five steps in mpcr/rlb are a) primer and probe design, b) dna extraction and pcr amplification c) preparation of the membrane, d) hybridization and detection, and e) regeneration of the membrane.

TI  == design of benzimidazole- and benzoxazole-2-thione derivatives as inhibitors of bacterial hyaluronan lyase.
AB  == bacterial hyaluronan lyases (hyal) degrade hyaluronan, an important component of  the extracellular matrix, and are involved in microbial spread. hyal inhibitors may serve as tools to study the role of the enzyme, its substrates and products in the course of bacterial infections. moreover, such enzyme inhibitors are potential candidates for antibacterial combination therapy. based on crystal structures of streptococcus pneumoniae hyal in complex with a hexasaccharide substrate and with different inhibitors, 1-acylated benzimidazole-2-thiones and benzoxazole-2-thiones were derived as new leads for the inhibition of streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hyal. structure-based optimization led to n-(3-phenylpropionyl)benzoxazole-2-thione, one of the most potent compounds known to date (ic(50) values: 24 mum at ph 7.4, 15 mum at ph 5). among the 27 new derivatives, other n-acylated benzimidazoles and benzoxazoles are just as active  at ph 7.4, but not at ph 5. the results support a binding mode characterized by interactions with residues in the catalytic site and with a hydrophobic patch.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-saharan africa and asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-saharan africa and asia to the macrolide antibiotics. methods: inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. the data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. results: a total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. in general, there was less macrolide resistance in african than in asian isolates. most african studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. there was very little information available for gram-negative organisms. conclusions: susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in ssa remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against salmonellae spp.  in asia. in urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. however, there is no information  on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == incidence and severity of invasive streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, and group b streptococcus infections among pregnant and postpartum women.
AB  == background: the epidemiology of streptococcal infection in pregnant and postpartum women is poorly described in recent literature. we used data from multistate surveillance for invasive streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus (gas), and group b streptococcus (gbs) infections to estimate disease incidence and severity in these populations. methods: cases were reported through the centers for disease control and prevention active bacterial core surveillance, an active population- and laboratory-based system. a case was defined as illness in a woman aged 15-44 years with streptococcus isolated from a normally sterile body site during 2007-2009. pregnant or postpartum status was recorded at the time of culture. incidence was calculated as cases per 1000 woman-years with use of national census data; 95% confidence intervals were calculated on the basis of lambda distribution. we used multivariable logistic regression to explore associations between pregnant or postpartum status and hospital length of stay, a marker of disease severity. results: we identified 1848 cases in women; 6.0% of women were pregnant, and 7.5% were postpartum. pregnant women had a higher mean incidence of gbs disease, compared with nonpregnant women (0.04 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.03-0.05 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.02 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.02-0.02 cases per  1000 woman-years]). postpartum women had elevated mean incidence of all 3 pathogens, compared with nonpregnant women (s. pneumoniae: 0.15 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.09-0.25 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.052 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.049-0.056 cases per 1000 woman-years]; gas: 0.56 cases per  1000 woman-years [range, 0.42-0.70 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.019 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.017-0.021 cases per 1000 woman-years]; gbs: 0.49 cases per 1000 woman-years [range, 0.36-0.64 cases per 1000 woman-years] vs 0.018 [range, 0.016-0.020 cases per 1000 woman-years]). neither pregnancy nor postpartum status was associated with longer length of stay among women infected  with any of the 3 pathogens. conclusions: although invasive streptococcal infections do not appear to be more severe in pregnant or postpartum women, postpartum women have a 20-fold increased incidence of gas and gbs, compared with nonpregnant women.

TI  == assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  == despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. one key component of better control of this  disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. this study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial dna extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples  to complement traditional microbiological identification. extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. the following species were identified: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and klebsiella spp. (including klebsiella oxytoca and klebsiella pneumoniae). the detection procedure includes specific genomic dna amplification  by multiplex pcr for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. the specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. the extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. the analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/ml for milk samples spiked with staph. aureus, strep. dysgalactiae, and e. coli, with a tendency for  k. pneumoniae. the detection limit was 500 cfu/ml for strep. uberis and strep. agalactiae. the overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. when the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, dna purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16s sequencing. the  proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated pcr detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.

TI  == absence of pneumococcal pcsb is associated with overexpression of lysm domain-containing proteins.
AB  == the streptococcal protein required for cell separation b (pcsb) is predicted to play an important role in peptidoglycan metabolism, based on sequence motifs and  altered phenotypes of gene deletion mutant cells exhibiting defects in cell separation. however, no enzymic activity has been demonstrated for pcsb so far. by generating gene deletion mutant strains in four different genetic backgrounds  we could demonstrate that pcsb is not essential for cell survival in streptococcus pneumoniae, but is essential for proper cell division. deletion mutant cells displayed cluster formation due to aberrant cell division, reduced growth and antibiotic sensitivity that were fully reverted by transformation with a plasmid carrying pcsb. immunofluorescence staining revealed that pcsb was localized to the cell poles, similarly to pbp3 and lytb, enzymes with demonstrated peptidoglycan-degrading activity required for daughter cell separation. similarly to other studies with pcsb homologues, we could not detect  peptidoglycan-lytic activity with recombinant or native pneumococcal pcsb in vitro. in addition to defects in septum placement and separation, the absence of  pcsb induced an increased release of several proteins, such as enolase, malx and  the sp0107 lysm domain protein. interestingly, genes encoding both lysm domain-containing proteins that are present in the pneumococcal genome (sp0107 and sp2063) and predicted to be involved in cell wall metabolism were found to be highly overexpressed (14-33-fold increase) in deltapcsb cells in two different genetic backgrounds. otherwise, we detected very few changes in the global gene expression profile of cells lacking pcsb. thus our data suggest that lysm domain  proteins partially compensate for the lack of pcsb function and allow the survival and slow growth of the pneumococcus.

AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == bacterial pore-forming cytolysins induce neuronal damage in a rat model of neonatal meningitis.
AB  == background: group b streptococcus (gbs) and streptococcus pneumoniae (sp) are leading causes of bacterial meningitis in neonates and children. each pathogen produces a pore-forming cytolytic toxin, beta-hemolysin/cytolysin (beta-h/c) by gbs and pneumolysin by sp. the aim of this study was to understand the role of these pore-forming cytotoxins, in particular of the gbs beta-h/c, as potential neurotoxins in experimental neonatal meningitis. methods: meningitis was induced  in 7- and 11-day-old rats by intracisternal injection of wild type (wt) gbs or sp and compared with isogenic beta-h/c- or pneumolysin-deficient mutants, or a double mutant of sp deficient in pneumolysin and hydrogen peroxide production. results: gbs beta-h/c and sp pneumolysin contributed to neuronal damage, worsened clinical outcome and weight loss, but had no influence on the early kinetics of leukocyte influx and bacterial growth in the cerebrospinal fluid. in vitro, beta-h/c-induced neuronal apoptosis occurred independently of caspase-activation  and was not preventable by the broad spectrum caspase-inhibitor z-vad-fmk. conclusions: these data suggest that both cytolytic toxins, the gbs beta-h/c and  sp pneumolysin, contribute to neuronal damage in meningitis and extend the concept of a key role for bacterial pore-forming cytolysins in the pathogenesis and sequelae of neonatal meningitis.

AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == autocatalytic intramolecular isopeptide bond formation in gram-positive bacterial pili: a qm/mm simulation.
AB  == many gram-positive pathogens possess external pili or fimbriae with which they adhere to host cells during the infection process. unusual dual intramolecular isopeptide bonds between asn and lys side chains within the n-terminal and c-terminal domains of the pilus subunits have been observed initially in the streptococcus pyogenes pilin subunit spy0128 and subsequently in gbs52 from streptococcus agalactiae, in the bcpa major pilin of bacillus cereus and in the rrgb pilin of streptococcus pneumoniae, among others. within each pilin subunit,  intramolecular isopeptide bonds serve to stabilize the protein. these bonds provide a means to withstand large external mechanical forces, as well as possibly assisting in supporting a conformation favored for pilin subunit polymerization via sortase transpeptidases. genome-wide analyses of pili-containing gram-positive bacteria are known or suspected to contain isopeptide bonds in pilin subunits. for the autocatalytic formation of isopeptide cross-links, a conservation of three amino acids including asn, lys, and a catalytically important acidic glu (or asp) residue are responsible. however, the chemical mechanism of how isopeptide bonds form within pilin remains poorly understood. although it is possible that several mechanistic paths could lead to  isopeptide bond formation in pili, the requirement of a conserved glutamate and highly organized positioning of residues within the hydrophobic environment of the active site were found in numerous pilin crystal structures such as spy0128 and rrgb. this suggests a mechanism involving direct coupling of lysine side chain amine to the asparagine carboxamide mediated by critical acid/base or hydrogen bonding interactions with the catalytic glutamate residue. from this mechanistic perspective, we used the qm/mm minimum free-energy path method to examine the reaction details of forming the isopeptide bonds with spy0128 as a model pilin, specifically focusing on the role of the glutamate in catalysis. it  was determined that the reaction mechanism likely consists of two major steps: the nucleophilic attack on cgamma by nitrogen in the unprotonated lys epsilon-amino group and, then two concerted proton transfers occur during the formation of the intramolecular isopeptide bond to subsequently release ammonia.  more importantly, within the dual active sites of spy0128, glu(117), and glu(258) residues function as crucial catalysts for each isopeptide bond formation, respectively, by relaying two proton transfers. this work also suggests that domain-domain interactions within spy0128 may modulate the reactivity of residues within each active site. our results may hopefully shed light on the molecular mechanisms of pilin biogenesis in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == genomic organization, structure, regulation and pathogenic role of pilus constituents in major pathogenic streptococci and enterococci.
AB  == oligocomponent pilus structures, recently discovered in many important gram-positive pathogens, represent a new class of virulence factors with adhesive and matrix protein-binding activity. some of these proteins have emerged as very  promising lead components of protein-based vaccines against streptococci. these extended surface structures play key roles in host cell and tissue adherence, paracellular translocation, and biofilm formation of major gram-positive pathogens such as streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae as well as in opportunistic and nosocomial pathogens like enterococci. here, we discuss the  similarities and differences of: (1) the genomic organization of the various regions encoding pilus proteins, (2) the number, type, and assembly of the proteins constituting the pili, (3) their expression and regulation mechanisms, (4) their role in bacterial virulence, and (5) their potential as vaccine candidate antigens.

TI  == novel plasmid-based genetic tools for the study of promoters and terminators in streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == promoter-probe and terminator-probe plasmid vectors make possible to rapidly examine whether particular sequences function as promoter or terminator signals in various genetic backgrounds and under diverse environmental stimuli. at present, such plasmid-based genetic tools are very scarce in the gram-positive pathogenic bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. hence, we developed novel promoter-probe and terminator-probe vectors based on the streptococcus agalactiae pmv158 plasmid, which replicates autonomously in numerous gram-positive bacteria. as reporter gene, a gfp allele encoding a variant of the green fluorescent protein was used. these genetic tools were shown to be suitable to assess the activity of promoters and terminators (both homologous and heterologous) in s. pneumoniae and e. faecalis. in addition, the promoter-probe vector was shown to be a valuable tool for the analysis of regulated promoters in vivo, such as the promoter of the pneumococcal fuculose kinase gene. these new plasmid vectors will be very useful for the experimental verification of predicted promoter and terminator sequences, as well as for the construction of new inducible-expression vectors. given the promiscuity exhibited by the pmv158 replicon, these vectors could be used in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == structure determination of streptococcus suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharide.
AB  == the capsular polysaccharide (cps) of streptococcus suis serotype 2 was isolated,  purified, chemically modified, and characterized. sugar and absolute configuration analyses of the cps gave the following composition: d-gal, 3; d-glc, 1; d-glcnac, 1; d-neu5ac, 1; l-rha, 1. sialic acid was found to be terminal, and the cps was quantitatively desialylated by mild acid hydrolysis. the cps was also submitted to periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction and smith degradation. sugar and methylation analysis, 1h and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry of the native cps or of its specifically modified products allowed to determine the repeating unit sequence:  [4)[neu5ac(alpha2-6)gal(beta1-4)glcnac(beta1-3)]gal(beta1-4)[gal(alpha1-3)]rha(be ta1-4)glc(beta1-]n. the backbone sequence was found to be identical to that of streptococcus agalactiae or group b streptococcus (gbs) type viii and streptococcus pneumoniae type 23f. the s. suis cps shares the sequence neu5ac-gal-glcnac-gal in common with gbs types ia, ib, ii, iii, and iv cpss but differs from them by the presence of rhamnose and the fact that sialic acid is 2,6- rather than 2,3-linked to the following gal. a correlation between the s. suis cps sequence and genes of the serotype 2 cps locus encoding putative enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the repeating unit was tentatively established.

TI  == mechanisms of meningeal invasion by a bacterial extracellular pathogen, the example of neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (csf) barrier physiologically protects the meningeal spaces from bloodborne bacterial pathogens, due to the existence of specialized junctional interendothelial complexes. a few bacterial pathogens are  able to reach the subarachnoidal space and cause bacterial meningitis in humans,  a rare but dreadful disease. surprisingly, most of them are extracellular commensals of the nasopharynx (neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae) or of the digestive tract (escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae). the particular ability of these pathogens to induce meningitis is related to virulence factors that allow them to escape host innate  immunity, to multiply within the serum, and to interact closely with the endothelial front line of defense of the blood-csf barrier. in vitro studies using microvascular brain endothelial cell lines have shown that induced transcytosis may be a common route used by h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, e. coli  and s. agalactiae to reach the csf. n. meningitidis is a strict human pathogen that interacts very tightly with endothelial cells. adhesion of the meningococcus is mediated by type iv pili that induce a localized remodeling of the sub cortical cytoskeleton, leading to the formation of endothelial membrane protrusions that anchor bacterial colonies at the endoluminal face of the endothelial cell membrane, allowing a better resistance to blood flow. recent work has shown that n. meningitidis is also able to recruit the polarity complex  par3/par6/apkc that re-routes endothelial cell adhesion molecules of interendothelial junctions, opening a paracellular route for bacteria to cross the endothelial barrier.

AB  == oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664),  enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), enterococcus faecium (n = 819), streptococcus  pyogenes (n = 959), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group c, g, and f streptococci (n = 84), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among s. pneumoniae isolates. among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. the maximum oritavancin mic against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the mic(90) against s. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. against e. faecalis and e. faecium, oritavancin mic(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including vana strains (n = 486), with mic(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against vana e. faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); mic(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. these data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. the data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms: tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. against gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline mic(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/l for escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for pseudomonas aeruginosa). against gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline mic(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant a. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli  (7.0%) and k. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (45.9%)  and e. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (13.8%). tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult  to treat organisms.

TI  == toll-like receptors in bacterial meningitis.
AB  == bacterial meningitis is still an important infectious disease with a high morbidity and mortality rate. bacterial infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) space causes a powerful inflammatory reaction that is largely responsibly for meningitis-induced tissue damage and adverse outcome of the disease. in a landmark series of experiments in the mid-1980s, cell wall components including lipooligosaccharides and lipoteichoic acid were indicated to be the key bacterial elements that can trigger the host inflammatory response in the csf. ten years ago, the discovery of toll-like receptor proteins (tlrs) that allow the detection of microbial components and initiate the host immune response opened up new horizons in research on the pathophysiology of meningitis. cell culture approaches provided the first evidence for a crucial role of tlrs in sensing meningeal pathogens including streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus agalactiae, and listeria monocytogenes. subsequently, studies in mice with single or combined deficiencies in tlrs demonstrated that tlr activation is a key event in meningeal inflammation and, even more interestingly, a pivotal factor for meningitis-associated tissue damage. a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions in the csf space may generate new opportunities for specific treatment strategies for bacterial meningitis.

TI  == clinical significance of cerebrospinal fluid inhibitory titers of antibiotics, based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters, in the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  == the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) inhibitory titer (csf-it) of an antibiotic, which can be used to estimate the duration of time above the agent's mic in the csf, was introduced as one of the indices to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic  selection in treating bacterial meningitis. the csf-it was determined via a microdilution method. a suspension of the causative organism was added to a tube  containing twofold diluted csf and double-concentrated mueller-hinton broth with  supplement. the csf-it was determined by the maximum point without turbidity of medium after overnight incubation at 37 degrees c. concerning the strain of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae (blnar), the  killing rates of both meropenem and piperacillin were compared in an in vitro pharmacokinetic (pk) model, in which human pharmacokinetics in csf were simulated. organisms recovered from the csf in 37 treated clinical cases of bacterial meningitis were h. influenzae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus  pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and neisseria meningitidis; in these cases, the csf-it ranged from 1: 8 to as high as 1: 4 096. in the in vitro pk model, the concentrations of both drugs were higher than the mics over a period of 24 h; however, the killing rate of piperacillin was higher than that of meropenem, and  bacterial regrowth was observed after the administration of meropenem. a csf-it value higher than 1: 32 indicates that the antibiotic concentration in the csf exceeds the mic for 24 h. the effect of piperacillin on blnar depends not only on the time above mic of 24 h but also on the maximum concentration in the csf.

TI  == screening of binding activity of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus suis to berries and juices.
AB  == antiadhesion therapy is a promising approach to the fight against pathogens. antibiotic resistance and the lack of effective vaccines have increased the search for new methods to prevent infectious diseases. previous studies have shown the antiadhesion activity of juice from cultivated cranberries (vaccinium macrocarpon ait.) against bacteria, especially e. coli. in this study, the binding of two streptococcal strains, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus  agalactiae, to molecular size fractions (fi, fii and fiii, <10 kda, 10-100 kda, and >100 kda, respectively) of berries and berry and fruit juices from 12 plant species were studied using a microtiter well assay. for streptococcus suis a hemagglutination inhibition assay was used. in general, binding activity was detected especially to wild cranberry (vaccinium oxycoccos l.) and to other vaccinium species. s. pneumoniae cells bound most to cranberry juice fraction fi  and s. agalactiae cells to cranberry fraction fiii. hemagglutination induced by s. suis was most effectively inhibited by cranberry fraction fii. nmr spectra of  some characteristic active and non-active fractions were also measured. they indicate that fractions fii and fiii contained proanthocyanidins and/or other phenolic compounds. the results suggest vaccinium berries as possible sources of  antiadhesives against bacterial infections.

TI  == substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  == unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (ugl) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular  matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal ugls and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. the putative genes for ugl and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. the ugls of these three streptococci were overexpressed in escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. streptococcal ugls degraded unsaturated hyaluronate  and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately ph 5.5 and 37 degrees c. distinct from bacillus sp. gl1 ugl, streptococcal ugls preferred sulfated substrates. dna microarray and western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in s. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. the crystal structure of s. agalactiae ugl (sagugl) was determined at 1.75 a resolution by x-ray crystallography. sagugl adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to bacillus ugl, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. sagugl arg-236 was found to  be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. this is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal ugls.

TI  == rapid detection of eight causative pathogens for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by real-time pcr.
AB  == we aimed to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) collected from patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition to streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae,  and mycoplasma pneumoniae described previously, five other pathogens, neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus,  and listeria monocytogenes, were targeted, based on a large-scale surveillance in japan. results in csf from neonates and children (n=150), and from adults (n=18)  analyzed by real-time pcr with molecular beacon probes were compared with those of conventional culturing. the total time from dna extraction from csf to pcr analysis was 1.5 h. the limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 5 copies to 28 copies per tube. nonspecific positive reactions were not recognized  for 37 microorganisms in clinical isolates as a negative control. the pathogens were detected in 72.0% of the samples by real-time pcr, but in only 48.2% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. with the real-time pcr, the detection rate of h. influenzae from csf was high, at 45.2%, followed by s. pneumoniae (21.4%), s. agalactiae (2.4%), e. coli (1.8%), l. monocytogenes (0.6%), and m. pneumoniae (0.6%). the detection rate with pcr was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration (chi2=18.3182; p=0.0000). in conclusion, detection with real-time  pcr is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.

TI  == [epidemiology of acute bacterial meningitis in adult patients in france].
AB  == in 2006, the number of bacterial meningitis cases was estimated at 1375 (2.23/100,000). the leading pathogens involved in adult meningitis were, according to frequency, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and haemophilus influenzae. the overall mortality rate averaged 20%, higher among patients with pneumococcal meningitis or in individuals over 65 years of age. sequels were observed in 30% of cases and more frequent after pneumococcal meningitis. a decrease in susceptibility to antibiotics was reported for n. meningitidis, s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae. generalized vaccination of children less than two years of age with h. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has lead to a dramatic decrease in adult h. influenza meningitis. the few cases involved almost exclusively non-typeable strains, presenting in 12% of cases, a modified penicillin binding protein leading to a decreased susceptibility to aminopenicillins. decreased susceptibility to amoxicillin was observed in 30% of meningococcal isolates, but  all strains remained susceptible to parenteral third generation cephalosporins. resistances to rifampicin or to ciprofloxacin, recommended in meningococcal meningitis prophylaxis, were unusual, but had to be documented. finally, the proportion of pneumococcal strains with decreased susceptibility to beta-lactams  has decreased since 2002. in adult meningitis, pneumococcal isolates with decreased susceptibility to penicillin, amoxicillin, and cefotaxime or ceftriaxone accounted for 37, 18, and 4% of cases respectively. it should be noted that for these isolates, no parenteral third generation cephalosporins mic  was above 2mg/l. resistance to rifampin was very unusual and all pneumococcal isolates were fully susceptible to glycopeptides.

AB  == putative n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase genes from lambdasa1 and lambdasa2 prophages of streptococcus agalactiae were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the purified enzymes lysed the cell walls of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the peptidoglycan digestion  products in the cell wall lysates were not consistent with amidase activity. instead, the structure of the muropeptide digestion fragments indicated that both the lambdasa1 and lambdasa2 lysins exhibited gamma-d-glutaminyl-l-lysine endopeptidase activity. the endopeptidase cleavage specificity of the lysins was  confirmed using a synthetic peptide substrate corresponding to a portion of the stem peptide and cross bridge of streptococcus agalactiae peptidoglycan. the lambdasa2 lysin also displayed beta-d-n-acetylglucosaminidase activity.

TI  == genetic relatedness of the streptococcus pneumoniae capsular biosynthetic loci.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) produces 1 of 91 capsular polysaccharides (cps) that define the serotype. the cps loci of 88 pneumococcal serotypes whose cps is synthesized by the wzy-dependent pathway were compared with each other and with additional streptococcal polysaccharide biosynthetic loci and were clustered according to the proportion of shared homology groups (hgs), weighted for the sequence similarities between the genes encoding the shared hgs. the cps loci of the 88 pneumococcal serotypes were distributed into eight major clusters and 21 subclusters. all serotypes within the same serogroup  fell into the same major cluster, but in six cases, serotypes within the same serogroup were in different subclusters and, conversely, nine subclusters included completely different serotypes. the closely related cps loci within a subcluster were compared to the known cps structures to relate gene content to structure. the streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis polysaccharide biosynthetic loci clustered within the pneumococcal cps loci and were in a subcluster that also included the cps locus of pneumococcal serotype 21, whereas  the streptococcus agalactiae cps loci formed a single cluster that was not closely related to any of the pneumococcal cps clusters.

TI  == comparative genomic analyses of seventeen streptococcus pneumoniae strains: insights into the pneumococcal supragenome.
AB  == the distributed-genome hypothesis (dgh) states that pathogenic bacteria possess a supragenome that is much larger than the genome of any single bacterium and that  these pathogens utilize genetic recombination and a large, noncore set of genes as a means of diversity generation. we sequenced the genomes of eight nasopharyngeal strains of streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from pediatric patients with upper respiratory symptoms and performed quantitative genomic analyses among these and nine publicly available pneumococcal strains. coding sequences from all strains were grouped into 3,170 orthologous gene clusters, of  which 1,454 (46%) were conserved among all 17 strains. the majority of the gene clusters, 1,716 (54%), were not found in all strains. genic differences per strain pair ranged from 35 to 629 orthologous clusters, with each strain's genome containing between 21 and 32% noncore genes. the distribution of the orthologous  clusters per genome for the 17 strains was entered into the finite-supragenome model, which predicted that (i) the s. pneumoniae supragenome contains more than  5,000 orthologous clusters and (ii) 99% of the orthologous clusters ( approximately 3,000) that are represented in the s. pneumoniae population at frequencies of >or=0.1 can be identified if 33 representative genomes are sequenced. these extensive genic diversity data support the dgh and provide a basis for understanding the great differences in clinical phenotype associated with various pneumococcal strains. when these findings are taken together with previous studies that demonstrated the presence of a supragenome for streptococcus agalactiae and haemophilus influenzae, it appears that the possession of a distributed genome is a common host interaction strategy.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == a composite transposon associated with erythromycin and clindamycin resistance in group b streptococcus.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin has been isolated with increasing frequency since the mid-1990s. this work studied gbs isolates from three us cities to determine the genetic basis of the macrolide resistance phenotype. ermb genes were amplified from five isolates collected in boston, pittsburgh and seattle from infant and adult sources. gene-walking methods were used to determine the chromosomal location of ermb and to identify associated genes. southern mapping and random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analyses were used to distinguish the isolates. the ermb gene was present on the  chromosome within a composite tn917/tn916-like transposon similar to one identified in streptococcus pneumoniae. four strains from boston and pittsburgh were serotype v and identical by southern hybridization and rapd analysis. the seattle isolate was serotype ib, with different patterns on rapd analysis and southern mapping. the composite transposon was integrated at an identical chromosomal site in all five isolates. the presence of this composite transposon  in both gbs and pneumococci suggests that ermb-mediated macrolide resistance in streptococci may be due to the horizontal transfer of a mobile transposable element, and raises concern for further dissemination of high-grade erythromycin  and clindamycin resistance among streptococcal species.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

TI  == role of ionic interactions and linker in the domain interaction and modulation of functional activity of hyaluronate lyases.
AB  == hyaluronate lyases from streptococcus pneumoniae (spnhl) and streptococcus agalactiae (saghl) are composed of four domains; n-terminal domain, spacer domain, alpha-domain and c-terminal domain, which are connected through peptide linkers. we have earlier shown that the recombinant alpha- and c-terminal domains of spnhl/saghl interact with each other even in absence of the linker and form a  functional complex with enhanced enzymatic activity. here, we looked into the role of ionic interactions in the enzyme stability and also the role of c-terminal domain and linker in the functional regulation. domain swapping studies showed that the c-terminal domain does not bind directly to the substrate; instead the domain contributes to the interaction with the polymeric hyaluronan for catalysis. furthermore, the substrate specificity exchanges with the size of catalytic cleft. the role of linker connecting alpha-domain to c-terminal domain was found to hold the c-terminal domain in a conformation suitable for achieving maximum activity.

TI  == gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  == bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (lgt) is  a predominant force in bacterial evolution. to better understand the significance of lgt, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal  genomes using a maximum likelihood method. this study indicates that the rate of  gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each  species. we have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by lgt and conclude that at least  a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.

TI  == dna methylase activity as a marker for the presence of a family of phage-like elements conferring efflux-mediated macrolide resistance in streptococci.
AB  == recently, two related chimeric genetic elements (tn1207.3 and phi10394.4) were shown to carry the macrolide efflux gene mef in streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci [gas]). the dissemination of elements belonging to the tn1207.3/phi10394.4 family in recent isolates of gas, streptococcus dysgalactiae  subsp. equisimilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae recovered in portugal was surveyed. in total, 149 gas, 18 s. pneumoniae, 4 s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and 5 s. agalactiae isolates from infections, presenting the m phenotype of macrolide resistance and containing the mef gene, were screened for the presence of tn1207.3/phi10394.4 by pcr targeting open reading frames (orfs) specific for these related elements. all the gas isolates tested and one of the s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates carried tn1207.3. however, neither of these elements was found in the isolates of the other streptococcal species. it was also noted that the dnas of the isolates carrying tn1207.3 were resistant to cleavage by the endonuclease smai. cloning and expression of orf12 of tn1207.3 in escherichia coli showed that it encoded a  methyltransferase that rendered dna refractory to cleavage by smai (m.spy10394i). using this characteristic as a marker for the presence of the tn1207.3/phi10394.4 family, we reviewed the literature and concluded that these genetic elements are  widely distributed among tetracycline-susceptible gas isolates presenting the m phenotype from diverse geographic origins and may have played an important role in the dissemination of macrolide resistance in this species.

TI  == novel 6-o-acylated vitamin c derivatives as hyaluronidase inhibitors with selectivity for bacterial lyases.
AB  == previously, we identified ascorbic acid 6-o-hexadecanoate as an up to 1500 times  more potent inhibitor of bacterial and bovine hyaluronidases than the parent compound, vitamin c, and determined a crystal structure of hyaluronidase from streptococcus pneumoniae in complex with the inhibitor. as the alkanoyl chain interacts with a hydrophobic patch of the enzyme we synthesized other 6-o-acylated vitamin c derivatives bearing various lipophilic residues and investigated the inhibition of streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hyaluronidase (saghyal(4755)) and of bovine testicular hyaluronidases (bth) in a turbidimetric  assay. all compounds showed selectivity for the bacterial enzyme. whereas vitamin c 6-o-hexanoate only weakly inhibited saghyal(4755), the inhibition of both enzymes increased with the length of the aliphatic chain. in the case of the 6-o-octadecanoate, ic(50) values of 0.9 and 39microm for saghyal(4755) and bth, respectively, were determined. partial replacement of the aliphatic chain with a  phenyl, p-phenylene or p-biphenylyl group resulted in inhibitors with activity in the lower micromolar range, too. the title compounds are among the most potent inhibitors of both enzymes known to date.

TI  == [clinical effect of continuous infusion of meropenem on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly].
AB  == we studied the clinical effect of continuous infusion over 24 hours of meropenem  (mepm) on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly (over 65). the subjects were 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, n = 9; severe, n= 4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group iii, n = 13) whose performance status was 3 or 4. mepm 1.0g/day was infused continuously for 7-14 days, and its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy, and side effects were examined prospectively. it was effective in 23 of the 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, 8/9; severe, 3/4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group iii, 12/13; efficacy rate: 88.5%). bactericidal effects were obtained in 3 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of methicillin-sensitive staphlococcus aureus, 1 strain of streptococcus agalactiae  and 1 strain of proteus mirabilis, but not in 2 strains of methicillin-resistant  s. aureus, 1 strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1 strain of serratia marcescens. mild abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 2 patients: elevation of gpt, gamma-gtp, bun and elevation of alp. based on the above, continuous infusion of mepm on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly obtained excellent clinical effects. further study is needed to compare the efficacy of continuous versus intermittent administration of mepm.

TI  == [use of transport medium in sputum bacterial culture examination of lower airway  infection].
AB  == our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. due to the time elapsed from the time of  specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. we therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. we divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together.  the time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). the identified causative bacteria were streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), haemophilus influenzae (n =5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. the utility of transport medium for examination of general  bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. the rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.

TI  == capillary isoelectric focusing of microorganisms in the ph range 2-5 in a dynamically modified fs capillary with uv detection.
AB  == the isoelectric points of many microbial cells lie within the ph range spanning from 1.5 to 4.5. in this work, we suggest a cief method for the separation of cells according to their isoelectric points in the ph range of 2-5. it includes the segmental injection of the sample pulse composed of the segment of the selected simple ampholytes, the segment of the bioanalytes and the segment of carrier ampholytes into fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene glycole). this polymer dissolved in the catholyte, in the anolyte and in the injected sample pulse was used for a prevention of the bioanalyte adsorption on the capillary surface and for the reduction of the electroosmotic flow. between each focusing run, the capillaries were washed with the mixture of  acetone/ethanol to achieve the reproducible and efficient cief. in order to trace of ph gradients, low-molecular-mass pi markers were used. the mixed cultures of microorganisms, escherichia coli ccm 3954, candida albicans ccm 8180, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis, ccm 8223, proteus vulgaris, klebsiela pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus ccm 3953, streptococcus agalactiae ccm 6187, enterococcus faecalis ccm 4224 and staphylococcus epidermidis ccm 4418, were focused and separated by the cief method suggested here. this cief method enables the separation and detection of the microbes from the mixed cultures within several minutes. the minimum detectable number of microbial cells was less than 10(3).

TI  == group b streptococcal bacteremia in non-pregnant adults.
AB  == background and purpose: an increasing incidence of group b streptococcus (gbs) infection in non-pregnant adults has been noted in recent years. to understand the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of gbs bacteremia in non-pregnant adults, we conducted a retrospective study at a tertiary teaching hospital in taiwan. methods: this retrospective analysis included 94 non-pregnant adults (age >/=18 years) with gbs bacteremia hospitalized between january 2001 and december 2003. results: the incidence of gbs bacteremia increased from 0.16 cases/1000 admissions in 2001 to 0.30 cases/1000 admissions in 2003 (p=0.017, chi-squared test for trend). the mean age of patients was 64.7 +/- 1.39 years. at least 1 underlying systemic disease was found in 81% of patients, with the most frequent being malignancy (43.6%), diabetes mellitus (42.6%), and liver cirrhosis (16%). the 2 major clinical syndromes were primary bacteremia (34%) and soft tissue infection (31.9%). the overall mortality rate was 20.2%. staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae were the 2 most common concurrently isolated bloodstream pathogens. polymicrobial bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, and shock were independent risk factors for mortality in gbs bacteremia. conclusions: the increasing incidence of gbs bacteremia is noteworthy, especially among patients with invasive infections. these infections are also responsible for substantial mortality in elderly patients with underlying diseases. susceptibility testing indicated that penicillin g remains the drug of choice for gbs bacteremia.

TI  == functional analysis of glucan binding protein b from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == mutans streptococci are major etiological agents of dental caries, and several of their secreted products contribute to bacterial accumulation on teeth. of these,  streptococcus mutans glucan binding protein b (gbpb) is a novel, immunologically  dominant protein. its biological function is unclear, although gbpb shares homology with a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase from s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, indicative of a role in murein biosynthesis. to determine the cellular function of gbpb, we used several approaches to inactivate the gene, analyze its expression, and identify interacting proteins. none of the transformants analyzed were true gbpb mutants, since they all contained both disrupted and wild-type gene copies, and expression of functional gbpb was always conserved. thus, the inability to obtain viable gbpb null mutants supports the notion that gbpb is an essential gene. northern blot and real-time pcr analyses suggested that induction of gbpb expression in response to stress was a strain-dependent phenomenon. proteins that interacted with gbpb were identified in pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, and these data suggest that gbpb interacts with ribosomal protein l7/l12, possibly as part of a protein complex involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and cell division.

TI  == understanding the bacterial polysaccharide antigenicity of streptococcus agalactiae versus streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == bacterial surface capsular polysaccharides (cps) that are similar in carbohydrate sequence may differ markedly in immunogenicity and antigenicity. the structural origin of these phenomena is poorly understood. such a case is presented by the gram-positive bacteria streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus; gbs) type iii (gbsiii) and streptococcus pneumoniae (pn) type 14 (pn14), which share closely related cps sequences. nevertheless, antibodies (abs) against gbsiii rarely cross-react with the cps from pn14. to establish the origin for the variation in cps antigenicity, models for the immune complexes of cps fragments from gbsiii and pn14, with the variable fragment (fv) of a gbs-specific mab (mab  1b1), are presented. the complexes are generated through a combination of comparative ab modeling and automated ligand docking, followed by explicitly solvated 10-ns molecular dynamics simulations. the relationship between carbohydrate sequence and antigenicity is further quantified through the computation of interaction energies using the molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area (mm-gbsa) method, augmented by conformational entropy estimates. despite the electrostatic differences between pn14 and gbsiii cps, analysis indicates that entropic penalties are primarily responsible for the loss of affinity of the highly flexible pn14 cps for mab 1b1. the similarity of the solution conformation of the relatively rigid gbsiii cps with that in the immune  complex characterizes the previously undescribed 3d structure of the conformational epitope. the analysis provides a comprehensive interpretation for  a large body of biochemical and immunological data related to ab recognition of bacterial polysaccharides and should be applicable to other ab-carbohydrate interactions.

TI  == design of new benzoxazole-2-thione-derived inhibitors of streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronan lyase: structure of a complex with a 2-phenylindole.
AB  == the bacterial hyaluronan lyases (hyals) that degrade hyaluronan, an important component of the extracellular matrix, are involved in microbial spread. inhibitors of these enzymes are essential in investigation of the role of hyaluronan and hyal in bacterial infections and constitute a new class of antibiotics against hyal-producing bacteria. recently, we identified 1,3-diacetylbenzimidazole-2-thione and related molecules as inhibitors of streptococcal hyal. one of such compounds, 1-decyl-2-(4-sulfamoyloxyphenyl)-1-indol-6-yl sulfamate, was co-crystallized in a complex with streptococcus pneumoniae hyal and its structure elucidated. the resultant x-ray structure demonstrates that this inhibitor fits in the enzymatic  active site via interactions resembling the binding mode of the natural hyaluronan substrate. x-ray structural analysis also indicates binding interactions with the catalytic residues and those of a catalytically essential hydrophobic patch. an ic50 value of 11 microm for hyal from streptococcus agalactiae (strain 4755) qualifies this phenylindole compound as one of the most  potent hyal inhibitors known to date. the structural data suggested a similar binding mode for n-(3-phenylpropionyl)-benzoxazole-2-thione. this new compound's  inhibitory properties were confirmed resulting in discovery of yet another hyal inhibitor (ic50 of 15 microm). these benzoxazole-2-thiones constitute a new class of inhibitors of bacterial hyals and are well suited for further optimization of  their selectivity, potency, and pharmacokinetic properties.

TI  == alternate structural conformations of streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronan lyase:  insights into enzyme flexibility and underlying molecular mechanism of action.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronan lyase is a surface enzyme of this gram-positive bacterium. the enzyme degrades several biologically important, information-rich linear polymeric glycans: hyaluronan, unsulfated chondroitin, and some chondroitin sulfates. this degradation facilitates spreading of bacteria throughout the host tissues and presumably provides energy and a carbon source for pneumococcal cells. its beta-elimination catalytic mechanism is an acid/base  process termed proton acceptance and donation leading to cleavage of beta-1,4 linkages of the substrates. the degradation of hyaluronan occurs in two stages, initial endolytic cuts are followed by processive exolytic cleavage of one disaccharide at a time. in contrast, the degradation of chondroitins is purely endolytic. structural studies together with flexibility analyses of two streptococcal enzymes, from s.pneumoniae and streptococcus agalactiae, allowed for insights into this enzyme's molecular mechanism. here, two new x-ray crystal  structures of the pneumococcal enzyme in novel conformations are reported. these  new conformations, complemented by molecular dynamics simulation results, directly confirm the predicted domain motions presumed to facilitate the processive degradative process. one of these new structures resembles the s.agalactiae enzyme conformation, and provides evidence of a uniform mechanistic/dynamic behavior of this protein across different bacteria.

AB  == beta-hemolytic streptococci are common bacterial pathogens that can cause serious invasive disease, and although this group of species has remained susceptible to  the fluoroquinolone class, resistant strains have been reported. this multicenter investigation determined the rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci using the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program network data (1997-2004). forty-seven surveillance culture isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci from north america and europe with elevated levofloxacin mic results (2 to >32) microg/ml were tested for susceptibility to other fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin, garenoxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin using reference broth microdilution and etest (biodisk, solna, sweden) methods. strains were characterized using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing to detect mutations in the quinolone-resistance determining region (qrdr). the beta-hemolytic streptococci isolates with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility included the following lancefield groups: a (streptococcus pyogenes; 9 strains), b (streptococcus agalactiae; 24 strains), c and g (14 strains). vitek and api 20 strep (biomerieux, hazelwood, mo) identification systems, as well as conventional biochemical methods and colony morphology, were  used to confirm the organism identifications. the overall potency (mic90 in microg/ml) for the fluoroquinolones against all tested beta-hemolytic streptococci showed the following rank order: gemifloxacin (0.06) > garenoxacin (0.12) > moxifloxacin (0.25) > gatifloxacin (0.5) > levofloxacin = ciprofloxacin  (1). the rate of levofloxacin-resistant beta-hemolytic streptococci in the sentry program was 0.14% (europe) and 0.51% (north america) during the study period. all levofloxacin-resistant strains tested by molecular methods had significant mutations in either parc (position 79 or 83) and/or gyra (position 81 or 85). all but 2 isolates with high-level resistance to levofloxacin (>32 microg/ml) had gyra mutations. strains with lower mic values to levofloxacin (2-4 microg/ml) only had mutations in parc. the increasing rate of fluoroquinolone-resistant streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and the more recently reported beta-hemolytic streptococci, is becoming a clinical concern due to the morbidity and mortality caused by these pathogens.

TI  == c-jun kinase is a critical signaling molecule in a neonatal model of group b streptococcal sepsis.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) is the major cause of sepsis in newborn infants. in vitro, inactivated gbs stimulates macrophages to produce inflammatory proteins via the tlr adapter protein myd88. furthermore, inflammatory cytokine release in  response to gbs greatly exceeds that following stimulation with pneumococci. in this study, we attempted to unravel signaling events that are involved in gbs-, but not streptococcus pneumoniae-stimulated phagocytes to identify molecular targets for adjunctive sepsis therapy. we found that inactivated gbs and s. pneumoniae differed in the activation of the mapk jnk, but not ikappab kinase. furthermore, jnk was essential for the transcriptional activation of inflammatory cytokine genes in response to gbs. inhibition of jnk by the anthrapyrazolone sp600125 abrogated gbs-induced cytokine formation via an ap-1- and nf-kappab-dependent mechanism without impairing antibacterial properties such as  phagocytosis of gbs and the formation of intracellular oxidative species. in contrast, inhibition of the mapk p38 impaired both antibacterial processes. in a  neonatal mouse model of gbs sepsis sp600125 inhibited the inflammatory response and improved survival. in conclusion, jnk plays a major role in the inflammatory, but not in the direct antibacterial response to inactivated gbs, and may thus serve as a rational target for an adjunctive gbs sepsis therapy.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates from the global tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program, 2004).
AB  == tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. to determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test program) commenced in 2003. this study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. tigecycline was the most active agent tested against gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. mic90 results (microg/ml) for tigecycline against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. tigecycline was active against enterobacteriaceae with an mic90 of 1 microg/ml. haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an mic90 of only 0.25 microg/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the  least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. tigecycline appears to be  a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens  with varying resistance phenotypes.

TI  == genomic subtraction followed by dot blot screening of streptococcus pneumoniae clinical and carriage isolates identifies genetic differences associated with strains that cause otitis media.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae strains are the leading cause of bacterial otitis media, yet little is known about specific bacterial factors important for this disease.  we utilized a molecular epidemiological approach involving genomic subtraction of the s. pneumoniae serogroup 19 middle ear strain 5093 against the laboratory strain r6. resulting subtraction pcr (spcr) products were used to screen a panel  of 93 middle ear, 90 blood, 35 carriage, and 58 cerebrospinal fluid isolates from young children to identify genes found more frequently among middle ear isolates. probe p41, similar to a hypothetical protein of brucella melitensis, occurred among 41% of middle ear isolates and was found 2.8 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.32 to 6.5), 3.3 (95% ci, 1.9 to 5.7), and 1.8 (95% ci, 1.1 to 3.0) times more frequently among middle ear strains than carriage, blood, or meningitis strains,  respectively. spcr fragment h10, similar to an unknown streptococcus agalactiae protein, was present in 31% of middle ear isolates and occurred 3.6 (95% ci, 1.2  to 11.2), 2.8 (95% ci, 1.5 to 5.4), and 2.6 (95% ci, 1.2 to 5.5) times more often among middle ear isolates than carriage, blood, or meningitis strains, respectively. these studies have identified two genes of potential importance in  otitis media virulence. further studies are warranted to outline the precise role of these genes in otitis media pathogenesis.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  == we compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (ccl), cefroxadine (cxd), cefdinir (cfdn), cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefteram (cftm), cefcapene (cfpn), and cefditoren (cdtr), against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and esbl-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in kansai medical university hospital between 2002 and 2003. based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above mic (tam) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. in s. pneumoniae strains, the mic(50,80,90) values of cdtr were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the  most potent antimicrobial activity. however, the efficacy rate for cdtr calculated based on the pk/pd theory was 58.5%. cftm showed the highest efficacy  rate (66.1%). in h. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of cdtr was most potent, followed by that of cftm and that of cfpn/cfix. the mic90 value of cdtr was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of cftm (0.5 microg/ml). the efficacy rate for cdtr was 100%. this result supports that cdtr frequently eradicates h. influenzae. in e. coli strains, the mic90 values of the above agents, excluding ccl and cxd, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. the antimicrobial  activity of cfix against k. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of cfdn/cpdx and that of cftm. in esbl-producing bacteria, most agents showed an mic90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. in s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory mic values. in methi- cillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) strains, cfdn and cxd showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. the frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. esbl-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be  readily evaluated. however, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (pbp) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. in s. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the pk/pd theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the pk/pd theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.

TI  == surveillance of linezolid resistance in germany, 2001-2002.
AB  == a surveillance study was performed throughout germany from november 2001 to june  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for mic determination. susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. the prevalence of  linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in streptococcus agalactiae. linezolid resistance was not detected in streptococcus pneumoniae or  in viridans group streptococci. sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (mic90, 1-2 mg/l). the prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in germany. organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an  alternative method or in a reference laboratory.

TI  == patterns of sequence divergence in 5' intergenic spacers and linked coding regions in 10 species of pathogenic bacteria reveal distinct recombinational histories.
AB  == we compared the pattern of nucleotide difference in 8034 genes and in their 5' intergenic spacers between conspecific pairs of genomes from 10 species of pathogenic bacteria. certain genes or spacers showed much greater sequence divergence between the genotypes compared to others; such divergent regions plausibly originated by recombinational events by which a gene and/or spacers was donated from a divergent genome. different patterns of divergence in genes and spacers identified different recombinational patterns. for example, in chlamydophila pneumoniae, there were examples of both unusually divergent spacers and unusually divergent genes, but there were no cases in which a gene and its spacer were both unusually divergent. this pattern suggests that, in c. pneumoniae, recombination events have broken up the linkage between genes and 5'  spacers. by contrast, in streptococcus agalactiae, there were a number of cases in which both spacer and gene were unusually divergent, indicating that a number  of large-scale recombination events that included both genes and 5' spacers have  occurred; there was evidence of at least two large-scale recombination events in  the genomic region including the pur genes in s. agalactiae.

TI  == brain-derived neurotrophic factor protects against multiple forms of brain injury in bacterial meningitis.
AB  == background: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) blocks activation of caspase-3, reduces translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (aif), attenuates excitotoxicity of glutamate, and increases antioxidant enzyme activities. the mechanisms of neuroprotection suggest that bdnf may be beneficial in bacterial meningitis. methods: to assess a potentially beneficial effect of adjuvant treatment with bdnf in bacterial meningitis, 11-day-old infant rats with experimental meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae or group b streptococci (gbs) were randomly assigned to receive intracisternal injections with either bdnf (3 mg/kg) or equal volumes (10 mu l) of saline. twenty-two hours after infection, brains were analyzed, by histomorphometrical examination, for the extent of cortical and hippocampal neuronal injury. results: compared with treatment with saline, treatment with bdnf significantly reduced the extent of 3  distinct forms of brain cell injury in this disease model: cortical necrosis in meningitis due to gbs (median, 0.0% [range, 0.0%-33.7%] vs. 21.3% [range, 0.0%-55.3%]; p<.03), caspase-3-dependent cell death in meningitis due to s. pneumoniae (median score, 0.33 [range, 0.0-1.0] vs. 1.10 [0.10-1.56]; p<.05), and caspase-3-independent hippocampal cell death in meningitis due to gbs (median score, 0 [range, 0-2] vs. 0.88 [range, 0-3.25]; p<.02). the last form of injury was associated with nuclear translocation of aif. conclusion: bdnf efficiently reduces multiple forms of neuronal injury in bacterial meningitis and may hold promise as adjunctive therapy for this disease.

AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == bacterial capsular polysaccharide and sugar transferases.
AB  == capsular polysaccharides (cps) of several pathogenic bacteria are thought to be good materials for the development of new therapeutic reagents. these polysaccharides can be used as vaccines against infection of pathogenic bacteria  and are also useful as inhibitors for disease caused by aberrant and abnormal cell-cell interaction, such as cancer metastasis and inflammation. since bacterial cps are diverse in structure and these bacteria have a variety of sugar transferases responsible for the synthesis of cps, bacterial cp synthesis (cps) genes have attracted much interest as a source of glycosyltransferases useful for glycoengineering. in this review, we describe physiological effects of the bacterial cps on mammalian cells, and the structure and function of the cps genes, by focusing on group b streptococci, streptococcus agalactiae type ia and  ib, that produce high-molecular weight polysaccharides consisting of the following pentasaccharide repeating units: -->4)-[alpha-d-neupnac-(2-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->4)-beta-d-glcpnac-(1-->3)]-beta-d -galp-(1-->4)-beta-d-glcp-(1--> and -->4)-[alpha-d-neupnac-(2-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->3)-beta-d-glcpnac-(1-->3)]-beta-d -galp-(1-->4)beta-d-glcp-(1-->, respectively.

TI  == seasonal evaluation of antigenic bacterial infections among working class in the  inner city of houston.
AB  == this paper evaluates the monthly, quarterly, and seasonal variation of antigenic  bacterial infections among the working class in the inner city of houston using the wellcogen rapid test methods. one of the aims was to demonstrate how this method could be used effectively in screening patients at risk and preventing the spread of antigenic bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae b, streptococcus (strep b), and neisseria meningitidis (mainly group c and b). a total of 2,837 patients were screened for bacterial infections; 908 (32%) were male and 1,929 (68%) were female. the age range was between 2 and 70 years. of the total group, 356 (12.5%) patients were positive; 203 (57%) were female while 153 (43%) were male (male/female ratio of 1:1.3). medically underserved and immune suppressed populations are the most affected by these bacterial infections. blacks are the most affected (48%) compared to native americans (1%), but children under 10 years of age have the highest incidence. this research showed, in addition, that the wellcogen rapid tests are effective (356 cases identified) for a rapid screening of infectious bacteria. explanation  for these results was probably due to poor living conditions, poor hygiene, and viral immune suppression in adults and immature immune systems in neonates and children under 10 years of age.

AB  == hyaluronidases are enzymes that degrade hyaluronan, an important component of the extracellular matrix. the mammalian hyaluronidases are considered to be involved  in many (patho)physiological processes like fertilization, tumor growth, and metastasis. bacterial hyaluronidases, also termed hyaluronate lyases, contribute  to the spreading of microorganisms in tissues. such roles for hyaluronidases suggest that inhibitors could be useful pharmacological tools. potent and selective inhibitors are not known to date, although l-ascorbic acid has been reported to be a weak inhibitor of streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (spnhl). the x-ray structure of spnhl complexed with l-ascorbic acid has been elucidated suggesting that additional hydrophobic interactions might increase inhibitory activity. here we show that l-ascorbic acid 6-hexadecanoate (vcpal) is a potent inhibitor of both streptococcal and bovine testicular hyaluronidase (bth). vcpal showed strong inhibition of streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase with an ic(50) of 4 microm and weaker inhibition of spnhl and bth with ic(50) values of 100 and 56 microm, respectively. to date, vcpal has proved to be one of the most potent inhibitors of hyaluronidase. we also determined the x-ray  structure of the spnhl-vcpal complex and confirmed the hypothesis that additional hydrophobic interactions with phe-343, his-399, and thr-400 in the active site led to increased inhibition. a homology structural model of bth was also generated to suggest binding modes of vcpal to this hyaluronidase. the long alkyl chain seemed to interact with an extended, hydrophobic channel formed by mostly conserved amino acids ala-84, leu-91, tyr-93, tyr-220, and leu-344 in bth.

TI  == defective cell wall synthesis in streptococcus pneumoniae r6 depleted for the essential pcsb putative murein hydrolase or the vicr (yycf) response regulator.
AB  == pcsb is a protein of unknown function(s) that influences the cell morphology of several pathogenic species of streptococcus. pcsb contains a chap (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase) domain found in bacterial murein hydrolases; however, direct links between steps in cell wall biosynthesis and pcsb function(s) have not been demonstrated. we show here that pcsb is essential  in the human respiratory pathogen, streptococcus pneumoniae, that depletion of pcsb is bacteriostatic and that alanine substitutions in the conserved cysteine and histidine residues of the chap domain appear to be lethal. we stained wild-type parent and mutant bacteria deficient in expression of pcsb with fluorescent vancomycin and dapi to determine patterns of cell wall synthesis and  nucleoid segregation respectively. the wild-type parent strain exhibited ordered, simultaneous septal and equatorial cell wall synthesis. in contrast, reduced expression of pcsb resulted in formation of long chains of cells in which peptidoglycan synthesis occurred at nearly every division septum and cell equator. severe depletion of pcsb led to abnormal, uncontrolled cell wall synthesis at misplaced septa and around large cells. together, these physiological properties are consistent with a role for pcsb as a murein hydrolase that balances the extent of cell wall synthesis in s. pneumoniae. finally, we show that the defects in morphology and cell wall synthesis that result from depletion of pcsb strongly resemble those caused by depletion of the  essential vicrk two component regulatory system (tcs). this result and the essentiality of pcsb support the hypothesis that the essentiality of the vicrk tcs results from its positive regulation of pcsb expression.

TI  == [epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in france in 2002].
AB  == in france, two sources of data, the mandatory notification and the hospital laboratory network epibac, allow the health authorities to monitor the incidence  of bacterial meningitis. in 2002 around 1,500 cases were estimated in france. the more common microorganisms were: streptococcus pneumoniae 49% (incidence 1.19/100,000), neisseria meningitidis 33% (incidence 0.83) and streptococcus agalactiae (streptococcus b) 11% (incidence 0.27). listeria monocytogenes accounted for 4% of the cases (incidence 0.11) and haemophilus influenzae accounted for 3% (incidence 0.08). trends in incidence showed an increase of meningococci meningitis since 1996, a steady decrease of h. influenzae and listeria meningitis since 1992, and a quasi stable number of pneumococci meningitis, streptococci b meningitis and tuberculosis meningitis in the last 10  years. the impact of preventive measures on the incidence of listeria meningitis  and h. influenzae b meningitis has been clearly demonstrated through the dramatic decrease of meningitis due to these microorganisms.

TI  == comparative genomics of streptococcal species.
AB  == microbial genome sequencing has produced an unprecedented amount of new information and insights into an organism's metabolic activities, virulence properties, and evolution. the complete genome sequence has been reported for four different species of streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae and s. mutans. comparative genome analysis among organisms of the same species not only shows a high degree of similarity in gene  content and organization, but also a high degree of sequence heterogeneity as evidenced by the large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms present. considerable differences were also observed in the number of mobile genetic elements found in each organism, including complete and partial bacteriophage genomes, is elements, transposons, and plasmids. s. pyogenes was the only species to contain complete bacteriophage genomes in its genome, while only s. pneumoniae and s. mutans contained the full complement of competence genes essential for natural transformation. comparative genome analysis between the species showed that s. pyogenes was more closely related to s. agalactiae than with s. pneumoniae or s. mutans.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the effect and safety of the specific immunoglobulin y (igy) for treatment of acute and chronic pharyngitis. methods: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 50 adults with acute pharyngitis. experimental group received a 6 times-daily total 30 doses of igy stomat-spray which contained specific immunoglobulin y (titer = 512) prepared from the egg yolk of hens immunized with a variety of bacteria. another open label trial included 50 patients, whose ages ranged from 21-69 years, including 25 cases of acute pharyngitis and 25 cases of chronic pharyngitis were also treated using igy stomat-spray. the therapeutic effect were objectively evaluated 7 days later by the decreased scores based on both the symptoms and physical signs. if the symptom did not improve or became severe three days later, these patients with acute pharyngitis was inefficiency and antibiotic medicine would be added to them. results: in double-blind trial, 8 cases (32%) received igy had apparent effect with the decreased scores 5 or more than 5, 13 cases (52%) had effective with the decreased scores 3-4, and other 4 cases (16%) had inefficacy with the decreased scores only 2 or no more than 2. while in placebo-controlled group, only 2 (8%) cases had apparent effect, 5 (20%) cases showed effective and  18 (72%) cases had non-effect. the difference between the two groups was significant (chi 2 = 16.06, p < 0.01). in open label trial, 19 cases (38%) showed apparent effect, in which 14 cases were acute pharygitis. 23 cases (46%) had effective, in which 10 cases were acute pharyngitis. the left 8 cases (16%) had ineffective, in which one case was acute pharyngitis. there was significantly difference (chi 2 = 8.90, p < 0.05) between acute pharyngitis and chronic pharyngitis. an average of three months followup showed that there were no side effect or toxic effect and no allergic reaction. conclusion: the igy stomat-spray is a safe and effective agent in treating acute and chronic pharyngitis, especially for acute pharyngitis.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == zebrafish as a model host for streptococcal pathogenesis.
AB  == streptococcal pathogens continue to evade concerted efforts to determine clear-cut virulence mechanisms, although numerous genes have been implicated in pathogenesis. a single species can infect a diversity of tissues, suggesting the  expression of specific virulence factors based on the local tissue environment or stage of infection. in an effort to identify the interactions that occur between  the host and pathogen that lead to activation of virulence mechanisms and contribute to specific streptococcal disease states, we have developed a unique animal model, the zebrafish (danio rerio), to characterize specific virulence mechanisms utilized within various tissues in vivo. we are using this model host  to study infection by two streptococcal species that represent two forms of streptococcal disease: a natural pathogen of fish and humans, streptococcus iniae and a human-specific pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes. s. iniae primarily causes  a fatal systemic disease in the zebrafish following intra-muscular injection, with similar pathologies to that seen in human infections caused by streptococcus agalactiae and s. pneumoniae. while the fatal infection by s. pyogenes causes a locally spreading necrotic disease confined to the muscle with pathology similar  to what is observed in a human infection of necrotizing fasciitis. by studying pathogens that are virulent for both fish and humans and that mediate disease states in the zebrafish that are identical to those found in human streptococcal  infections, we will be able to identify common virulence strategies shared by a number of gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == efficacy and tolerability assessment of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media.
AB  == young children contract as many as six to eight upper respiratory tract viral infections per year, and these infections frequently lead to secondary bacterial  infections such as acute otitis media and sinusitis. cefprozil is an orally active third generation cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against the gram-positive organisms streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicilin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefprozil is also active against various gram-ves and certain anaerobic organisms, and is stable to hydrolysis by a number of b-lactamases. present study is an effort to study the efficacy and safety of cefprozil in children with acute otitis media. three hundred and thirty four children aged 6 months through 12 years with clinical symptoms and tympanic membrane signs of aom received cefprozil 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses per day for 10 days. clinically, 96.6% patients were cured, 2.4% improved and there was failure of therapy in 1% of the patients. there was no need for any rescue medication and any change in antibiotic in any patient. a  satisfactory bacteriological outcome was (i.e. cure, presumed cure, and cure plus reinfection with a different pathogen) was achieved in 95% of patients. in conclusion, cefprozil is a well tolerated and effective drug for acute otitis media in children. moreover, its expanded spectrum of activity, ability to achieve adequate concentrations in tissues, suitability for twice-daily dosing, and proven tolerability suggest that it is a better alternative to agents conventionally used in acute otitis media.

TI  == correlation of antigenic epitope and antibody gene usage in the human immune response to streptococcus pneumoniae type 23f capsular polysaccharide.
AB  == the human antibody response to the capsular polysaccharide of streptococcus pneumoniae type 23f is predominated by antibodies which express either vkappal6 or vkappaa23 light chain genes. in this report, we demonstrate that the antigenic epitopes recognized by these two families can be differentiated based on their specificity for the hapten l-rhamnose, a constituent sugar of the bacterial capsule polymer. the vkappal6 family utilizes light chains with an unusually long third complementarity-determining region. these vkappal6-encoded fabs are 100-fold more sensitive to inhibition with l-rhamnose than vkappaa23 fabs. vkappal6 fabs preferentially recognize the l-isomer of the hapten and can distinguish l-rhamnose from the structurally similar sugar l-mannose. we also demonstrate that the vkappal6 family component of the antibody response recognizes the polysaccharide antigens of group b streptococci (gbs), thereby accounting for the previously reported cross-reaction between pps 23f-specific antisera and group b streptococci.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by u.s. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  == background: bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. the widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (cns) pathogens is important to define current prevalence  of resistance. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from cns specimens was analyzed using the surveillance database (tsn) usa database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 us hospital laboratories. a total of 6029 organisms derived from cns specimen sources during  2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. results: staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. the modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. prevalence of mrsa among s. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for s. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for s. agalactiae. for csf isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was s. pneumoniae (3.5%), e. coli (0.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), serratia marcescens (5.6%), enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), haemophilus influenzae (0%). listeria monocytogenes and n. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. conclusions: resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. this data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat cns infections.

TI  == the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections: from tooth decay to meningitis.
AB  == the development of bacterial disease has been likened to a 'molecular arms race', in which the host tries to eliminate the bacteria, while the bacteria try to survive in the host. although most bacteria do not cause disease, some cause serious human infection in a large proportion of encounters. between these two extremes are bacteria that can coexist with humans in a carriage state but, under appropriate circumstances, cause disease. the streptococci exemplify this group of organisms, and by studying them we can begin to address why bacteria cause such a wide spectrum of disease.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in infants: the epidemiology, clinical features, and prognostic factors.
AB  == this 16-year (1986-2001) retrospective study enrolled 80 infantile patients (aged, 30-365 days old) with culture-proven bacterial meningitis. the most prevalent pathogens were salmonellaspecies, streptococcus (s.) agalactiae, escherichia (e.) coli, and haemophilus (h.) influenzae, accounting for about 59%  of the episodes. meningitis caused by salmonella species, e. coli and h. influenzae occurs more often in the older infants, while that caused by s. agalactiae occurs more often in young infants. our study revealed a decrease in the proportion of salmonella meningitis from 27% in the first 8 years to 9% in the second 8 years with e. coli replacing salmonella species as the leading pathogen of this disease during the second period. overall mortality rate for both periods of time was 11%. however, if we take those with undesirable poor outcomes into account, 43% of patients could be considered treatment failures. the study also reveals a high prevalence of neurological complications when this  disease is caused by h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and salmonella species. stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that only initial changing levels  of consciousness (p = 0.006) were independently associated with treatment failure. the most frequent neurological complications associated with this disease included subdural empyema, hydrocephalus, cerebral infarctions, and seizures. because therapeutic regimens may require attention to the eradication of bacterial pathogen but also the neurological complications, early diagnosis and choice of appropriate antibiotics are essential to increasing the possibility of survival.

TI  == the group b streptococcal beta and pneumococcal hic proteins are structurally related immune evasion molecules that bind the complement inhibitor factor h in an analogous fashion.
AB  == complement evasion by different mechanisms is important for microbial virulence and survival in the host. one strategy used by pathogenic bacteria is to bind the soluble complement inhibitor factor h (fh) to their surfaces. in group b streptococci and pneumococci, fh binding has been shown to be mediated by the surface proteins beta and hic, respectively. we showed previously that hic binds  to the middle region of fh and protects the pneumococcus from opsonophagocytosis. as the beta protein and hic are structurally closely related, we wanted to compare the fh binding characteristics of these two proteins. by using direct binding assays with radiolabeled proteins and surface plasmon resonance analysis  we show that both beta and hic bind to the short consensus repeats 8-11 and 12-14 in the middle region of fh. peptide mapping analysis suggested that the fh-binding sites on beta and hic were composed of discontinuous and partially homologous sequences. thus, the bacterial virulence proteins use multiple binding sites on fh to secure high avidity. also, the functionally active sites on fh are thereby left free to inhibit c3b deposition and opsonophagocytosis. these results reveal the evolutionary conservation of an analogous immune evasion strategy in different types of pathogenic streptococci. importantly, the respective virulence factors could be exploited in the development of protein-based vaccines against these pathogens.

TI  == comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme m and  p.
AB  == lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme m and p, but only the m enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. disruption of the lysozyme m locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a gram-negative bacterium. unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme m-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. muramidase activity in lysozyme m-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme p mrna and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. the muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme p was less than that of recombinant m lysozyme. recombinant p lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme m to achieve the same level of killing. the lower antimicrobial activity of p lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by p lysozyme in lysozyme m-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. recombinant lysozyme m and p were equally effective in killing selected gram-positive organisms. this outcome suggests that disruption of both m and p loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by gram-positive organisms.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

AB  == we report several new findings about the function of the essential vicrk two-component regulatory system (tcs) in the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. the vicr-encoded response regulator, vick-encoded histidine kinase and the protein encoded by the downstream vicx gene are the homologues of the yycf, yycg and yycj proteins, respectively, studied previously in bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. using a regulatable promoter, we demonstrated that the vick histidine kinase is conditionally required for growth of s. pneumoniae. likewise, we found that the vicx protein is also conditionally required for growth and probably plays a role in the essential signal transduction pathway mediated by vicr and vick. recovery of limited substitutions in the conserved aspartate 52 residue (d52) of vicr was consistent with a requirement for phosphorylation of vicr for growth under some conditions. we applied microarrays to characterize the changes in transcription patterns in bacteria depleted for vicrkx operon expression. our results suggest that the pcsb gene is a target of the vicrk tcs. we present evidence that downregulation of pcsb could account for many of the defects in cell growth, shape, size and morphology observed in bacteria depleted for vicrkx expression. furthermore, constitutive expression of pcsb+ suppressed the essential requirement for the vicrk tcs and allowed the isolation of vicr null mutants.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

AB  == in order to characterize the conformational epitope of the group b meningococcal  polysaccharide and of the type iii group b streptococcus capsular polysaccharide  nmr measurements were done on a wide variety of native and modified polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. since these saccharides are highly mobile and exist as random coils in solution, the analysis of the nmr data and molecular modeling was done to take into account this inherent flexibility. the conformational model of extended high-order helices being selected upon binding to a protein, although still hypothetical at this stage, has proven useful in explaining the serology for the conformational epitopes for polysaccharides of group b neisseria meningitidis, group b streptococcus type iii and streptococcus  pneumoniae type 14.

TI  == bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  == studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (ps) antigen, interactions with t- and b-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. meningococcal, pneumococcal and salmonella vi pss and haemophilus type b ps-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided  effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. capsular pss are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. many pss are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. most pneumococcal pss are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as d-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular pss. in infants the antibody responses to most capsular pss are generally poor. enhanced immunogenicity of ps antigens can be achieved through ps-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.

AB  == we examined antibacterial activities of 4 kinds of macrolides, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), azithromycin (azm) and rokitamycin (rkm), against 6 bacterial species of clinical strains isoleted in 2002. bacterial isolates used were each 50 strains of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and 43 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae. s. agalactiae were derived from gynecological samples, and other species were isolated from respiratory specimens. antimicrobial activities against s. aureus,  s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae of 14-membered macrolides, such as em and cam, were higher than those of 16-membered macrolide,  rkm. by contrast, against s. pneumoniae, rkm was more effective than 14-membered  macrolides. six, three and four strains of s. aureus, s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae, respectively, were resistant to macrolides. thirty-five among 43 pneumococcal isolates were resistant, and 15 of the 35 were highly-resistant, mic of > 128 micrograms/ml, to any one of em, cam or azm. isolation frequency of resistant strains to rkm was lower than those to 14- and 15-membered macrolides:  only one strain was highly-resistant and 12 were intermediately-resistant. no resistant strain was recognized in m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae. further, we  analyzed the resistant mechanisms, methylation or efflux, of macrolide resistant  strains by the double-disk method. methylation was major mechanism in s. aureus,  and in s. pyogenes, all of the resistance was caused by methylation. in s. agalactiae and s. pneumoniae, methylation and efflux shared about half and half.

TI  == complement resistance mechanisms of streptococci.
AB  == group a streptococcus (gas, streptococcus pyogenes), group b streptococcus (gbs,  streptococcus agalactiae) and pneumococcus (streptococcus pneumoniae) are all human pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. these related species cause different spectra of infections spanning from trivial upper respiratory tract or skin infections to septic and severe diseases. in order to cause deep infections and survive in the human body the bacteria must evade the immune system. complement is an important part of innate immunity both as an opsonizing and membrane destructing cascade and as an effector system of antibodies. in this review, we describe the complement resistance mechanisms of the three clinically most important streptococcal species, groups a and b streptococci and pneumococcus. the complement evasion mechanisms of these three species are analogous, yet different from one another. several strains of all three species express molecules (m-proteins, bac or beta, pspc) that acquire host fluid-phase complement regulators factor h or c4b binding protein to their surfaces. groups a and b streptococci also secrete proteins and/or enzymes that inhibit the activation of the complement system or chemotaxis caused by the complement activation products. even though a lot is known about the immune evasion by streptococci, the high morbidity and mortality associated with infections caused by streptococci and the need for efficient vaccines warrant further studies on the streptococcal molecules mediating complement resistance.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == bacterial meningitis causes two distinct forms of cellular damage in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in infant rats.
AB  == bacterial meningitis causes neurological sequelae in up to 50% of survivors. two  pathogens known for their propensity to cause severe neurological damage are streptococcus pneumoniae and group b streptococci. some forms of neuronal sequelae, such as learning and memory deficits, have been associated with neuronal injury in the hippocampus. to learn more about hippocampal injury in meningitis, we performed a comparative study in bacterial meningitis due to s. pneumoniae and group b streptococcus, in which 11-day-old infant rats were infected intracisternally with either of the two pathogens. histopathological examination of the neuronal injury in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus showed that s. pneumoniae caused predominantly classical apoptotic cell death. cells undergoing apoptosis were located only in the subgranular zone and stained positive for activated caspase-3 and tunel. furthermore, dividing progenitor cells seemed particularly sensitive to this form of cell death. group b streptococcus was mainly responsible for a caspase-3-independent (and tunel-negative) form of cell death. compared with the morphological features found in apoptosis (e.g., apoptotic bodies), this form of neuronal death was characterized by clusters of uniformly shrunken cells. it affected the dentate gyrus throughout the blade, showing no preferences for immature or mature neurons. thus, depending on the infecting agent, bacterial meningitis causes two  distinct forms of cell injury in the dentate gyrus.

TI  == genome-based identification of a carbohydrate binding module in streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase.
AB  == hyaluronate lyase enzymes degrade hyaluronan, the main polysaccharide component of the connective tissues of higher animals, thereby destroying the normal connective tissue structure and exposing the host tissue cells to various endo- and exogenous factors, including bacterial toxins. the 3d crystal structures of functionally active but truncated streptococcus pneumoniae and s. agalactiae hyaluronate lyases, along with their substrate and product complexes, have been determined. the enzymes are multidomain proteins with helical barrel-like catalytic domains and two types of beta-sheet domains. here, through genome-based bioinformatics studies we identify an additional beta-sheet domain present in the most n-terminal part of streptococcal hyaluronate lyases. fold recognition and modeling studies show that the domain is structurally similar to carbohydrate binding modules and is therefore likely to be directly involved in hyaluronan binding. likely carbohydrate binding residues were identified and electrostatic complementarity of the hyaluronate lyase domain with hyaluronan demonstrated. the newly identified presumed hyaluronan binding domain likely improves catalytic efficiency by colocalizing the enzyme and its substrate. other possible functions are discussed. two contacting aromatic residues are conserved in the hydrophobic  core of the hyaluronate lyase domain and in many, perhaps all, families in the superfamily in which they may be placed. this observation may help the identification and classification of other carbohydrate binding modules.

TI  == prevalence of cefotaxime resistance in group b streptococcus isolates from osaka, japan.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus; gbs) organisms are a major cause of severe infections, including bacteremia and meningitis in newborns. according  to previous reports, gbs organisms are uniformly sensitive to penicillin g (pcg). the susceptibility of 117 strains isolated at yodogawa christian hospital in osaka, japan, in 2001 was examined with the walkaway system, using currently valid national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) interpretive criteria. twenty-one strains (18%) had intermediate susceptibility and 1 strain (1%) was resistant to pcg. fifty-one strains (44%) had intermediate susceptibility to ampicillin (abpc). no abpc-resistant strain was found. six gbs  strains were selected from the 51 strains showing intermediate susceptibility to  abpc to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). the mics of the 6 strains were: 1 microgram/ml to abpc, 0.25 microgram/ml to pcg, 2 micrograms/ml to cefotaxime (ctx), 0.016 microgram/ml to panipenem (papm), and more than 4 micrograms/ml to erythromycin (em). these 6 strains were distinctly resistant to  ctx. peak concentrations in excess of three to ten times the bactericidal concentrations at the site of infection are associated with the best clinical response. in meningitis caused by gbs whose susceptibility is intermediate or resistant to pcg or abpc, it is difficult to maintain a sufficient therapeutic concentration in cerebrospinal fluid after the administration of these two agents. it is preferable to use papm, because the efficacy and safety of papm in  the treatment of purulent meningitis caused by penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae were established in japan.

TI  == cellular activation, phagocytosis, and bactericidal activity against group b streptococcus involve parallel myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent and independent signaling pathways.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) vigorously activate inflammatory responses. we reported previously that a secreted gbs "factor" activates phagocytes via toll-like receptor (tlr)2 and tlr6, but that gbs cell walls activate cells independently of these receptors. we hypothesized that the phagocytic immune functions in response to gbs, such as inflammation, uptake, and elimination of bacteria, occur through a coordinated engagement of tlrs, along with the coreceptors cd14 and cd11b/cd18. using various knockout mice we show that gbs-induced activation of p38 and nf-kappab depends upon the expression of the cytoplasmic tlr adapter protein, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (myd88), but not tlr2 and/or tlr4. macrophages with deletions of cd14 and complement receptor  3 had a normal cytokine response to whole bacteria, although the response to gbs  factor was abrogated in cd14-null cells. the intracellular formation of bactericidal oxygen species proved to be myd88 dependent; however, uptake of gbs, a prerequisite for intracellular killing by o(2) radicals, occurred independently of myd88. while deletion of complement receptor 3 greatly diminished the uptake of opsonized gbs, it did not affect the formation of bactericidal o(2) radicals or inflammatory signaling intermediates. we conclude that the inflammatory, bactericidal, and phagocytic responses to gbs occur via parallel but independent  processes.

TI  == structure and flexibility of streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase complex with its substrate. insights into the mechanism of processive degradation of hyaluronan.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase degrades primarily hyaluronan, the main polysaccharide component of the host connective tissues, into unsaturated disaccharide units as the end product. such function of the enzyme destroys the normal connective tissue structure of the host and exposes the tissue cells to various bacterial toxins. the crystal structure of hexasaccharide hyaluronan complex with the s. agalactiae hyaluronate lyase was determined at 2.2 a resolution; the mechanism of the catalytic process, including the identification  of specific residues involved in the degradation of hyaluronan, was clearly identified. the enzyme is composed structurally and functionally from two distinct domains, an alpha-helical alpha-domain and a beta-sheet beta-domain. the flexibility of the protein was investigated by comparing the crystal structures of the s. agalactiae and the streptococcus pneumoniae enzymes, and by using essential dynamics analyses of concoord computer simulations. these revealed important modes of flexibility, which could be related to the protein function. first, a rotation/twist of the alpha-domain relative to the beta-domain is potentially related to the mechanism of processivity of the enzyme; this twist motion likely facilitates shifting of the ligand along the catalytic site cleft in order to reposition it to be ready for further cleavage. second, a movement of the alpha- and beta-domains with respect to each other was found to contribute to a change in electrostatic characteristics of the enzyme and appears to facilitate binding of the negatively charged hyaluronan ligand. third, an opening/closing of the substrate binding cleft brings a catalytic histidine closer to the cleavable  substrate beta1,4-glycosidic bond. this opening/closing mode also reflects the main conformational difference between the crystal structures of the s. agalactiae and the s. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyases.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
AB  == susceptibility patterns of 15 antimicrobial agents were assessed for 3,400 isolates of beta-hemolytic (betahs) and viridans group (vgs) streptococci in the  four regions of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program: asia-pacific (apac), europe (eu), latin america (la) and north america (na). in 1997 through 2000, sentry program monitors tested strains by reference broth microdilution methods and results were interpreted using national committee for clinical laboratory standards criteria. among the betahs processed, 81.9% of strains were  either streptococcus pyogenes (n = 650) or s. agalactiae (n = 1,190). the vgs were generally classified as unspeciated alpha-hemolytic streptococci (n = 512; 44%) or s. mitis (n = 254; 22%). seven quinolones, two beta-lactams, erythromycin (er), clindamycin (cm), quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d), vancomycin (va), teicoplanin (tp) and linezolid (lz) were tested. rank order of susceptibility for betahs isolates was: ceftriaxone (ctx) = q/d = va = tp = lz (100.0%) > gatifloxacin (gati) = trovafloxacin (trov, 99.8%) > levofloxacin (levo; 99.7%) >  penicillin (pen; 99.3%) > grepafloxacin (grepa; 97.4%) > cm (94.4%) > er (85.5%). er versus betahs had the highest mic(90) values (2 microg/ml) and the lowest susceptibility rates across all regions (range, 81.4% in na to 97.3% in la). among the vgs, susceptibility rank order was: va = tp = lz (100.0%) > q/d (99.1%) > gati = levo = trova (98.0%) > grepa (96.5%) > ctx (92.8%) > cm (90.3%) > pen (68.6%) > er (64.5%). macrolide resistance in both streptococcal species groups of the m-phenotype was highest in the americas, with erm-patterns predominating in eu and apac regions. bms284756 among the monitored new agents showed a four- to eight-fold greater potency versus these streptococcal isolates when compared to the other six tested quinolones. like streptococcus pneumoniae, these other streptococci appear to have acquired numerous resistances and require continued surveillance to direct adequate therapies.

TI  == evaluation of the vitek 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the new vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n = 100), enterococcus spp. (n = 89), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the id-gpc identification card and with the ast-p515 (for staphylococci), ast-p516 (for enterococci and s. agalactiae) and ast-p506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. the identification comparison methods were the api staph for staphylococci and the api 20 strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was used. the vitek 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of s. aureus, 96.5% of s. agalactiae, 96.9% of s. pneumoniae, 92.7% of enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). more than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. according to the nccls breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for s. aureus, from 90 to 100% for cns, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for s. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for s. pneumoniae. microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were cns-erythromycin, cns-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. major errors were observed for cns-oxacillin and s. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the vitek 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == genetic bases and medical relevance of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in pathogenic streptococci.
AB  == many streptococci are human and/or animal pathogens and the frequent cause of life-threatening diseases. among various streptococcal virulence factors, capsular polysaccharides (cps) are recognized as essential to prevent phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. in the last decade, an impressive advance on the knowledge of the genetic bases underlying capsule formation has been achieved. the capsular gene cluster driving the formation of the cp of streptococcus pyogenes and other hyaluronate-producing streptococci, represents one of the simplest cases of gene organization to synthesize a capsule. a more complex situation has been found in streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus suis, and other streptococci. on the whole, there exists a direct relationship between the structural and chemical complexity of the repeating unit of the polysaccharide and the number of genes found in the corresponding capsular locus. streptococcal vaccines, either polysaccharide or conjugate, are currently being tested in clinical trials to overcome the rise of  worldwide antibiotic resistance, although, for different reasons, none of these vaccines are expected to provide the required full coverage in a near future. this concern has prompted to explore alternative possibilities with an improved therapeutic potential against streptococcal diseases.

TI  == type iii group b streptococcal polysaccharide induces antibodies that cross-react with streptococcus pneumoniae type 14.
AB  == covalent linkage of a bacterial polysaccharide to a protein greatly enhances the  carbohydrate's immunogenicity and its binding to solid surfaces in immunoassays.  these findings have spurred the development of glycoconjugate vaccines to prevent serious bacterial infections as well as the use of glycoconjugates as coating antigens in bioassays. we evaluated sera from women immunized with unconjugated group b streptococcal (gbs) type iii (gbs iii) polysaccharide (iiips) or with iiips covalently linked to tetanus toxoid to assess specificity, sensitivity, and parallelism in dilution curves in two gbs iii enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  (elisas). one assay used iiips mixed with methylated human serum albumin (iiips + mhsa) as the coating antigen, and the other used iiips covalently linked to hsa (iii-hsa). each coating antigen was associated with a highly specific gbs iii bioassay. the sensitivity was higher in the iii-hsa elisa, in which conjugated iiips is bound to the plates. parallelism in titration curves was observed in the iii-hsa but not in the iiips + mhsa elisa. the excellent correlation between the  concentrations of gbs iiips-specific immunoglobulin g (igg) and the opsonophagocytic activity of these antibodies indicated that the iii-hsa assay can predict functionality of vaccine-induced igg against gbs iii disease. the structure of the repeating unit of the capsular polysaccharide of gbs iii differs from that of streptococcus pneumoniae type 14 (pn14 ps) only by the presence on gbs iii of a sialic acid residue at the end of the side chain. the majority of healthy adults responding to gbs iii vaccines with a fourfold or greater increase in gbs iii-specific igg antibodies developed antibodies cross-reacting with pn14  ps (i.e., desialylated gbs iiips). the proportion of gbs vaccine responders who developed igg to the desialylated iiips did not depend on whether iiips was given in the unconjugated or conjugated form. when present, these vaccine-induced cross-reacting antibodies conferred in vitro antibody-mediated opsonophagocytosis and killing of both gbs iii and pn14, two pathogens that cause invasive disease in young infants.

TI  == bacterial meningitis: current controversies in approaches to treatment.
AB  == acute bacterial meningitis continues to be a disease with unacceptably high mortality and morbidity rates in both adults and children worldwide, despite advances in antibacterial therapy. death or permanent disability occurs frequently. the causative organism varies with age, immune function and immunisation status. infection with neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) is associated with the majority of cases, with listeria monocytogenes and streptococcus agalactiae being more prevalent pathogens at the extremes of age (<3 months or >50 years). antibacterial resistance is an increasing problem, particularly in pneumococcal bacteria but increasingly in other organisms. the increasing prevalence of resistance of pneumococcus to penicillin and the cephalosporins complicates therapy and may have an important impact on treatment outcome. increased understanding of the pathophysiology has allowed advances in diagnosis and therapy. the use of adjunctive corticosteroids remains controversial, but is probably beneficial in reducing neurological sequelae in children. in adults the  evidence is less clear. vaccination has virtually eradicated hib meningitis in some countries. recent introduction of a conjugate vaccine against serogroup c meningococci in the uk has caused a dramatic reduction in the incidence of invasive disease due to this organism. a 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine promises a similar reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease. in the meantime, the emergence of widespread resistance of organisms to antibacterial agents, in particular among the common organisms causing bacterial meningitis, remains the biggest challenge in therapy.

TI  == susceptibility of a variety of clinical isolates to linezolid: a european inter-country comparison.
AB  == using standardized in vitro susceptibility tests, 3382 bacteria recently isolated from skin, blood or respiratory tract infections were analysed for their susceptibility to linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, and a number of comparator antibacterial agents. isolates originated in france, italy, germany, spain, sweden, the netherlands and the uk. laboratories in each country independently conducted broth microdilution susceptibility tests using nccls methods and epsilonometry (etest). isolates of gram-positive cocci tested in each laboratory  included methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus  pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. isolates of moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were also included. where appropriate, comparator drugs (oxacillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, co-amoxiclav, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, penicillin g, clindamycin and ampicillin) were also tested. linezolid demonstrated excellent activity against all of the gram-positive cocci with mic50s ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/l. the drug demonstrated only modest activity against m. catarrhalis and h. influenzae with mic50s ranging from 4 to 16 mg/l.

TI  == identification of enterococcus, streptococcus, and staphylococcus by multivariate analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data from plate cultures.
AB  == a new fingerprinting technique with the potential for rapid identification of bacteria was developed by combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)h  mrs) with multivariate statistical analysis. this resulted in an objective identification strategy for common clinical isolates belonging to the bacterial species staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and the streptococcus milleri group. duplicate cultures of 104 different isolates were examined one or more times using (1)h mrs. a total of 312 cultures were examined. an optimized classifier was developed using a bootstrapping process and a seven-group linear discriminant analysis to provide objective classification of the spectra. identification of isolates was based on consistent high-probability  classification of spectra from duplicate cultures and achieved 92% agreement with conventional methods of identification. fewer than 1% of isolates were identified incorrectly. identification of the remaining 7% of isolates was defined as indeterminate.

TI  == serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility of group b streptococcus over an eight-year period in southern taiwan.
AB  == the increase in penicillin resistance among pneumococci and viridans streptococci and the development of serotype-specific conjugate vaccine have increased the need for knowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibility and the capsular serotypes of group b streptococci. over an 8-year period, 351 group b streptococcal isolates from southern taiwan were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and serotype determination. eighty-seven percent of the isolates were typeable. types iii (28.5%) and v (27.1%) were the most common serotypes. the occurrence of type  v isolates increased with age, while that of type iii isolates decreased with age, showing a predominance in children less than 1 year of age. of 118 isolates  from cases of invasive infection, types ia, ib, ii, iii, iv, and v accounted for  12.7, 11.9, 0.8, 33, 1.7, and 26.3%, respectively. using the agar dilution method, all isolates were found to be susceptible to penicillin, cefotaxime, and  vancomycin, 99.4% to ofloxacin, 78.1% to chloramphenicol, 63.2% to azithromycin,  62.6% to erythromycin, 57.3% to clindamycin, and 2.8% to tetracycline. chloramphenicol resistance was associated with type iii isolates (59 of 100, 59%) and erythromycin and azithromycin resistance with type ib isolates (25 of 33 176%], and 21 of 33 [64%], respectively). thus, 72% of the isolates from invasive infections were serotype iii, v, or ia, and penicillin remains the drug of choice for treatment or prophylaxis of group b streptococcal infections in southern taiwan, despite the high prevalence of penicillin resistance among streptococcus  pneumoniae and viridans streptococci.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [prevention of perinatal infection caused by group b beta-hemolytic streptococcus].
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae strains or group b streptococci (gbs) are the leading cause of bacterial pneumoniae, sepsis and meningitis in neonates. gbs is also a major cause of bacteriemia in pregnant women. colonization of the human rectovaginal tract with gbs is a risk factor associated with chorioamnionitis and transmission of the infection to the infant. neonatal exposure to high concentrations of gbs, mainly during vaginal delivery, leads to colonisation of the lung airways and subsequent onset of severe diseases like pneumonia, sepsis and menigitis. gbs is present in the genitourinary tract of 10% to 40% of pregnant women, about 50% of the newborns of these mothers will be colonised during delivery and of these neonates, 1% to 2% present a severe invasive disease. the early-onset disease, appear in the neonates within 7 days of life and more than 90% occur within the first day of life. fatal infection is associated commonly with fulminat and overwhelming early-onset disease. maternal-intrapartum chemoprophylaxis is able to prevent the transmission of gbs  to the newborn and to reduce the frequency and the severity of early onset disease. in many countries, in particular in us, several recommendations have been proposed to prevent the perinatal gbs infection. in this paper some recommendations to prevent gbs disease of the newborn, performed in collaboration with italian society of perinatal medicine, are presented. the most important problem in the prevention programme is the identification of the cases to treat,  since it is not possible to give antibiotics to all the women. we combine two strategies for the identification of the women to be treated, one risk based and  the other screening based. intra-partum administration of ampicillin or penicillin is recommended for the women with one or more risk-factors (labour < 37 weeks of gestation, duration of ruptured membranes > = 18 hours, intrapartum temperature > = 38 degrees c, previous infant with invasive gbs disease, diabetes) and for women with collect vaginal and rectal swab for gbs culture at 36-38 weeks' gestation, positive for gbs. no treatment is required for the babies of women intrapartum treated or with negative culture performed near term. treatment with ampicillin is necessary, only in the new-borns of women with incomplete or unknown results or not done cultures and in those born from mothers with positive cultures, but not intrapartum treated. collection of swabs for gbs  is recommended before antibiotic administration. if the culture is negative, we suggest to stop the antibiotic therapy, otherwise the treatment must be continuated for 5-7 days. in conclusion, a written protocol for prevention of gbs infection in new-born must be adopted in every delivery centre and one possible protocol is proposed in this paper.

TI  == nationwide german multicenter study on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in streptococcal blood isolates from neutropenic patients and comparative in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobials.
AB  == in a prospective multicenter study (1996 to 1999), 156 episodes of bacteremic streptococcal infections of neutropenic patients were evaluated. streptococcus oralis (26.3%), s. pneumoniae (26.3%), s. agalactiae (11.5%), s. mitis (9%), and  s. pyogenes (5.8%) were the predominant species. four strains (2.6%) were found to be intermediately resistant to penicillin. one strain (0.6%) was found to be highly resistant to penicillin (mic, 8 mg/liter). reduced susceptibility to penicillin was detected among s. oralis (14.6%), s. mitis (7.1%), and s. pneumoniae (4.9%) isolates but was not recorded among s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes. resistance rates and intermediate resistance rates for other antimicrobials were as follows (all species): amoxicillin, 1.3 and 3.2%; erythromycin, 16 and 2.6%; clindamycin, 5.8 and 0%; ciprofloxacin, 1.9 and 7.7%.  quinupristin-dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against most streptococcal isolates (mic at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited [mic(50)], 0.5 mg/liter; mic(90), 1 mg/liter, mic range, 0.25 to 4 mg/liter).

TI  == mutually exclusive distribution of is1548 and gbsi1, an active group ii intron identified in human isolates of group b streptococci.
AB  == the present study shows that active, self-splicing group ii intron gbsi1 is located downstream of the c5a-peptidase gene, scpb, in some group b streptococcus (gbs) isolates that lack insertion sequence is1548. is1548 was previously reported to be often present at the scpb locus in gbs isolated in association with endocarditis. since none of 67 gbs isolates examined, 40 of which were of serotype iii, harbored both is1548 and gbsi1, these two elements are suggested to be markers for different genetic lineages in gbs serotype iii. the dna region downstream of scpb in gbs isolates harboring either gbsi1, is1548, or none of these mobile elements was found to encode the laminin binding protein, lmb, which shows sequence similarities to a family of streptococcal adhesins. is1548 is inserted 9 bp upstream of the putative promoter for lmb, while the insertion site for gbsi1 is located 88 bp further upstream. sequences highly similar to gbsi1 exist also in streptococcus pneumoniae. an inverted repeat sequence, with features typical of transcription terminators, was identified immediately upstream of the insertion site for the group ii intron both in the gbs and s. pneumoniae sequences. this motif is suggested to constitute a target for the gbs  intron as well as for rather closely related introns in bacillus halodurans, pseudomonas alcaligenes, and pseudomonas putida. when transcripts containing the  gbsi1 intron were incubated at high concentrations of ammonium and magnesium, a major product with the expected length and sequence for the ligated exons was generated. unlike, however, all members of group ii investigated so far, the excised intron was in linear, rather than in a branched (lariat), form.

TI  == [a comparative study of antibacterial activity of ceftibuten, ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin against clinical isolates].
AB  == ceftibuten is an orally active third generation new cephalosporin. its antibacterial activity in vitro was tested to many clinical isolates and was compared to the activity of ceftazidime, cefuroxime and ampicillin, by twofold serial dilution method in muller-hinton agar--detection of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and by the disc-diffusion method of kirby-bauer. the new cephalosporin demonstrated great activity against the different clinical important strains. many resistant strains to ampicillin were high susceptible to  ceftibuten. the majority of gram-negative organisms, including enterobacteriaceae, the respiratory pathogens m.(b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae are highly susceptible to ceftibuten, however pseudomonas, acinetobacter are resistant. the majority of methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus are resistant too. new cephallosporin was also active against s. pyogenes (streptococcus gr. a) and penicillin-susceptible pneumococci, but was inactive against s. agalactiae (streptococcus gr. b), s. pneumoniae penicillin-resistant strains and enterococci, similar to the other cephalosporins. the activity of ceftibuten was higher than that of ampicillin and cefuroxime against beta-lactamases positive strains of h. influenzae and m.(b) catarrhalis, also against tested strains of enterobacteriaceae. the major priority of the new antibacterial agent over other cephalosporins and ampicillin  is its stability to hydrolysis by the main broad-spectrum beta-lactamases producing e. coli and k. pneumoniae sp.

TI  == multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  == an optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers  on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae and k. oxytoca, clostridium bifermentans and c. sordellii, and prevotella bivia. serial  electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. the method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of s. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires  experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin against 4151 gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
AB  == gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin are fluoroquinolones  with enhanced gram-positive activity while retaining broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative pathogens. levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are older quinolones with broad activity against gram-negative pathogens and borderline activity against some gram-positive organisms. we compared the in vitro activity  of these compounds against 4151 gram-negative and -positive organisms. gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin were highly active against penicillin sensitive and resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were active but less potent. all compounds were highly active (overall) against gram-negative pathogens with ciprofloxacin being  the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa. our data indicate that the  advanced fluoroquinolones will be important compounds for treating infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == the extracellular hyaluronidase gene (hyla) of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == group a streptococci produce an extracellular hyaluronidase (hyaluronate lyase) which may be associated with the spread of the organism during infection. the gene for this hyaluronidase (hyla) encodes an 868 amino acid protein with a molecular size of 99636 da. cleavage of the proposed signal peptide results in an extracellular protein of 95941 da. comparison with other bacterial hyaluronidases indicates strong similarities to the genes from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus. a region internal to the hyla gene was amplified from all 175 strains of streptococcus pyogenes tested suggesting a widespread distribution of the gene.

TI  == pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  == from 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in taichung veterans general hospital. their age range was 25 to 85 years. diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. the duration of symptoms prior  to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (ct) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded  as primary. staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, s. epidermidis, and salmonella spp.. in the secondary abscess category, e. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and candida albicans. the associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal  abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. the  initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess.  one patient had both drainage and debridement. others received medical treatment  only. two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is  still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.

TI  == analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the insertion sequence is1381 in group b streptococci.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are typed by capsular polysaccharide type. is1381, an  insertion sequence previously described in streptococcus pneumoniae, was cloned from gbs strain a909. the presence of multiple copies of is1381 in a909 suggested that is1381 analysis might be an effective subtyping tool. is1381 was found by southern blot analysis to be present in 18 (72%) of 25 of unrelated gbs isolates  tested. is1381 analysis allowed discrimination between strains that contain is1381 with a discriminatory power >99%. eight of 8 sets of epidemiologically related isolates containing is1381 give identical or nearly identical patterns of is1381 insertion. for 2 maternal/infant sets, a single additional insertion was seen in 1 strain, suggesting that an additional insertion occurred between maternal colonization and infection of the infant. insertion patterns of is1381 are an effective tool for subtyping gbs.

TI  == [meningitis (ii)--acute bacterial meningitis].
AB  == acute meningitis is a medical emergency, particularly in patients with rapidly progressing disease, mental status changes or neurological deficits. the majority of cases of bacterial meningitis are caused by a limited number of species, i.e.  streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitis, listeria monocytogenes, group b streptococci (streptococcus agalactiae), haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae. many other pathogens can occasionally cause bacterial meningitis, often under special clinical circumstances. treatment of meningitis includes two main goals: eradication of the infecting organism, and management of cns and systemic complications. empiric therapy should be initiated without delay, as the prognosis of the disease depends on the time when therapy is started. one or two blood cultures should be obtained before administering the first antibiotic. empiric therapy is primarily based on the age of the patient, with modifications if there are positive findings on csf gram stain or if the patient presents with special risk factors. it is safer to choose regimens with broad coverage, as they can usually be modified within 24-48 hours, when antibiotic sensitivities of the infecting organism become available. adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone is also administered in severely ill patients concomitantly with the first antibiotic dose. in patients who are clinically stable and are unlikely to be adversely affected if antibiotics are not administered immediately, including those with suspected viral or chronic meningitis, a lumbar puncture represents the first step, unless there is clinical suspicion of an intracerebral mass lesion. findings in the csf and on ct scan, if performed, will guide the further diagnostic work-up and therapy in all patients.

TI  == in vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, and listeria). ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to  penicillin (s. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, and in listeria monocytogenes isolates. moreover, 1 of 22 s. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 e. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. resistances to levofloxacin with mic90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and e. faecalis isolates. in any case, the mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. in time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an e. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide gram-positive spectrum.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. we compared the  in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. the susceptibility of 37 staphylococcus aureus (14 ms, 23 mr), 26 staphylococcus epidermidis (16 ms, 10 mr), 20 streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 group  a streptococcus pyogenes, 15 streptococcus agalactiae, 10 enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 enterococcus faecium (9 van a) was evaluated. quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all gram-positive species tested, including met-r s. aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l), met-r s. epidermidis (mic < or = 2 mg/l), s. pneumoniae (mic < or = 1 mg/l), ery-r and ery-s streptococci (mic < or  = 1 mg/l). the strains of e. faecalis were generally less susceptible. time-kill  studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x mic concentration showed  a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x mic concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. a prolonged pae was obtained for s. pneumoniae (8 h), s. pyogenes (9 h) and s. agalactiae (7  h), while the shortest pae was seen for e. faecalis and e. faecium (about 4 h).

TI  == etiology of pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis in infants younger than three months of age in ethiopia.
AB  == methods: within a multicenter study coordinated by who, an investigation of the etiologic agents of pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis was performed among infants  younger than 3 months of age seen at the ethio-swedish children's hospital in addis ababa for a period of 2 years. of the 816 infants enrolled 405 had clinical indications for investigation. results: there were a total of 41 isolates from blood cultures from 40 infants. the study showed that the traditionally known acute respiratory infection pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae was most common in  this extended neonatal age group, found in 10 of 41 blood isolates. streptococcus pyogenes was a common pathogen in this setting (9 of 41 blood isolates), whereas  salmonella group b was found in 5 of 41 isolates. streptococcus agalactiae, which is a common pathogen in developed countries, was absent. a study of the susceptibility pattern of these organisms suggests that a combination of ampicillin with an aminoglycoside is adequate for initial treatment of these serious bacterial infections, but the combination is not optimal for the treatment of salmonella infections. among 202 infants on whom immunofluorescent antibody studies for viruses were performed based on nasopharyngeal aspirates, respiratory syncytial virus was found in 57 (28%) infants, and chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 32 (15.8%) of 203 infants.

TI  == etiology of serious infections in young gambian infants.
AB  == background: despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including the gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. the study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in gambian infants younger than 91 days old. methods: at a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or  cerebrospinal fluid. at a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. results: there were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae (7), streptococcus pyogenes (2), enterobacter cloacae (2), escherichia coli (1), haemophilus influenzae type b (1), streptococcus agalactiae (1) and salmonella spp. (1). six of these children died. thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for staphylococcus aureus (17), s. pneumoniae (3), salmonella spp. (5), e. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and s. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were  investigated for common respiratory viruses. respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza a in 46, influenza b in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. respiratory syncytial virus and influenza a isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. nasopharyngeal carriage of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. of these 184 (58%) were positive for s. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for h. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die,  whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. conclusions: the most important causes of serious infections in young gambian infants are staphylococcus aureus, s. pneumoniae and salmonella spp.

TI  == v2 regions of 16s ribosomal rna used as a molecular marker for the species identification of streptococci in peripheral blood and synovial fluid from patients with psoriatic arthritis.
AB  == objective: to detect the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) of 3 streptococcal species in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with psoriatic arthritis (psa). methods: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) detection targets bacterial 16s rrna, which is present in bacteria at high copy numbers. the 3 species-specific primers for group a streptococci (gas; streptococcus pyogenes), group b streptococci (gbs; streptococcus agalactiae), and streptococcus pneumoniae were designed from the fragments of highly variable  v2 regions of 16s rrna. total rna was prepared from whole peripheral blood and joint fluid obtained from patients with psa and rheumatoid arthritis (ra). all positive pcr reactions were then sequenced with a pharmacia alf dna sequencing system. results: our data in 19 psa patients showed that 7 peripheral blood samples were positive for gas (p = 0.006 versus gas-positive ra patients [n = 0], by fisher's exact test), and 2 were also positive for gbs. one synovial fluid sample from a psa patient was positive for gas. s pneumoniae was absent from all  specimens. seventeen patients with ra were pcr negative for the 3 streptococcal species. peripheral blood from a patient with inflammatory bowel disease was positive for gas. conclusion: the presence of gas 16s rrna in the peripheral blood and synovial fluid of patients with psa supports the concept that psa is a  reactive arthritis to certain streptococci.

TI  == ozonolytic depolymerization of polysaccharides in aqueous solution.
AB  == the selective oxidation of beta-d-glycosidic linkages of polysaccharides by ozone has great utility as a general method for depolymerization of polysaccharides. here we describe a 'one-step' method whereby polysaccharides dissolved in water or basic solutions are depolymerized by ozonolysis. the oxidation of glycosidic linkages of unprotected carbohydrates by ozone is complicated by several side reactions. we describe here optimized conditions for carrying out ozonolysis degradation. we also characterize the major pathways for unwanted degradation by  various side reactions. in the preferred oxidation pathway, the aldosidic linkage is oxidized to an aldonic ester function that hydrolyzes under the basic conditions employed to give a free aldonate, with cleavage of the polysaccharide  chain. nonselective degradation pathways include oxidative degradation by radical species that oxidize glycosyl residues to formic, acetic, and oxalic acids. the nonselective degradation caused by acids is minimized by basic buffers. the products of polysaccharide depolymerization form a size distribution around a nominal molecular weight, and the average molecular weight of the products can be controlled by the rate or amount of ozone passed through the reaction mixture. the ozonolysis method described herein provides a convenient, inexpensive, and controllable means for generating small polysaccharides or large oligosaccharide  fragments.

AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == molecular characterization of type-specific capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis  genes of streptococcus agalactiae type ia.
AB  == the type-specific capsular polysaccharide (cp) of a group b streptococcus, streptococcus agalactiae type ia, is a high-molecular-weight polymer consisting of the pentasaccharide repeating unit 4)-[alpha-d-neupnac-(2-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->4)-beta-d-glcpnac-(1- ->3 )]-beta-d-galp-(1-->4)-beta-d-glcp-(1. here, cloning, sequencing, and transcription of the type ia-specific capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) genes and functional analysis of these gene products are described. a 26-kb dna fragment containing 18 complete open reading frames (orfs) was cloned. these orfs were designated cpsiaa to cpsial, neu (neuraminic acid synthesis gene) a to d, orf1 and ung (uracil dna glycosylase). the cps gene products of s. agalactiae type ia were homologous to proteins involved in cp synthesis of s. agalactiae type iii and s. pneumoniae serotype 14. unlike the cps gene cluster of s. pneumoniae serotype 14, transcription of this operon may start from cpsiaa, cpsiae, and orf1 because putative promoter sequences were found in front of these genes. northern hybridization, reverse transcription-pcr, and primer extension analyses supported this hypothesis. dna sequence analysis showed that there were  two transcriptional terminators in the 3' end of this operon (downstream of orf1  and ung). the functions of cpsiae, cpsiag, cpsiai, and cpsiaj were examined by glycosyltransferase assay by using the gene products expressed in escherichia coli jm109 harboring plasmids containing various s. agalactiae type ia cps gene fragments. enzyme assays suggested that the gene products of cpsiae, cpsiag, cpsiai, and cpsiaj are putative glucosyltransferase, beta-1, 4-galactosyltransferase, beta-1,3-n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, and beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, respectively.

TI  == standardization may suffice for licensure of conjugate vaccines.
AB  == standardization schemes devised by control agencies have followed clinical trials of experimental vaccines. the wealth of information about the pathogenesis of and immunity to bacteria, whose surface polysaccharides are protective antigens, now  permits standardization to predict the efficacy of polysaccharide-based vaccines. there has been tacit acceptance of this notion with the licensure of groups y and w135 meningococcal vaccines and of many of the pneumococcal types whose frequency in patients was too low for statistical significance to be assigned for their clinical efficacy. in fact, this was also the case for licensure of polio virus type 2 vaccine. we can reliably measure the level of anti-polysaccharide antibodies for meningococci, pneumococci, gbs and the vi of s. typhi. haemophilus type b conjugates have been reliably standardized by physico-chemical assays. new conjugates, therefore, may be licensed by data provided by standardization without awaiting the results of costly and time-consuming efficacy trials. adoption of this scientifically-based approach to licensure will hasten the implementation of new and more effective vaccines.

AB  == a drug susceptibility test of the combination drug taz/pipc, which consists of a  newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor, tazobactam (taz), and one of penicillin antibiotics, piperacillin (pipc), with combination ratio of 1:4 in potency, was conducted with stock strains and clinical isolates. the clinical efficacy and safety of its injection was also evaluated in children with a variety of infectious diseases. the results were as follows: 1. in susceptibility test, 114  strains from 4 species of stock strains were treated with 8 drugs, that is, taz/pipc, pipc, penicillin g (pcg), ampicillin (abpc), cefotiam (ctm), cefotaxime (ctx), ceftazidime (caz), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz). of three clinically isolated species from patients, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) was  treated with taz/pipc, pipc, methicillin (dmppc), ctm, ctx, and sbt/cpz, and the  others were treated with the same drugs except for dmppc. the mics were measured  for these bacterial strains inoculated at the concentration of 10(6) cfu/ml. the  mic90 values of taz/pipc against 45 strains of streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes), one of the stock cultures of gram-positive cocci, were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc, ctm, caz, and sbt/cpz. the mics of taz/pipc for 28 strains of streptococcus agalactiae (s. agalactiae) were 0.39 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc, ctm, caz, and sbt/cpz. as for gram-negative bacilli, the mic90 of taz/pipc against 10 strains of bordetella pertussis (b. pertussis) were 0.10 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc. the mic90 of taz/pipc against 31 strains of haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae) were 0.05 microgram/ml and similar to those of pipc, ctx, and sbt/cpz. regarding  gram-positive cocci isolated from patients received this combination drug, the mic90 of taz/pipc against 2 strains of s. aureus, a non beta-lactamase producing  strain and a low-beta-lactamase producing strain, were 0.78 microgram/ml and 3.1  micrograms/ml, respectively; the former value was similar to those of pipc, dmppc, ctm, and ctx, and the latter was similar to those of pipc, dmppc, ctx, and sbt/cpz. of 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains were inhibited at 0.05 microgram/ml, and the others at 1.56 micrograms/ml; both values were similar to those of pipc, sbt/cpz. as for gram-negative bacilli, 6 of 7 strains of h. influenzae did not produce beta-lactamase and 1 strain was a high producer. the mics of taz/pipc against beta-lactamase nonproducing strains were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml in 5 strains and 0.39 microgram/ml in 1 strain, and the values were  similar to those of pipc and sbt/cpz. while the mic of taz/pipc against the high  beta-lactamase producing strain was 0.78 microgram/ml; similar to that of sbt/cpz and smaller than that of pipc. 2. the results of clinical effects on 7 diseases in 33 cases were as follows: taz/pipc was clinically judged "excellent" in 17 (51.5%); good in 14 (42.4%); fair in 2 (6.1%). no case with no response was seen  in this study, and the total efficacy rate of "excellent" and "good" was 93.9%. 3. bacteriological effects were evaluated in 17 strains of 4 species, and all of  them were eradicated. 4. adverse reactions were judged in 35, which consisted of  33 in which the clinical effects were evaluated and 2 dropped from this study. of these cases, diarrhea was observed in 4 (11.4%). 5. laboratory tests revealed an  increase in platelets in 1 of 32 cases (3.1%), and eosinophilia in 2 of 29 cases  (6.9%). biochemical profile showed an increase in gpt alone and abnormal increases in both got and gpt in 1 each out of 21 cases.

TI  == group a beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections.
AB  == gabhs is the most common bacterial cause of tonsillopharyngitis, but this organism also produces acute otitis media; pneumonia; skin and soft-tissue infections; cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic infections; bacteremia; and meningitis. most children and adolescents who develop a sore throat do not have gabhs as the cause; their infection is viral in etiology. other bacterial pathogens produce sore throat infrequently (e.g., chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae), and when they do, other concomitant clinical illness is present. classic streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis has an acute onset; produces concurrent headache, stomach ache, and dysphagia; and upon  examination is characterized by intense tonsillopharyngeal erythema, yellow exudate, and tender/enlarged anterior cervical glands. unfortunately only about 20% to 30% of patients present with classic disease. physicians overdiagnose streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis by a wide margin, which almost always leads to  unnecessary treatment with antibiotics. accordingly, use of throat cultures and/or rapid gabhs detection tests in the office is strongly advocated. their use has been shown to be cost-effective and to reduce antibiotic overprescribing substantially. penicillin currently is recommended by the american academy of pediatrics and american heart association as first-line therapy for gabhs infections; erythromycin is recommended for those allergic to penicillin. virtually all patients improve clinically with penicillin and other antibiotics.  however, penicillin treatment failures do occur, especially in tonsillopharyngitis in which 5% to 35% of patients do not experience bacteriologic eradication. penicillin treatment failures are more common among patients who have been treated recently with the drug. cephalosporins or azithromycin are preferred following penicillin treatment failures in selected patients as first-line therapy, based on a history of penicillin failures or lack of compliance and for impetigo. gabhs remain exquisitely sensitive to penicillin  in vitro. there are several explanations for penicillin treatment failures, but the possibility of copathogen co-colonization in vivo has received the most attention. treatment duration with penicillin should be 10 days to optimize cure  in gabhs infections. a 5-day regimen is possible and approved by the united states food and drug administration for cefpodoxime (a cephalosporin) and azithromycin (a macrolide). prevention of rheumatic fever is the primary objective for antibiotic therapy of gabhs infections, but a reduction in contagion and faster clinical improvement also can be achieved. development of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis ("flesh-eating bacteria") are rising concerns. the portal of entry for these invasive gabhs strains is far more often skin and soft tissue than the tonsillopharynx.

TI  == acute bacterial meningitis in children admitted to the queen elizabeth central hospital, blantyre, malawi in 1996-97.
AB  == to design appropriate interventions, we collected clinical and demographic data prospectively on all children aged one day to 14 years admitted with a diagnosis  of bacterial meningitis (bm) from april 1st 1996 to march 31st 1997 to the queen  elizabeth central hospital (qech), blantyre, malawi. during the study period 267  children (2.7% of all paediatric admissions) were found to have bm; 83% were under 5 years of age, 61% under one year and 23% under one month. the most common causative organisms in the post neonatal period (n=206) were streptococcus pneumoniae (27%), haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) 21%, and salmonella typhimurium (6%). in the neonatal group (< 1 month, n=61) the most common causes  were streptococcus agalactiae (23%), s. typhimurium (15%), s. pneumoniae (11.5%)  and other gram negative rods (11.5%). nineteen of 21 salmonella infections were in children under one year of age and all s. agalactiae were in infants under three months. there was delay on presentation: the average length of fever was 4.6 days, 39.5% had convulsed prior to arrival and 57% had an altered level of consciousness. an initial diagnosis of malaria had probably contributed to the delay in 22.5% (42 of 186 tested). 48% were < 80% weight for age, with 18% < 60%) weight for age. the overall mortality was 40%. the outcome was worst in salmonella infections, particularly neonatal salmonella bm with a case fatality rate (cfr) of 89% (8 of 9 cases). coma on presentation worsened prognosis (mortality 64% if blantyre coma score < 3, 26% if > 3). 15% of survivors had sequelae on discharge. 20% of hib isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, but all salmonellae were sensitive. 5% of s. pneumoniae were resistant to penicillin  and 8% to chloramphenicol. earlier access to adequate health care and awareness of bm in a malaria-endemic area would reduce mortality and morbidity. vaccination against hib infection would have reduced death by 18 (17%) and prevented sequelae in 7 cases.

TI  == inhibition of group b streptococcal growth by ifn gamma-activated human glioblastoma cells.
AB  == group b streptococci are the most important bacteria inducing neonatal septicemia and meningitis. the aim of this study was to assess the role of ifngamma in the induction of anti-microbial effector mechanisms in human brain tumor cells. different human glioblastoma/astrocytoma cell lines, stimulated with ifngamma, restricted the growth of group b streptococci. in addition, we found that tnf alpha is able to enhance the ifngamma-mediated anti-microbial effect. in contrast to group b streptococci, other bacteria which are also capable of inducing meningitis, like e. coli and all but one of the tested streptococcus pneumoniae strains, were not influenced by the ifngamma treated cells. we found that the ifngamma or the ifngamma/tnf alpha induced activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is responsible for the inhibition of streptococcal growth, since  the addition of supplemental l-tryptophan completely blocks the ifngamma induced  bacteriostasis.

TI  == azithromycin. a review of its use in paediatric infectious diseases.
AB  == azithromycin is an azalide antimicrobial agent active in vitro against major pathogens responsible for infections of the respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues in children. pathogens that are generally susceptible to azithromycin include haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella spp., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae. azithromycin is also generally active against erythromycin- and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. azithromycin is administered once daily, achieves clinically relevant concentrations at sites of infection, is slowly eliminated from the body and has few drug interactions. in children, azithromycin is usually given as either a 3-day course of 10 mg/kg/day or a 5-day course with 10 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 5 mg/kg/day for a further 4 days. these standard regimens were as effective as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, cefaclor and amoxicillin in the treatment of children with otitis media. azithromycin was also as effective as either phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v), erythromycin, clarithromycin or cefaclor against streptococcal pharyngitis or tonsillitis in children, but appears to result in more recurrence of infection than phenoxymethylpenicillin in this indication, necessitating a dosage of 12 mg/kg/day for 5 days. community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections in children responded as well to azithromycin as to  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin or josamycin. azithromycin was similar or superior to ceftibuten in mixed general practice populations of patients. however, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections resolved more rapidly with azithromycin than with erythromycin, josamycin or cefaclor. skin and soft tissue infections responded as well to azithromycin as to cefaclor, dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin, and oral azithromycin was as effective as ocular tetracycline in treating trachoma. although not as well tolerated as phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis, azithromycin is at least as well tolerated as most other agents used to treat respiratory tract and other infections in children and was better tolerated than  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. adverse events that do occur are mostly gastrointestinal and tend to be mild to moderate in severity. conclusions: azithromycin is an effective and well tolerated alternative to first-line agents  in the treatment of respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections in children, offerring the convenience of a short, once-daily regimen.

TI  == use of the lactococcal nisa promoter to regulate gene expression in gram-positive bacteria: comparison of induction level and promoter strength.
AB  == we characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisa promoter in strains of the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis. nisa promoter activity was dependent on the proteins nisr and nisk, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the  extracellular inducer nisin. the nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. significant induction of the nisa promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is  inhibited. the efficiency of the nisa promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the spac, xyla, and laca promoters in b. subtilis and in s. pyogenes. because  nisa promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.

TI  == evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  == this report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pyogenes. the study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in q/d worldwide phase iii comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. q/d was highly active, with minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mics) < or = 1.0 microg/ml against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. q/d was active (mics < or = 1 microg/ml) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. q/d was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant s. aureus strains (mic90=1 microg/ml), as was vancomycin (mic90=2 microg/ml), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (mic90=32 vs 1 microg/ml). given its spectrum of  activity, q/d may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.

TI  == a new ketolide, hmr 3004, active against streptococci inducibly resistant to erythromycin.
AB  == hmr 3004 is a new hydrazono ketolide characterized by a 3-keto function instead of the cladinose moiety. the effect of this antimicrobial agent on inducible and  constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mlsb) resistance was tested in a lacz reporter system under control of several ermam-like attenuator variants. for one constitutively resistant streptococcus agalactiae strain, three inducibly resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, and one inducibly resistant enterococcus faecalis strain, the attenuators fused with lacz were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pjim2246 and the plasmid was introduced into staphylococcus aureus rn4220. for the wild-type attenuators, hmr 3004 was a very weak inducer, unlike its cladinose counterpart ru 6652 and erythromycin. as expected, for the fusion originating from the constitutively resistant s. agalactiae strain, the level of uninduced beta-galactosidase synthesis was high. for one s. pneumoniae attenuator, mutations in the 3' end of the attenuator that weakened the stem-loop structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon for ermam methylase could explain the high level of uninduced beta-galactosidase produced.  for streptococci, the activity of hmr 3004 correlated with the basal level of beta-galactosidase synthesized. the weak inducer activity of hmr 3004 explained its activity against inducibly mlsb-resistant s. pneumoniae but did not correlate with the moderate activity of the antibiotic against inducibly resistant e. faecalis.

TI  == the streptococcus agalactiae hylb gene encoding hyaluronate lyase: completion of  the sequence and expression analysis.
AB  == we report the cloning, sequencing and expression analysis of the streptococcus agalactiae strain 4755 hylb4755 allele, the first chromosomally-encoded streptococcal hyaluronate lyase gene to be cloned and sequenced completely. this  gene lies in a region homologous to that found in s. mutans, between the mutx and rmlb genes, a region involved in the synthesis of the serotype c-specific polysaccharide antigen of this organism. sequencing of hylb4755 revealed a 3216-bp open reading frame that encodes a 121.2-kda polypeptide possessing a 30-amino acid signal sequence which was theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed. a recombinant plasmid, phyb100, containing hylb4755 together with its promoter and terminator was constructed and used to analyze the expression of the gene in escherichia coli. in northern hybridization experiments, hylb4755 was found to be transcribed as 3.3-kb monocistronic mrna from its own promoter which exhibits an extended, sigma70-like 10 consensus sequence. transcript mapping by primer extension analysis placed the major transcription initiation site leading to the longest transcript 38 bp upstream of the translational initiation codon, atg. e. coli tg1(phyb100) efficiently synthesized hyaluronan-cleaving enzyme activity at approximately 7000 working units/109 cells, with lyase activity detectable in all principle cellular locations. zymography and western analysis identified functional activity in tg1(phyb100) to be associated with approximately 118, 110 and 94-kda polypeptides, with the two low molecular weight species constituting the major components of the enzyme purified from the culture supernatant fluid of s. agalactiae 4755. the 118-kda form was shown to represent the undegraded mature enzyme, whereas the smaller species are likely to arise from proteolytic cleavage in the n-terminal part of the mature protein. the hylb4755 protein showed extensive sequence identity to the homologous enzymes from s. agalactiae 3502 and s. pneumoniae characterized by others but sequence comparisons clearly show that  incomplete genes truncated at their 5' ends had been isolated from these two organisms.

AB  == gv129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. it combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for gv129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes,  including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, gv129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. gv129606 showed an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, gv129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed mic90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family enterobacteriaceae with mic90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. against these species, gv129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with mic90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii).  haemophilus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of gv129606. gv129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. it was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). the in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ed50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. gv129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ed50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.

AB  == a strain of streptococcus agalactiae displayed resistance to 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides. in pcr assays, total genomic dna from this strain contained neither erm nor mef genes. ecori-digested genomic dna from this strain  was cloned into lambda zap ii to construct a library of s. agalactiae genomic dna. a clone, paes63, expressing resistance to erythromycin, azithromycin, and spiramycin in escherichia coli was recovered. deletion derivatives of paes63 which defined a functional region on this clone that encoded resistance to 14- and 15-membered, but not 16-membered, macrolides were produced. studies that determined the levels of incorporation of radiolabelled erythromycin into e. coli were consistent with the presence of a macrolide efflux determinant. this putative efflux determinant was distinct from the recently described mef pump in  streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae and from the multicomponent msra pump in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. its gene has been designated mrea (for macrolide resistance efflux).

TI  == [comparative antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

TI  == [trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  == we observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985,  1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified  in 254 among the 266 patients. their ages were less than 3 months after birth in  50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. the  causative organisms were h. influenzae in 134 patients and s. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. next to the above bacteria ranked s. agalactiae in 29 and e. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. l. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and n. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. s. pyogenes, enterococcus spp., peptostreptococcus spp., p. mirabilis and enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. the causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. h. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but s. pneumoniae  exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. there was a decreasing tendency with s. agalactiae and e. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. however, panipenem (phonetic) is  likely to be effective for insensible s. pneumoniae for the time being.

TI  == a prospective study of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in southern israel.
AB  == objective: to study the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the negev area of southern israel. design: a prospective 8-year study conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric wards of the soroka university medical center. results: two hundred twenty-nine cases of hospital and community-acquired neonatal sepsis occurred during the study period. thirty-two patients (14%) were meningitis. during this period 70,709 births (59% jews and 41% bedouins) were recorded; thus the rates of neonatal sepsis and meningitis were 3.2 and 0.5/1000 live births, respectively. one hundred seventeen (4/1000 live births) cases were recorded in bedouins and 112 (2.6/1000 live births) in jewish neonates (p < 0.001). twenty-six percent of all sepsis cases occurred within < 24 h from birth, 25% from days 2 to 7 of life and 49% between days 8 and 28. a total of 251 organisms that were considered true pathogens were isolated. fifty-seven of all isolates were gram-negative organisms (mainly klebsiella pneumoniae (20%) and escherichia coli (16%)). gram-positive organisms were isolated in 41% of cases. although e. coli was the most frequently recovered gram-negative pathogen in community-acquired late onset sepsis, klebsiella and enterobacter spp. represented the most commonly isolated gram-negative organisms  in nosocomial late onset sepsis. all staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered in  late onset sepsis were nosocomial. the incidence of streptococcus agalactiae was  3 times higher in early onset sepsis than in late onset sepsis. all cases of streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis occurred in bedouins. conclusions: neonatal sepsis and meningitis rates in southern israel are similar to those reported in western europe and the united states. the incidence of neonatal sepsis is significantly higher for bedouins than for jewish neonates. the distribution of the main pathogens is different in southern israel and although gram-negative enteric organisms are predominant, s. agalactiae plays a relatively minor role in the etiology of sepsis during the first month of life. in southern israel the etiology of community-acquired late onset sepsis is different from that of nosocomial late onset sepsis.

TI  == detection of meningitis antigens in buffer and body fluids by ultrasound-enhanced particle agglutination.
AB  == the standard test card agglutination of antibody-coated latex by neisseria meningitidis. streptococcus group b, haemophilus influenzae type b and streptococcus pneumoniae antigens has been compared with a technique involving local concentration of the coated latex in an ultrasonic standing wave. the detection of positive control antigen was enhanced, compared with the test-card procedure, over a 16 to 64 fold range on exposure to ultrasound. sample filtration eliminated non-specific agglutination on ultrasonic exposure of latex  in control serum, urine or concentrated urine. tests of meningitis patient body fluids showed increased detection of antigen with ultrasound for csf (11/14 > 7/14) serum (8/13 > 3/13) and concentrated urine (8/17 > 2/17) compared to test card assays. the ultrasound detection of antigen in serum or concentrated urine was comparable to that achieved with csf on test cards. serum dilution experiments showed that ultrasound could detect antigen in serum over a 1000 fold concentration range.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of roxithromycin against recently obtained clinical isolates].
AB  == the purpose of our investigation was to monitor current trends in the susceptibility patterns of clinical bacterial isolates to roxithromycin (rxm). we measured the mics of macrolide antibiotics, such as rxm, erythromycin (em), clarithromycin (cam), rokitamycin (rkm) and midecamycin (mdm), and other classes  of antibacterial compounds against various clinical isolates at seven institutions between october and december in 1994 and 1995. rxm had excellent antibacterial activities for s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and  methicillin sensitive s. aureus. against methicillin sensitive s. epidermidis, rxm activity was fairly good but about 20% of the strains had mic > or = 128 micrograms/ml. the activity against s. pneumoniae was not so potent and similar to activities of em, cam, mdm, and clindamycin. the vast majority of methicillin  resistant s. aureus and s. epidermidis were also resistant to macrolide antibiotics and other classes of compounds tested. in conclusion, rxm is an unique macrolide antibiotic by retaining potent activity against s. pyogenes, s.  agalactiae, s. aureus except mrsa, m. (b.) catarrhalis and m. pneumoniae.

TI  == [infectious bursitis: study of 40 cases in the pre-patellar and olecranon regions].
AB  == background: septic bursitis usually affects subcutaneous localized bursae such the prepatellar and elbow bursae. this condition is infrequently reported in the  spanish medical literature. the aim of this report was to study patients suffering from septic bursitis with regard to predisposing conditions, the causative agents, therapy and clinical outcome. method: a retrospective study was undertaken in patients with infectious bursitis attended in the service of rheumatology of the povisa medical centre (vigo) and juan canalejo hospital (la coruna), spain, from january 1989 to january 1995. the diagnosis of septic bursitis was confirmed with positive bursal fluid cultures in all cases. results: we recovered forty cases of infectious bursitis (23 olecranon bursitis and 17 prepatellar bursitis). most patients were male (80%), and patient mean age was 52 years (range: 14-94). the most common predisposing factors to bacterial infection were steroid therapy (15%) and alcoholism (8%), in addition to cutaneous lesions  associated with occupational or recreational trauma (55%). prepatellar septic bursitis was associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation with fever (71% vs 48%), leukocytosis (76% vs 52%), cellulitis (59% vs 48%) and positive blood cultures (25% vs 0%). staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 87.5% of bursal fluid aspirations, the other etiologic microrganism were staphylococcus epidermidis (2 cases), streptococcus agalactiae (2 cases) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 case). the majority of patients (80%) required initial intravenous  therapy of which average duration was 11 days (range: 5-21 days). successful resolution of septic bursitis without open surgical drainage was seen in 38 patients (95%) and there ware no functional impairment, serious complications or  recurrences. conclusions: the majority of patients with septic bursitis suffered  systemic and/or local predisposing illness. s. aureus is the commonest pathogen.  prepatellar septic bursitis is associated with a more aggressive clinical presentation and bacteremia. usually, the prompt and proper antibiotic therapy make innecessary surgical drainage.

TI  == lancefield grouping and smell of caramel for presumptive identification and assessment of pathogenicity in the streptococcus milleri group.
AB  == aim: to evaluate lancefield grouping and caramel smell for presumptive identification of the streptococcus milleri group, and to find whether lancefield group, species, or protein profile correlated with virulence or infection site. methods: prospective studies were made of 100 consecutive streptococcal isolates  in blood cultures or pus from 100 patients in whom the severity of infection was  categorised as serious, moderate, or not significant. the usefulness of lancefield group and the caramel smell for presumptive identification was examined, and the relation of the s milleri species, lancefield group, and sds-page protein analysis to severity of infection and infection site was investigated. lower respiratory tract and genital tract specimens, strict anaerobes, group d streptococci, and strains identified as streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, or streptococcus agalactiae were excluded. results: most streptococci occurring in pure or significant growth density were s milleri group (87/100; 87%, 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.93). of these, 89.7% (78/87; 0.84-0.96) were associated with infection. lancefield group f antigen predominated (41/87; 47.1%, 0.38-0.56). lancefield group f alone or accompanied by the caramel smell had a specificity of 100%, but a sensitivity of only 47.3% for group f alone, and 19.5% for group f accompanied by the caramel smell. there  was no significant association between species, lancefield group, and severity of infection, site of infection, or pathogenicity. sds-page analysis failed to discriminate between strains. conclusions: neither species nor lancefield antigen was related to the site of infection. the presence of lancefield group f antigen  alone or accompanied by a caramel smell was a useful indicator for the s milleri  group when present, but was too insensitive to use as a screening test. most streptococci occurring in pure culture or in significant growth density were of clinical importance. such organisms should be identified to species level to detect the s milleri group.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the hyaluronate lyase gene from propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == the hyaluronate lyase (hyaluronidase) gene from propionibacterium acnes was cloned and sequenced. the gene was isolated on an ecori-generated 3-kb piece of dna. expression was less in escherichia coli than in p. acnes; in e. coli, active enzyme was only cell associated and not secreted. the gene is 2256-pb long and codes for a protein of 82 kda. amino terminal sequencing of the protein of the partially purified gene indicated the presence of a 32-amino-acid leader sequence. the leader sequence showed a membrane-spanning domain and all of the features usually associated with the leader for a secreted protein. the amino acid sequence is predicted to share homology with the hyaluronidase enzymes from  streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus. a  potential hyaluronate-binding domain was identified and antibody against this domain was inhibitory to the enzyme.

TI  == nmr and molecular dynamics studies of the conformational epitope of the type iii  group b streptococcus capsular polysaccharide and derivatives.
AB  == the conformational epitope of the type iii group b streptococcus capsular polysaccharide (gbsp iii) exhibits unique properties which can be ascribed to the presence of sialic acid in its structure and the requirement for an extended binding site. by means of nmr and molecular dynamics studies on gbsp iii and its  fragments, the extended epitope of gbsp iii was further defined. the influence of sialic acid on the conformational properties of gbsp iii was examined by performing conformational analysis on desialylated gbsp iii, which is identical to the polysaccharide of streptococcus pneumoniae type 14, and also on oxidized and reduced gbsp iii. conformational changes were gauged by 1h and 13c chemical shift analysis, noe, 1d selective tocsy-noesy experiments, j(hh) and j(ch) variations, and noe of oh resonances. changes in mobility were examined by 13c t1 and t2 measurements. unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations with explicit water using the amber force field and the glycam parameter set were used to assess static and dynamic conformational models, simulate the observable nmr parameters and calculate helical parameters. gbsp iii was found to be capable of  forming extended helices. hence, the length dependence of the conformational epitope could be explained by its location on extended helices within the random  coil structure of gbsp iii. the interaction of sialic acid with the backbone of the ps was also found to be important in defining the conformational epitope of gbsp iii.

TI  == a method for determination of the absolute configuration of chiral glycerol residues in natural products using tempo oxidation and characterization of the glyceric acids formed.
AB  == a method has been developed for determination of the absolute configuration of glycerol residues in natural products. it is required that the glycerol moiety contain a primary nonsubstituted hydroxymethyl group or that such a group can be  obtained by modification without racemization. the method employs tempo oxidation of the primary hydroxyl group, hydrolysis, butanolysis with chiral 2-butanol, and acetylation. the acetylated (+)-2-butyl esters of the glyceric acid formed by oxidation are analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. the esterification can also  be performed with other chiral alcohols, e.g., (-)-2-octanol. the method is general and applicable to both primary and secondary substituted glycerols. it has recently been used for determination of the chiral glycerol-1-phosphate residue of the escherichia coli o28 o-antigen, and now we report the absolute configurations of the glycerol moieties in streptococcus pneumoniae type 18a and  streptococcus agalactaie type iii. all studied glycerol residues were found to have the d-configuration.

TI  == neurotoxicity of glia activated by gram-positive bacterial products depends on nitric oxide production.
AB  == the present study examined the mechanism by which bacterial cell walls from two gram-positive meningeal pathogens, streptococcus pneumoniae and the group b streptococcus, induced neuronal injury in primary cultures of rat brain cells. cell walls from both organisms produced cellular injury to similar degrees in pure astrocyte cultures but not in pure neuronal cultures. cell walls also induced nitric oxide production in cultures of astrocytes or microglia. when neurons were cultured together with astrocytes or microglia, the cell walls of both organisms became toxic to neurons. l-name, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, protected neurons from cell wall-induced toxicity in mixed cultures with glia, as did dexamethasone. in contrast, an excitatory amino acid antagonist (mk801) had no effect. low concentrations of cell walls from either gram-positive pathogen added together with the excitatory amino acid glutamate resulted in synergistic neurotoxicity that was inhibited by l-name. the induction of nitric oxide production and neurotoxicity by cell walls was independent of the presence  of serum, whereas endotoxin exhibited these effects only in the presence of serum. we conclude that gram-positive cell walls can cause toxicity in neurons by inducing the production of nitric oxide in astrocytes and microglia.

TI  == the capsule polysaccharide synthesis locus of streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14: identification of the glycosyl transferase gene cps14e.
AB  == to identify a chromosomal region of streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 involved in capsule polysaccharide synthesis, two strategies were used: (i) tn916 mutagenesis, followed by the characterization of four unencapsulated mutants, and (ii) cross-hybridization with a capsule polysaccharide synthesis gene (cps) probe from s. agalactiae, which has a structurally similar capsule. the two approaches  detected the same chromosomal region consisting of two adjacent ecori fragments.  one of these ecori fragments was cloned and hybridized with a cosmid library. this resulted in clone cmko2. a similar cosmid clone was obtained from an unencapsulated tn916 mutant, spnl4.h. sequence analysis of the two cosmid clones  revealed that in the tn916 mutant, a gene, cps14e, which is homologous to other bacterial genes encoding glycosyl transferases, had been inactivated. an open reading frame immediately downstream of cps14e, designated cps14f, shows no significant homology with any known genes or proteins. a functional assay showed  that cps14e encodes a glycosyl transferase and that a gene-specific knockout mutant lacks this enzyme activity, whereas inactivation of cps14f does not have this effect.

AB  == in order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of meropenem (mepm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of mepm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid that were obtained from january, 1993 to december, 1994. the results are summarized as follows; 1. the mic-range, 50% mic (mic50) and 90% mic (mic90) of mepm were equal to those of imipenem (ipm) and panipenem (papm) against streptococcus pneumoniae including benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive or -resistant s. pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae and listeria monocytogenes which are gram-positive strains, and were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and cefotaxime (ctx). 2. the mic-range,  mic50 and mic90 of these 3 drugs of carbapenems (mepm, ipm and papm) were different against escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae which are gram-negative strains. the mic90 of mepm was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml and those  of ipm and papm were 0.2 microgram/ml against e. coli. the mic90 of mepm was 0.1  microgram/ml, that of ipm was 25 micrograms/ml and that of papm was 6.25 micrograms/ml against h. influenzae. thus, the antimicrobial activity of mepm was stronger than those of ipm and papm. the mic90's of ipm and papm against h. influenzae were high with the mic of ipm at 12.5 approximately 25 micrograms/ml and the mic of papm at 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml against 3 ipm-resistant strains among 17 isolates. 3. the mic90 of abpc was 0.39 microgram/ml and that of ctx was 0.1 microgram/ml against 20 strains of s. pneumoniae including 6 strains of pcg-insensitive or resistant s. pneumoniae. the mic90 of abpc and ctx were higher than those of 3 carbapenem drugs. there were e. coli of 8 strains with abpc-high resistance (the mic of abpc was > 100 micrograms/ml) and 2 strains for which mic of ctx were 0.39 microgram/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was found that 29.4% of h. influenzae were beta-lactamase producing strains. 4. it appeared that antimicrobial activities of carbapenems, particularly mepm were strong against clinical isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. mepm will be first choice drug by empiric therapy in infections including sepsis and purulent meningitis.

TI  == identification and characterization of the eps (exopolysaccharide) gene cluster from streptococcus thermophilus sfi6.
AB  == we report the identification and characterization of the eps gene cluster of streptococcus thermophilus sfi6 required for exopolysaccharide (eps) synthesis. this report is the first genetic work concerning eps production in a food microorganism. the eps secreted by this strain consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->3)-[alpha-d-galp-(1-->6)]-beta-d- d-galp-(1-->3)-alpha-d-galp-d-galpnac-(1-->. the genetic locus the genetic locus  was identified by tn916 mutagenesis in combination with a plate assay to identify eps mutants. sequence analysis of the gene region, which was obtained from subclones of a genomic library of sfi6, revealed a 15.25-kb region encoding 15 open reading frames. eps expression in the non-eps-producing heterologous host, lactococcus lactis mg1363, showed that within the 15.25-kb region, a region with  a size of 14.52 kb encoding the 13 genes epsa to epsm was capable of directing eps synthesis and secretion in this host. homology searches of the predicted proteins in the swiss-prot database revealed high homology (40 to 68% identity) for epsa, b, c, d, and e and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus agalactiae. moderate to low homology (37 to 18% identity) was detected for epsb, d, f, and h and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in staphylococcus aureus for epsc, d, and e and the genes involved in exopolysaccharide i (epsi) synthesis in rhizobium meliloti for epsc to epsj and the genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis in members of the  enterobacteriaceae, and finally for eps k and lipb of neisseria meningitidis. genes (epsj, epsl, and epsm) for which the predicted proteins showed little or no homology with proteins in the swiss-prot database were shown to be involved in eps synthesis by single-crossover gene disruption experiments.

TI  == diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. however, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human csf and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the csf of animals infected with streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean changes in bacterial colony count in csf after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the csf that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. no study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight european countries.
AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. the in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. cefetamet killed 100% haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing  strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae at < or =  0.5 mg/l, s. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l.  moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective  against escherichia coli (94%), klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), k. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x mic demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing h.  influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and k. pneumoniae within 6 h and s. pneumoniae within 4 h. hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to tem1 and shv1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.

TI  == an approach to the identification of the pathogens of bacterial meningitis by the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a combination of universal and species-specific primers was used to detect and differentiate by nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) the four species most commonly causing bacterial meningitis. primers recognising conserved sequences in the 16s and 23s ribosomal rna genes were employed to amplify the 16s-23s spacer region from neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae (type b), streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus). the sequence of the most abundant spacer product was determined in each case and  used to deduce species-specific primers. a nested pcr using universal primers in  the first round and a species-specific primer in the second were able to detect and distinguish between the four common pathogens, in the presence of human dna.  streptococcus pneumoniae dna was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of a meningitis patient with negative culture and gram-stain results.

AB  == plasma fibronectic (pfn) is a high molecular weight multifunction glycoprotein, which augments neutrophil and macrofage phagocytosis and acts as a nonspecific opsonin for the reticuloendothelial system. in this study we have determined pfn  concentrations in fifty eight preterm infants to discriminate infected from non infected ones. concentrations of pfn decreased from baselin in babies with early  or late onset infections. the changes in pfn concentrations were not found before sepsis, but on day 1. by day 5 pfn concentrations have increased and have been no longer different from controls. we have calculated sensitivity (73.68%), specificity (74.36%), positive (58.35%) and negative (85.29%) predictive values of pfn and of other markers of infections (c-reactive protein--crp-, immature/mature neutrophil ratio--i/m n. ratio-). adding these tests to pfn, provided equal specificity and positive predictive value, but increased sensitivity (94.73%) and negative predictive value (96.43%). thus, low concentrations of pfn may be a valuable but not early marker for neonatal infections. the combination of pfn, crp and i/m n. ratio increase the precision of diagnostic testing.

AB  == background: identifying febrile children with invasive bacterial infection is difficult in the absence of telltale physical findings. urine latex agglutination (ula) tests have been used for rapid, on-site identification of such children. objectives: to study the performance of ula tests in identifying children with haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and group b streptococcus infection and to examine how the results of ula tests affect patient treatment. design: retrospective review. setting: urban children's hospital. patients: all emergency department and hospital patients tested by ula in 1990, excluding patients in the neonatal units. results: of 1629 patients, 36 had positive tests  (20 h influenzae, 5 s pneumoniae, and 11 group b streptococcus). thirteen of these were false positive based on culture results. although ula tests demonstrated excellent specificity, their sensitivity was poor. positive predictive values for bacteremia ranged from 0.346 to 0.600, and negative predictive values ranged from 0.972 to 0.997. the decision to treat with antibiotics was made before ula test results were available in 19 (53%) of the 36 patients with positive test results. of 1593 patients with negative test results, 1211 (76%) were admitted to the hospital, and approximately 81% were empirically  treated with parenteral antibiotics. conclusions: in clinical practice, treatment and disposition decisions are frequently made without regard to ula test results.

TI  == latex particle agglutination tests on the cerebrospinal fluid. a reappraisal.
AB  == rapid diagnostic tests are often used to identify microbial etiology of infection early. latex particle agglutination (lpa) tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (csf)  are frequently used for purpose of rapid diagnosis. we evaluated their usefulness in management of patients with suspected meningitis. we also evaluated the cost effectiveness of lpas during an 11-month period; 1,540 csf specimens were tested  for h. influenzae type b, group b streptococcal (gbs), n. meningitidis and s. pneumoniae using lpas. only 27 were positive. lpas were useful in management of only the neonates with gbs infection. on the whole, lpas were very expensive and  not cost-effective.

TI  == [yearly changes of isolated organisms from the respiratory tract in hokusho central hospital].
AB  == isolated organisms from the respiratory tract have been studied in our hospital from 1986 to 1993. the total number of samples were 18,345 and samples which showed 10(5) cfu/ml organisms were 8648 in our hospital for 8 years. enterobacteriacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus  pneumoniae, and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative rods were major isolates in 8 years. haemophilus influenzae, which used to be the commonest isolate, decreased  from 10.9% in 1993 while enterobacteriacae increased from 8.9% in 1986 to 17.6% in 1993. s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae were major isolates from out-patients consisting of 50%, followed by enterobacteriacae, p. aeruginosa and mssa. enterobacteriacae and p. aeruginosa were major isolates from in-patients, followed by mrsa and beta-streptococcus. streptococcus agalactiae, serratia marcescens and corynebacterium spp. prevailed especially in the geriatric ward. s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were major isolates from patients with pneumoconiosis, especially in winter.

TI  == cloning and expression of the gene for group b streptococcal hyaluronate lyase.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are a major cause of serious human perinatal infections. most clinical isolates of gbs secrete hyaluronate lyase, and production of high levels of the enzyme has been associated with strain virulence. degenerate oligonucleotide primers, designed on the basis of the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides prepared from the purified enzyme, permitted the polymerase chain reaction amplification from gbs chromosomal dna of a 363-base pair internal dna fragment of the gbs hyaluronate lyase gene (hylb). this dna fragment was used as a probe to screen a lambda phage library of gbs chromosomal dna fragments. sequence analysis of positive clones identified an open reading frame capable of coding for a 111-kda protein. since no single clone was found to contain the entire gene it was necessary to reconstruct the gene from two plasmids containing inserts with suitable overlapping sequences. when this reconstructed gene was transformed into escherichia coli, high level expression of hyaluronate lyase activity was obtained.

TI  == comparison of ballard catheter bronchoalveolar lavage with bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage.
AB  == background: bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) in mechanically ventilated patients requires a large endotracheal tube, physician expertise, expensive equipment, and support staff. methods: the ballard bal catheter is a disposable coude tip 16f device that can be attached to the endotracheal tube and ventilator circuit without loss of positive end-expiratory pressure (peep) and also allows supplemental delivery of oxygen between the 12f inner and outer catheters. the catheter is directed into the selected bronchus. the inner catheter with mushroom tip is then advanced until it wedges by feel. thirteen patients at a tertiary care, university hospital, had bal performed through both the bronchoscope and ballard bal catheter using five aliquots of 20 ml of normal saline solution each. the return was quantified and submitted for blinded, paired laboratory investigations, including gram stain and quantitative culture, and special stains and cultures as clinically appropriate. results: the procedure was well tolerated in all patients with no difference between devices in oxygen saturations; however, air leaks occurred in patients undergoing bronchoscopy and compromised safety in one. two patients required reintubation to facilitate passage of the bronchoscope. the bronchoscopic bal return averaged 49 ml (range, 5 to 85 ml) while bal catheter averaged 37 ml (range, 18 to 70 ml) both being sufficient for  all desired investigations except one patient who had undergone bronchoscopy. all were of excellent quality based on microscopy. the bal results were concordant in nine patients: two pneumocystis carinii, one candida, one streptococcus agalactiae, one streptococcus pneumoniae, and no infection in four. diagnoses of  tuberculosis and enterococcus (confirmed by blood culture) were obtained by the ballard bal catheter only. kaposi's sarcoma and metastatic histiosarcoma were visualized by bronchoscope only. two patients had compassionate plea use of the ballard bal catheter because of a small endotracheal tube. hemorrhage secondary to lupus was documented in one and nosocomial infection was excluded in the other. conclusions: the ballard bal catheter allows easy, safe bal, without loss  of diagnostic yield, when visualization is not required in mechanically ventilated patients. the ballard bal catheter allows maintenance of peep when used with the supplied adapter and can be used with small endotracheal tubes.

TI  == nucleotide sequence analysis of genes essential for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in streptococcus pneumoniae type 19f.
AB  == previous studies have shown that the capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) locus of the type 19f streptococcus pneumoniae strain ssz was closely linked to a copy of the insertion sequence is1202 (j.k. morona, a. guidolin, r. morona, d. hansman, and j.c. paton, j. bacteriol. 176:4437-4443, 1994). in the present study, we used plasmid insertion and rescue and inverse pcr to clone 6,322 bp of  flanking dna upstream of is1202. sequence analysis indicated that this region contains six complete open reading frames (orfs) and one partial orf that are arranged as a single transcriptional unit. chromosomal disruption of any of these orfs in a smooth-type 19f strain leads to a rough (unencapsulated) phenotype, indicating that this operon is essential for capsule production. the orfs have therefore been designated cps19fa to cps19fg, where cps19fa is the first gene of  the type 19f cps locus. furthermore, many of the gene products from this incomplete operon exhibit strong similarities to proteins known to be involved in the production of capsular polysaccharide, exopolysaccharide, teichoic acid, enterobacterial common antigen, and lipopolysaccharide from numerous other bacterial species. this has allowed us to propose functions for many of the type  19f cps gene products. southern hybridization studies reveal that cps19fa and cps19fb are conserved among all 12 pneumococcal serotypes tested, whereas genes downstream of cps19fb are conserved among some, but not all, of the serotypes tested.

TI  == opsonic activity of commercially available standard intravenous immunoglobulin preparations.
AB  == several standard intravenous immunoglobulin g (ivig) products are available in the united states and have been used with the intent to treat or prevent infections in neonates. we evaluated more than 100 lots of ivig, from 6 products, to determine the amount of opsonic antibody against neonatal pathogens. neutrophil-mediated opsonophagocytosis was used to determine opsonic activity in  these preparations for staphylococcus epidermidis; haemophilus influenzae type b; streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 14 and 19; group b streptococcus serotypes  ia, ib, ia/c, ii and iii; and escherichia coli (k1). pathogen-specific opsonic activity of the lots tested ranged from undetectable to 1:80 and was detectable in < 10% to > 90% of lots tested depending on the organism and manufacturer. within an ivig lot there was variable opsonic activity against different strains  or serotypes of the same organism. opsonic activity was significantly (p < or = 0.05) affected by the manufacturer's donor pool and less so by the manufacturing  method. we conclude that the pathogen-specific opsonic antibody activity of an ivig lot is: (1) highly variable for several common neonatal pathogens; (2) predominantly dependent on the donor pool and not the manufacturing method. clinicians may more appropriately select therapy if the pathogen-specific antibody content of ivig products by lot are known. in the future neonatal ivig research should focus on using preparations with known pathogen-specific antibody activity.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in cerebrospinal fluid by an assay for simultaneous detection of neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and streptococci using a seminested pcr strategy.
AB  == primers specific to conserved and variable regions in the 16s rrna sequence were  selected from the partially sequenced 16s rrna genes of neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the pcr assay was divided into two dna amplifications. the first resulted in a general bacterial amplicon, and the second resulted in a species-specific amplicon. the high specificity of the pcr assay was documented after testing bacteria of 28 different species (133 strains). a total of 304 clinical cerebrospinal fluid samples, including 125 samples from patients with bacterial meningitis, were assayed to investigate the  diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for bacterial meningitis. the assay showed high sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (0.96) with the clinical samples, although some false results were obtained, the reasons for which are discussed. with agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the pcr products, the detection limit for meningococci in cerebrospinal fluid was 3 x 10(2) cfu/ml.

TI  == [epidemiology of primary bacterial meningitis].
AB  == in industrialized countries, the incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis is between 5 and 10 cases/10(5) population/year. the highest age-specific attack rates are recorded between 0 and 2 years of age and can reach 100 cases/10(5) population/year or more in some countries. in this range of age,  streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli are responsible for meningitis in neonates whereas haemophilus influenzae, neisseria  meningitidis and streptococcus pneumoniae cause meningitis in children older than 1 month. h. influenzae was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children  but its incidence has declined since the introduction of routine childhood immunization with conjugate vaccines. n. meningitidis is the leading cause of meningitis in teenagers and young adults, whereas s. pneumoniae is responsible for most of meningitis in the elderly. prognosis of bacterial meningitis mainly depends on the type of causative organism and on the age of onset. detailed epidemiologic features of haemophilus, meningococcal and pneumococcal meningitis  are provided.

TI  == binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  == mannan-binding protein (mbp), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. after binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, mbp activates the classical pathway of the complement system. to investigate the binding capacity of mbp to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of mbp to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (lps)), used as a positive control  strain, showed binding of radiolabelled mbp at a level of 80% compared with binding of mbp to zymosan. binding of labelled mbp to salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. the binding was inhibited by unlabelled mbp, by mannose and by n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of mbp binding capacities could be determined. the encapsulated neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group a were included: n = 22), n. mucosa (n = 1),  haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low mbp binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (ci) 3.3-40.1%). escherichia coli k1 (n = 11), strep. suis (n = 5), strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and n. meningitidis serogroup a (n = 2) showed intermediate mbp binding capacity of 58.4% (95% ci 40.0-76.8%). a third group consisting of non-encapsulated listeria  monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated h. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated  n. meningitidis (n = 2), n. cinera (n = 1) and n. subflava (n = 1) strains had a  high mbp binding capacity of 87.5% (95% ci 62.5-112.5%). the majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low mbp binding capacity.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. the study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). in addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent  of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. the organisms tested  were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups c and g, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis. minimal inhibitory concentrations of  the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. cefpodoxime  showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral  beta-lactam antibiotics examined. the drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.

TI  == the effects of nonclassic pediatric bacterial pathogens on the usefulness of the  directigen latex agglutination test.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae type b, escherichia coli, neisseria meningitis, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae are classically the predominant meningeal pathogens of children. the directigen latex agglutination test identifies these pathogens by detecting specific antigens in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and urine. the authors tested 1151 specimens from 791 children with suspected meningeal infections. they found that the sensitivity of the directigen test for detecting the five classic csf pathogens of children was 83.3% with csf  and 60% with urine specimens. in detecting all pathogens, however, the sensitivity was only 50% with csf and 37.5% with urine. thus, an increased prevalence of nonclassic pathogens in a pediatric population adversely affects the efficacy of the directigen test for confirming a diagnosis of meningitis and  emphasizes the diagnostic importance of the clinical history and other routine csf tests.

AB  == concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after  a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. the mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. the mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per  gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. these drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus; for streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired enterobacteriaceae. the average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. the lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

AB  == a set of broad-range pcr primers for the 16s rrna gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the pcr product. the  first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a bacteroides-flavobacterium probe, and two probes  for other gram-negative species. the second series was designed to detect pcr products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, listeria  monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the third series was designed for the detection of dna from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (csf): bacillus,  corynebacterium, propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. the primers amplified dna from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 m tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being  deinococcus radiopugnans and gardnerella vaginalis. the gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria,  alloiococcus otitis and rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by gram stain characteristics. the csf pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. testing of the csf pathogen and contaminant probes against dna from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in csf.

AB  == objective: to report a case series of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with  resistant enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the  membranes (prom) and group b streptococcus. methods: maternal and neonatal records were reviewed of four cases in which adverse perinatal outcomes occurred  from resistant enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for either prom or positive group b streptococcal cultures. information on clinical setting, antibiotic usage, maternal and neonatal complications, and maternal and neonatal  cultures was noted. results: all four cases were complicated by prom at 25-35 weeks' gestation. ampicillin or amoxicillin was used in several clinical settings, including therapeutically for the presence of group b streptococcus, presumptively for prom, and prophylactically pending the results of group b streptococcal cultures. clinical chorioamnionitis subsequently developed in all four cases, and in two cases the maternal course was prolonged and complicated by persistent fever and the need for therapy for pelvic vein thrombophlebitis. two neonates died from fulminant clinical sepsis. a third infant, one of a twin gestation, was stillborn, presumably because of sepsis. in three cases, neonatal  and placental cultures revealed escherichia coli resistant to ampicillin; in the  fourth case, klebsiella pneumoniae was identified, with only intermediate sensitivity to ampicillin. conclusion: resistant enterobacteriaceae associated with adverse perinatal outcomes may result from the use of antibiotics, such as ampicillin or amoxicillin, after prom. in deciding whether antibiotic therapy for prom or group b streptococcal prophylaxis is appropriate, the value of purported  benefits must be weighed against presumably infrequent but serious outcomes, including neonatal sepsis and death due to selection or overgrowth of resistant organisms.

TI  == streptococcal update. a microbiology perspective.
AB  == the streptococci remain important human pathogens despite it being nearly 60 years since sulphonamides were introduced. rheumatic fever and post glomerulonephritis are common diseases in the aboriginal community, and a new invasive disease, toxic shock-like syndrome, is also caused by group a streptococcus. group b, first described over 50 years ago in obstetric wards remains the primary neonatal pathogen despite attempts to eliminate this organism from the genital tract of the carrier mother. a major concern in paediatrics is the relatively poor response to the current pneumococcal vaccines. australian researchers are playing a major role in developing a new vaccine with high antigenicity against all of the 100 odd serotypes of s pneumoniae. the oral streptococci are now recognised as important opportunistic pathogens and the pathogenesis is well defined. disturbing reports from different geographical regions alert us to the antibiotic resistance in some of the streptococci once thought of as sensitive bacteria, for example, group a has shown resistance to erythromycin, the pneumococcus to penicillin and beta-lactam antibiotics and the  aminoglycosides have been ineffective against the enterococci due to plasmid-borne genes.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (cam) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, moraxella, haemophilus and bacteroides  strains. mics80's of cam against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. mics80's against moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. laboratory-induced resistance to cam in strains of s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. adherence to silicon filter of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa or s. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-mic of cam or other macrolides. although tosufloxacin (tflx) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of p. aeruginosa strains tested, tflx showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-mics of cam or erythromycin.

TI  == neonatal sepsis and meningitis in mallorca, spain, 1977-1991.
AB  == in a retrospective study at son dureta hospital (palma de mallorca, mallorca, spain) of the period 1977-1991, 334 cases of culture-proven sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates born at the facility were identified. overall, there was an incidence rate of 4.9 cases per 1,000 live births. the case-fatality rate was  7.5%. infection was more frequent in infants of low birth weight, with the exception of infants with meningitis and infections due to group b streptococcus  and listeria species. the patterns of predominance among bacterial pathogens that were isolated changed during the period studied. from 1977 to 1984, klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent such isolate, but this frequency declined in the following years. group b streptococcus organisms and staphylococcus epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and staphylococcus  epidermidis replaced k. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and late-onset infections, respectively. the frequency with which other pathogens were isolated did not vary significantly during the study period. invasive infection caused by candida organisms was found in two patients. the incidence of infection due to group b streptococci has increased in the last few years (to 2.4 cases per 1,000 live births in 1991) and has become a significant problem that requires a thorough epidemiological evaluation.

TI  == nucleotide sequence analysis of the termini and chromosomal locus involved in site-specific integration of the streptococcal conjugative transposon tn5252.
AB  == the 47-kb, broad-host-range, streptococcal conjugative transposon tn5252 is capable of site-specific integration into the pneumococcal chromosome. we present the nucleotide sequence of the terminal regions of the transposon and its target  site in the pneumococcal genome. no inverted repeats were found at the termini of the transposon. a 72-bp region of the target was present on either side following the insertion of tn5252 and appeared to serve as a signal for its integration and excision. the data suggest that the left copy of the 72-bp segment was a part of  the conjugative element, the crossover point of integration was nonrandom within  this region, and the mechanism of insertion could resemble that of the site-specific temperate phages.

TI  == correlating infectious outcome with clinical parameters of 1130 consecutive febrile infants aged zero to eight weeks.
AB  == the study objectives were to characterize the infectious outcomes and associated  clinical parameters of a large group of febrile young infants who received outpatient sepsis evaluation. this retrospective review of consecutive cases during a seven-year period was set in an urban pediatric emergency department. febrile infants, aged zero to eight weeks, were the participants. all received a  standard evaluation for sepsis, including complete blood count/blood culture, lumbar puncture/cerebrospinal fluid culture, and urinalysis/urine culture. of 1130 patients, 447 (42%) were aged zero to four weeks, and 683 (58%) were aged four to eight weeks. in 96 cases (8.5%), a bacterial pathogen was isolated by culture of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine, or stool; 58% were aged zero to four weeks and 42% were aged four to eight weeks. the rate of positive cultures per patient age was doubled in those aged zero to four weeks (12%) compared with  those aged four to eight weeks (6%). the 49 cases of invasive bacterial infections (bacterial meningitis/bacteremia) were most commonly associated with lower degrees of fever, as slightly over one half (25/49) had temperature < 39 degrees c. the most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection were group b streptococcus and escherichia coli, accounting for 33 of 49 cases (67%); the most common pathogens of invasive bacterial infection in older children (haemophilus influenzae type b and streptococcus pneumoniae) were relatively underrepresented, accounting for only five of these 49 (10%) cases.

TI  == cefprozil. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential.
AB  == cefprozil is an orally active cephalosporin which has demonstrated activity against a wide range of organisms in vitro. it is particularly active against the gram-positive organisms streptococcus pyogenes, pneumoniae and agalactiae and against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus are not susceptible to cefprozil. cefprozil is also moderately active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, many enterobacteriaceae and certain anaerobic organisms, and is relatively stable to hydrolysis by a number of beta-lactamases. in comparative trials, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil 500mg  or 20 mg/kg administered once or twice daily has been comparable with multiple daily dosage regimens of erythromycin in patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis, with cefaclor and amoxicillin/clavulanate in lower respiratory tract infections, with amoxicillin/clavulanate and erythromycin in skin and skin-structure infections and with cefaclor in acute uncomplicated urinary tract  infections. the clinical efficacy of cefprozil is similar to that of cefaclor in  patients with tonsillitis or pharyngitis but the bacteriological efficacy of cefprozil is significantly greater than that of cefaclor. cefprozil is clinically more effective than cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and demonstrated greater efficacy than cefaclor in one of 2 comparative studies when administered twice daily in patients with skin and skin-structure infections. in children with acute otitis media, cefprozil 15 mg/kg twice daily was as effective as cefaclor or amoxicillin/clavulanate 13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily and was as effective as cefixime 8 mg/kg once daily. the most frequently reported adverse effects associated with cefprozil, diarrhoea and nausea, are usually mild to moderate in severity and discontinuation of treatment is rarely necessary. thus, cefprozil with its convenient administration regimen appears to be a suitable alternative to cefaclor, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate or erythromycin for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin-structure infections, and otitis media in children. while cefprozil has shown similar efficacy to cefaclor in the  treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, well-controlled clinical trials comparing its efficacy with that of cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim+sulfamethoxazole) in this indication are required.

TI  == immunodiagnosis of group-a streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  == seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-a streptococci were generated. all of them were of igm isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-a streptococci and polysaccharide. these were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-b, -c, -g and staphylococcus aureus. polyclonal antibodies against group-a polysaccharide (aps) were also raised in rabbits by linking aps to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. the assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng aps/ml as compared to 1 microgram aps/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-b, -c, -g, staph. aureus, cornybacterium diptheriae, candida albicans, candida spp., morexella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, strep. pneumoniae. salmonella typhi and s. paratyphi a and b. throat  swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-a, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout japan. possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (rkm) were examined against these isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined through  a comparative study with reference drugs. the results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (mls) with mic values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring mls with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin  (cam), and 85.2% between em and oleandomycin (ol). fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring mls than to 14-membered ring mls. cross resistances observed among the staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (mdm-ac) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (lm)), 93.9% between mdm-ac and josamycin (jm), and 53.3% between mdm-ac and rkm. streptococcus spp. and peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but resistance patterns to rkm were quite different. most of anaerobic streptococci and bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but in some cases a pattern similar to  that of staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. when ml-resistant bacteria isolated  during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980,  but that of streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. most of ml-resistances of the  resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring mls were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring mls. rkm appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. from these results, it appears that the rkm is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.

TI  == identification and characterization of a surface protein-releasing activity in streptococcus mutans and other pathogenic streptococci.
AB  == surface proteins of streptococcus mutans have been reported to be released into the culture filtrate at concentrations that vary with the growth conditions. the  reason for this is not clear. the present study attempts to investigate the mechanism of the protein release. the results showed that whole cells and raffinose-stabilized protoplasts of s. mutans ng8, when incubated in buffers, were capable of releasing their surface proteins in a ph-dependent manner with optimal release at ph 5 to 6. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the released proteins were very complex. two proteins, adhesin p1, which has been previously shown to interact with a human salivary agglutinin, and glucosyltransferase have been identified among the released proteins. the release of adhesin p1 and other proteins was found to be inhibited by heat, cu2+,zn2+, and thiol-blocking reagents. the inhibition by heat and cu2+ was irreversible, whereas that by the thiol-blocking reagents was reversible. edta, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and n-p-tosyl-l-lysyl-chloromethyl ketone had no effect on the release of p1, indicating that the release was probably not due to proteolytic activity. adhesin p1 from cu(2+)-inactivated s. mutans ng8 protoplasts could be released by mixing  with fresh whole cells and protoplasts, but not the culture filtrate, of a p1-negative mutant of ng8, suggesting that the enzyme is located on the cell surface. this p1-releasing activity was also detected in two other strains of s.  mutans and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, and s. pyogenes. the biological role(s) of this enzyme activity remains to be determined. however, owing to its ability to release virulent surface proteins from the cell, it may play an important role in cell surface modulation among the pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical evaluations of flomoxef sodium in neonates].
AB  == flomoxef sodium (fmox) was evaluated experimentally and clinically in neonates. 1. serum concentrations and urinary excretions of the drug were examined after a  bolus intravenous injection at 20 mg/kg to 22 neonates 1-30 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 31-43 weeks, weights at birth 1,650-4,040 g) and 5 infants 50-95 days after birth (durations of pregnancy 33-40 weeks, weights at birth 1,720-3,308 g). serum concentrations were 10.8-67.6 micrograms/ml (mean 32.7 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml) and 25.1-52.0 micrograms/ml (mean 38.9 +/- 4.3 micrograms/ml) in the neonates and the infants, respectively, at their peaks (0.5 hour value), decreased thereafter with half-lives of 0.96-5.59 hours (mean 2.20 +/- 0.26 hours value), and 0.97-1.54 hours (mean 1.22 +/- 0.12 hours value), respectively. serum levels decreased to 0.2-17.1 micrograms/ml (mean 2.9 +/- 0.6  micrograms/ml) and n.d. -1.1 micrograms/ml (mean 0.4 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml) after 8 hours, respectively. the urinary recovery rates of the drug in the first 8 hours after administration were 15.0-96.0% (mean 53.7 +/- 4.9%) and 29.9-73.3% (mean 62.4 +/- 9.4%) in the neonates and in the infants, respectively. 2. fmox was administered to 78 neonates (durations of pregnancy 31-42 weeks, weights at birth 1,420-3,860 g) in whom bacterial infections were established or suspected,  and clinical, bacteriological, and side effects were evaluated. in 47 neonates examined (1 with sepsis, 3 with acute upper respiratory infections, 18 with acute pneumonia, 1 with umbilical infection, 1 with impetigo, 4 with acute urinary tract infections, 1 with acute otitis externa, 1 with periproctal abscess, and 17 with intrauterine infections), the treatment was markedly effective in 41, and effective in 6, with an overall efficacy rate of 100%. the bacterilogical effects of the drug on 3 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 1 strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain of streptococcus agalactiae, 9 strains of escherichia coli,  and 2 strains of haemophilus influenzae which were responsible for these infections were all rated as "eradicated". moreover, the drug, administered with  or without prophylactic intentions showed complete prophylactic effects in all 27 cases tested. no side effects were observed in any of the patients. concerning abnormal clinical laboratory results, increases in got were noted in 2, eosinophilia in 1, and thrombocytosis in 1, but these abnormalities were invariably mild and the normalized in 1 patient without treatment. the results suggest that fmox is useful and safe also in neonates.

TI  == direct identification of bacterial isolates in blood cultures by using a dna probe.
AB  == this study involved the rapid, direct identification of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus  sp., and streptococcus agalactiae from positive blood culture bottles (bactec, johnston laboratories, inc.) by using the accuprobe (gen-probe, san diego, calif.) culture confirmation test. this method uses a chemiluminescent dna probe  that detects the rrna of the target organisms. the manufacturer's instructions were modified to use a pellet of bacteria made directly from positive blood culture broth rather than a colony from an agar plate. two separate procedures of selective centrifugation were employed in order to obtain the pellet. the first utilized a routine clinical centrifuge and a large volume of broth (10 to 12 ml)  from the blood culture bottle. the second method used a microcentrifuge and less  volume (1 to 1.5 ml). a total of 196 clinical specimens taken directly from positive blood culture broths were correctly identified by accuprobe from pellets made by using the clinical centrifuge technique, while 166 clinical specimens used as negative controls failed to show hybridization. the microcentrifuge technique for obtaining pellets was performed on 105 patient specimens, and all were correctly identified. when combined with the microcentrifuge technique for pellet preparation, the accuprobe test has several advantages: (i) direct identification of bacteria from blood culture broths, (ii) rapid turn-around time (30 min), (iii) simplicity of the procedure, and (iv) relative low cost.

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  == cefpirome (hr 810, cpr), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its experimental and clinical studies in pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. plasma and urinary levels of cpr were determined in 2 children (age 5 and 7 years) after the one shot intravenous injection of the drug at 20 mg/kg. average plasma levels of the drug were 44.7 micrograms/ml, 28.5 micrograms/ml, 10.5 micrograms/ml, 4.6 micrograms/ml and 1.5 micrograms/ml at 1/2 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours, respectively, and the average half life was 1.57 hours. average urinary levels of the drug were 1,785 micrograms/ml, 545 micrograms/ml and 198 micrograms/ml at 0-2 hours, 2-4 hours, 4-6 hours, respectively and the average urinary elimination rate was 52.0%. the results were nearly equivalent to those in adults except for urinary elimination rate which tended to be slightly lower than that in adults. 2. cerebrospinal fluid levels in 3 cases of purulent meningitis treated with cpr were investigated. cerebrospinal  fluid levels in a case of neisseria meningitidis were 11.5-23.1 micrograms/ml at  1 hour and 0.94 microgram/ml at 5 hours after intravenous injection of 44.4 mg/kg, 4 times a day. cerebrospinal fluid levels in a case of streptococcus pneumoniae were 1.01-4.23 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after intravenous injection of  49.0 mg/kg, 6 times a day, and in the other case with streptococcus pneumoniae, the levels were 16.8-37.1 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 11.3 and 3.60 micrograms/ml at 3 and 4 hours after intravenous injection 52.2 mg/kg, 6 times a day. these results are not inferior to those with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. these levels appear to be higher than mic90 values against escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae which are the major pathogens of these diseases. 3. cpr was given to 62 patients and clinical efficacy, bacteriological response and adverse reactions were evaluated. evaluated cases for clinical efficacy included 3 cases of purulent meningitis, 1 case of acute purulent otitis media, 2 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 1 case of acute bronchitis, 49 cases of acute pneumoniae, 1 case of scarlet fever, 1 case of acute osteomyelitis, 1 case of acute enterocolitis, and 2 cases of acute uti, totalling 61 cases. clinical efficacies were excellent in 38 cases, good in 22 cases and fair in 1 case with an efficacy rete of 98.4% (excellent + good).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == a survey of purulent meningitis in infancy and childhood from 1980 through 1986 was made by sending questionnaires to 32 pediatric institutions in aichi, gifu and shizuoka prefectures. case cards of 125 patients were collected and analyzed. the results are summarized as follows: 1. the sex ratio (male/female) was 1.78. the age distribution for all patients was as follows: younger than 1 month, 24.8%; 1-12 months, 32.8%; 1 year, 19.2%; 2-5 years, 16.0%; older than 6 years, 7.2%. nearly 3/4 of all purulent meningitis cases occurred in infancy. 2. the isolation rate of causative organisms was 71.2%. the 4 major causative organisms  were haemophilus sp. (28 cases), streptococcus pneumoniae (14 cases), streptococcus agalactiae (13 cases), and escherichia coli (12 cases). haemophilus sp. was dominant in patients over 3 months of age, and s. pneumoniae was noted in all age groups. the latter 2 were dominant under 3 months of age. 3. the outcome  of 125 cases was as follows: cured, 73 cases (58.4%); improved, 26 cases (20.8%); dead, 15 cases (12.0%); unknown, 11 cases (8.8%). as to the outcome by age, the mortality of infants within 1 month old was the highest, 29.0%, and then decreased with increasing age. as to the outcome by causative organisms, haemophilus sp. and e. coli were associated with good outcome, whereas s. pneumoniae and s. agalactiae with poor outcome. 4. among several antibiotics, ampicillin was the most frequently used in 94 cases, followed by cefotaxime in 50 cases. 5. as to the initial antibiotic treatment, 51 cases were treated with penicillins (pcs) (including pcs + aminoglycosides (ags], 9 cases with cephalosporins group i, ii, iv, (ceps i, ii, iv) (including ceps i, ii, iv + ags), 25 cases with ceps v (including ceps v + ags) and 31 cases with ceps v + pcs (including ceps v + pcs + ags). no significant differences were observed in the outcome among these initial treatment group. 6. compared with the initial treatments of ceps v or ceps v + pcs groups, other antibiotics were used more frequently in those of pcs + ags and ceps i, ii, iv groups. in the light of this  analysis, the initial treatments of purulent meningitis with pcs + ags or ceps i, ii, iv were not so effective as those with ceps v or ceps v + pcs.

AB  == in the period of january 1987 to march 1988 15,800 quarter milk samples of dairy  cows from problem herds in lower austria were collected and 744 streptococci strains isolated. for the classification of those 744 isolates a comparative evaluation was carried out by means of the auto-microbic-system (ams), api 20 strep and camp-test. with the ams, 360 (= 48.4%) of the 744 isolates examined could be identified as streptococci and classified as follows: 16 sc. agalactiae; 205 enterococci (101 sc. faecalis, 92 sc. faecium, 12 sc. avium); 74 sc. uberis;  61 sc. of the viridans streptococci and 4 sc. pneumoniae. the test systems showed a correlation of 91.6%. ams and api 20 strep could classify 4 camp-negative streptococci strains to sc. agalactiae. based on these examinations the ams can be recommended for the identification and classification of mastitis streptococci. it can be concluded that ams is simple to use due to the automatic  cycle, and is time saving because results can be obtained between 5 to 6 hours. on the other hand, ams requires expensive equipment.

TI  == the relationship of tonsil bacterial concentration to surface and core cultures in chronic tonsillar disease in children.
AB  == fifty-five tonsils removed for chronic tonsillar disease (chronic tonsillitis and obstructive tonsillar hyperplasia) underwent surface swab and quantitative core cultures in order to identify the relationship between core bacterial concentration and the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsil surface. the accuracy of a single core culture was further established by quantitative cultures of 9 sections per tonsil in an additional 19 tonsils. the results indicate that many (61.5%) but not all aerobic bacteria which were found in the tonsil core were cultured from the surface of the tonsil. conversely, the tonsil  core bacteria with the highest bacterial concentrations are more likely to be present on the tonsillar surface and the greater the bacterial concentration, the more likely the bacteria are to be found in most if not all areas of the tonsil core. therefore, the core bacterial concentration appears to be related to the presence of aerobic bacteria on the tonsillar surface. surface bacteria may not,  however, be truly representative of the core bacterial environment. implications  for the management of chronic tonsillar disease will be discussed.

TI  == comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  == thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (uti) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower uti) or a 14 day (upper uti) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper uti. overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. the infecting organisms were: escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), citrobacter freundii (three), klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter agglomerans, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis (one of each). all of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. the effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. the cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively.  there were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. in the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. one of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. in this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic uti.

TI  == therapeutic studies of cefepime (bmy 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
AB  == cefepime (bmy 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. mice  were infected intracranially with streptococcus pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with haemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, and s. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with s. agalactiae. cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and e. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa meningitis. cefepime was found to be the most active compound against s. pneumoniae and s. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. against h. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. ceftazidime was the least active compound. the pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.

TI  == sensorineural hearing loss in children recovered from purulent meningitis: a study in thai children at ramathibodi hospital.
AB  == hearing loss is one of the serious complications of bacterial meningitis. conventional audiometry and auditory brainstem response (abr) methods were used to detect this complication in eighteen children who recovered from bacterial meningitis treated at ramathibodi hospital from january 1983 to december 1987. six patients (33%) were found to have persistent bilateral sensorineural hearing  loss. among them, the causes of meningitis were: hemophilus influenzae (3 patients), streptococcus pneumoniae (1 patient), streptococcus agalactiae (1 patient) and escherichia coli (1 patient). various clinical and demographic factors were examined in relation to the hearing loss, but no significant correlation was observed. since meningitis often affects small children and makes conventional audiometry tests difficult, abr was found to be a more effective method for testing this group of patients.

TI  == polyvalent group b streptococcal immune globulin for intravenous administration:  overview.
AB  == immunoglobulin therapy is becoming an important modality for the prevention and treatment of bacterial and viral infection. standard intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) is made from large pools of plasma obtained from normal blood donors. however, lot-to-lot variation in titers of antibody to specific microbial pathogens may diminish therapeutic efficacy. since group b streptococcus (gbs) is an important neonatal pathogen, a preparation with high titers of activity against gbs was prepared and studied. plasma was obtained from volunteers immunized with a polyvalent gbs vaccine and was processed by the swiss red cross  for intravenous infusion. this high-titered gbs intravenous immunoglobulin (gbs-ivig) was shown to be superior both in vitro and in vivo to standard ivig. gbs-ivig provided protection when therapy was delayed for up to 24 hours after infection. standard ivig did not protect animals against all gbs strains. however, gbs-ivig enhanced survival from infection with all strains tested, even  when the challenge dose of gbs was increased by 2 log units. specific hyperimmune globulins to pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae have also been studied. immunization of adult volunteers as a means of obtaining hyperimmune globulin appears to be an effective method of producing high-titered pathogen-specific preparations of ivig.

TI  == short course single daily ceftriaxone monotherapy for acute bacterial meningitis  in children: results of a swiss multicenter study. part ii: bacteriological results.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, ampicillin and chloramphenicol was studied  at a reference laboratory against the isolates of the first 33 patients enrolled  in a pediatric swiss multicenter meningitis study. the predictive value of the mic data of 31 of the strains was further corroborated by two sets of bacterial killing curves in broth supplemented with 2 g/l of albumin. ceftriaxone had the lowest geometric mean mic values against all groups of isolates except for ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae. the bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone and that of ampicillin, alone and in combination with chloramphenicol, was compared at six times the respective mics and at pharmacologically readily achievable concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. the bactericidal power of ceftriaxone at six times the mic was as good or better than that of ampicillin alone or in combination against neisseria meningitidis and streptococcus pneumoniae despite the very low drug concentrations of ceftriaxone  compared to that of the competitors; and it was barely lower at six times the mic and at 1 mg/l (a level that is readily surpassed in csf at the 24 h trough level  after a single daily dose of ceftriaxone of 100 mg/kg (neonates 50 mg/kg) than that of ampicillin and chloramphenicol at much higher concentrations against haemophilus influenzae type b.

TI  == presence of chromosomal elements resembling the composite structure tn3701 in streptococci.
AB  == tn3701, carried by streptococcus pyogenes a454, is the first chromosomal composite element to be described; it contains in its central region tn3703, a transposon similar to tn916. a comparison by dna-dna hybridization of tn3701 with omega(cat-tet) and tn3951, carried by streptococcus pneumoniae bm6001 and by streptococcus agalactiae b109, respectively, revealed that the two latter structures are also tn3701-like composite elements. the dnas of 27 other antibiotic-resistant group a, b, c, and g streptococci and of s. pneumoniae bm4200 showed sequence homologies to tn3701 (14 strains, including bm4200), to the regions of tn3701 outside of tn3703 (5 strains), and to tn916 alone (8 strains). the dnas of five strains did not detectably hybridize with any probe. the tetm gene was identified in most chromosomal genetic elements coding for tetracycline-minocycline resistance. since tn3701-like elements are widely disseminated among antibiotic-resistant streptococci (47% of the 34 strains studied), we propose that tn3701 be considered the prototype of chromosomal composite elements.

TI  == new receptor for human plasminogen on gram positive cocci.
AB  == 180 bacterial strains representing 17 different species of gram positive cocci were tested for the ability to interact with human plasminogen. receptors for plasminogen could be detected on 23/24 strains of s. pyogenes, 15/15 strains of s. equisimilis, 14/16 strains of human group g streptococci and 14/14 strains of  s. pneumoniae. eight of nineteen strains representing five species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were also positive. s. equisimilis demonstrated the  highest uptake with a median value of 58 per cent (20%-67%). on the other hand, all strains of s. agalactiae, the majority of s. faecalis and all s. aureus, s. epidermidis and s. saprophyticus strains tested were negative. the concentration  of unlabelled plasminogen causing a 50 per cent reduction of bound tracer was between 50 and 150 mm. these estimates of the dissociation constant confirmed the specific nature of the interaction. binding of plasminogen could be blocked by addition of plasmin-aprotinin complex, suggesting that plasminogen and plasmin bind to the same receptor. binding was also blocked by the plasminogen fragment kringle 1-3, but not by miniplasminogen, a fragment containing kringle 5 and the  b-chain region. as streptokinase interacts mainly with the b-chain of plasmin it  is clear that the bacterial receptor for plasminogen is not identical to streptokinase.

TI  == definition of a bacterial virulence factor: sialylation of the group b streptococcal capsule.
AB  == sialylation of bacterial capsules has been proposed as an important virulence factor for several species of encapsulated pathogens, including group b streptococcus. we have constructed a transposon mutant strain of type iii group b streptococcus that expresses a capsular polysaccharide differing from the wild type only in that the mutant strain's capsule lacks sialic acid. the mutant polysaccharide is antigenically identical to the capsular polysaccharide of type  14 streptococcus pneumoniae, as predicted by the structures of the type iii group b streptococcus and s. pneumoniae polysaccharides. loss of capsular sialic acid was associated with loss of virulence in the mutant strain in a neonatal rat model of lethal group b streptococcus infection. these studies demonstrate directly that capsular sialic acid is a critical virulence determinant for type iii group b streptococcus and support the general hypothesis that surface sialylation aids pathogenic microorganisms in evading host defenses.

TI  == purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  == extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. by a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. they were named bac-5 and bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. the remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). both bac-5 and bac-7 efficiently kill escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae. they also arrest the growth of enterobacter cloacae (mics, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae (mic, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). finally, bac-7 but not bac-5 has mics of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis. from the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of bac-5 and bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.

AB  == fk482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a c-3 vinyl group. its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime,  and amoxicillin-clavulanate. fk482 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012  micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. it  did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. fk482 inhibited 90% of enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. although 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, and shigella  species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, fk482 was less active than cefixime against citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella, serratia, and providencia species, with mics for many isolates of greater than 8  micrograms/ml. fk482 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. bacteroides and pseudomonas species were resistant. fk482 was not hydrolyzed by the tem-1 and tem-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the proteus vulgaris enzyme. it had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.

AB  == cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of cefteram (cftm) in which aminothiazol was also introduced into the 7 position of cephem nucleus, is  a new oral cephem antibiotic. cftm-pi was absorbed through the intestines and hydrolyzed to cftm by esterases in the intestinal wall and existed in the body fluids as cftm. a tablet form of this drug has been released in japan and now a granular form for pediatric patients has been developed. we have determined mics  of 5 drugs (cftm, cephalexin (cex), cefaclor (ccl), ampicillin (abpc), erythromycin (em], against stock strains and mics of 6 drugs (cftm, cex, ccl, abpc, methicillin, cloxacillin) against fresh strains from patients received to cftm-pi, with an inoculum size of 10(6) cfu/ml. a total of 149 strains included gram-positive cocci i.e. staphylococcus aureus (11), streptococcus pyogenes (85), streptococcus agalactiae (16) and streptococcus pneumoniae (4), and gram-negative rods i.e. haemophilus influenzae (11), bordetella pertussis (11), escherichia coli (9), proteus mirabilis (1) and morganella morganii (1). the granular form of cftm-pi was administered to 9 boys (age: 8 years 3 months approximately 10 years  10 months) to determine serum and urinary concentrations of the drug and its urinary recovery rates using bioassay. doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg were given orally 30 minutes after meal to 3 boys, respectively. urinary concentrations and  its urinary recovery rates of t-2525a, a main metabolite of cftm, were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). to study clinical and bacteriological effects of this drug, a mean daily dose of 3.3 mg/kg divided 3-4  times a day (3 times: 133 cases, 4 times: 9 cases) was administered for 8 days on the average to a total of 142 cases with pharyngitis (22), tonsillitis (12), acute bronchitis (3), pneumonia (11), pleurisy (1), scarlet fever (28), acute purulent otitis media (16), impetigo (13), abscess (2), purulent lymphadenitis (1) and urinary tract infection (33). adverse reactions and abnormal effects on laboratory test values attributable to this drug were studied in patients. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. with regard to gram-positive cocci, mics of cftm against 11 fresh strains of s. aureus ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml except for 1 strain, thus cftm was equally effective to cex, but less active than the other drugs tested.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == group b streptococci inhibit the chemotactic activity of the fifth component of complement.
AB  == infection with group b streptococci (gbs) is associated with a poor acute inflammatory response in which neutrophils fail to localize at the site of invasion. in the present studies, we have examined the effects of group b streptococci on c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. fresh human serum  was activated to form c5a and c5adesarg by incubation with zymosan. the activated serum was then incubated with group b organisms, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. group b organisms caused a dose-dependent decrease in c-dependent chemotactic activity. the degree of inhibition was profound with 1 x 10(9) bacteria/ml (10% of control). experiments indicated that significant chemotactic  factor inactivation occurred within 2 min of exposure to gbs organisms, while maximal inhibition occurred after 30 min incubation. a number of different strains of gbs of types i, ii, and iii possessed inhibitory activity. in contrast, group d streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae failed to inhibit the c-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. group a streptococci that were m protein positive also inactivated c-dependent chemotactic activity in serum, as previously reported. the inhibitory activity of the gbs strains could be abolished by heat or trypsin treatment but not by neuraminidase, pronase, or pepsin. c5a levels in zymosan-activated serum as measured by ria were not decreased after incubation with an inhibitory strain  suggesting that absorption was not involved. sds-page analysis revealed that group b streptococci degrade the c5a molecule, increasing its electrophoretic mobility by removing a fragment with a m.w. of approximately 650 da. thus, one of the reasons for the poor inflammatory response at the site of gbs infection may reside in the ability of these pathogens to inactivate c-derived inflammatory mediators. the gbs c5a-ase activity probably serves as an additional virulence factor for these organisms contributing to the poor inflammatory response characteristic of group b streptococcal infection.

AB  == bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter  calcoaceticus, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (amniostat-flm). all species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. the material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. the possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  == [microbiological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  == rokitamycin (rkm), a newly developed macrolide antibiotic with a 16-membered ring, dissolves well under acidic conditions. it has been improved over other macrolides to minimize individual variations in its absorbability. we measured, using the ga-test, variations in gastric acidities of 43 children with ages between 1 to 14 years, and investigated the relationship between gastric acidities and pharmacokinetic values. also activities (expressed in mics) of antimicrobial agents were studied against clinically isolated 229 bacterial strains using an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. tested organisms included streptococcus pyogenes (77 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (29), streptococcus pneumoniae (2), as gram-positive cocci, and haemophilus influenzae (1), haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), bordetella pertussis (12), salmonella sp. (4) and campylobacter jejuni (103) as gram-negative bacilli. against stock strains of bacteria, mics of 10 drugs (rkm, erythromycin (em), josamycin (jm), midecamycin (mdm), midecamycin acetate (mom), clindamycin (cldm), amoxicillin (ampc), cefaclor (ccl), minocycline, ofloxacin (oflx] were determined. against isolates from patients who underwent treatment with rkm, mics of only 4 drugs (rkm, em, jm, mom) were determined. measurements were made on plasma and urinary concentrations of rkm and its urinary recovery rates after patients including 6 boys with ages between 5 years 1 month and 11 years 6 months were administered with rkm (dry syrup). two groups of 6 boys were administered between meals with rkm at dose levels of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. clinical and bacteriological  effects of rkm were evaluated for 175 patients including 5 cases of pharyngitis,  3 tonsillitis, 32 pneumonia, 17 mycoplasmal pneumonia, 34 atypical pneumonia, 28  streptococcal infections, 29 campylobacter enteritis, 4 salmonella gastroenteritis, and 23 enteritis due to unknown organisms. five drop-out cases were excluded from the evaluations. in the evaluable cases, an average dose level used was 31.8 mg/kg/day, with a daily dose divided into 3 to 4 administrations and with an average treatment duration of 9 days. adverse reactions of rkm and its effects on laboratory test values were investigated in these patients including the drop out cases. obtained results of these studies are summarized below. 1. the ga-test produced ph values indicating that amounts of gastric acid  were mostly either normal or high in 42 of the 43 subjects tested (97.7%), and only one low acid case (2.3%) was observed.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of a rokitamycin syrup in  pediatrics].
AB  == rokitamycin (rkm) dry syrup was administered to a group of pediatric patients. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. of the recent isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, fewer strains were highly resistant to rkm than to josamycin (jm), midecamycin (mdm), erythromycin and lincomycin. also, macrolides  (mls)-resistant strains proved to be susceptible to rkm. 2. recent isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, group g streptococci, s. pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were more susceptible to rkm than to midecamycin acetate and jm. oral administrations of 10-15 mg/kg of the drug were followed by its peak concentrations of 0.07-0.77 micrograms/ml in the blood at 30 minutes in many patients, and by an undetectable level at 6 hours also in many of them. t1/2 values were 1.2-2.6 hours, and first  6-hour urinary excretion rates were 1.26-1.74%. 3. fifty-two patients with acute  upper and lower respiratory tract infections, campylobacter enteritis, etc. were  treated with rkm at about 20-40 mg/kg daily for 4-14 days, with an overall efficacy rate of 88.5%. 4. an eradication rate of 81.4% was achieved for 43 strains of 7 species isolated from the patients. 5. no abnormal laboratory test values were observed after treatment with drug 4 approximately 14 days. a side effect, stomach discomfort, was observed in 1 patient.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

AB  == there are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. the hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report  a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. about 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. the most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus species, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. the most  common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.

TI  == silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  == a blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as x-static) was used in these experiments. this fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. at ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. the rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in x-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of  tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. when bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees c as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for pseudomonas, klebsiella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species. the rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that x-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.

TI  == the aetiology of purulent meningitis in highland children: a bacteriological study.
AB  == of 155 highlands children with purulent culture-positive meningitis studied from  march 1980 to september 1984, 84% were aged twelve months or less and 92% were infected with either haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae or both organisms. other pathogens were neisseria meningitidis (8 isolations), streptococcus pyogenes (2 isolations) and streptococcus agalactiae and klebsiella species (1 of each). among h. influenzae isolates, serotype b strains predominated (83%) and most (96%) belonged to biotype i or ii. infections due to  non-b haemophili included serotype a (9 strains), serotype f (1 strain) and non-serotypable variants (3 strains). of 67 s. pneumoniae strains 22% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.1-1.0  micrograms/ml. the commonest serotypes were types 5 (11 isolates), type 7 (9 isolates) and types 2, 6 and 46 (6 of each). no resistance to chloramphenicol was detected in either h. influenzae or s. pneumoniae and only one of 56 strains of h. influenzae was insensitive to betalactam antibiotics. the known case fatality  rate in this study was 37%. more children with pneumococcal infection died (46%)  than those with haemophilus infection (30%), though the difference was not statistically significant; 79% of all deaths occurred in children aged less than  twelve months. there is an urgent need for h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae vaccines that are effective in young children.

TI  == in vitro growth inhibition of mastitis causing bacteria by phenolics and metal chelators.
AB  == antimicrobial activities of three phenolic compounds and four metal chelators were tested at 0, 250, 500, and 1000 ppm in vitro against four major mastitis-causing bacteria, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. overall, butylated hydroxyanisole and tert-butylhydroquinone showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. these phenolics were bactericidal at 250 to 500 ppm against all four bacteria tested. the butylated hydroxytoluene was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria  but was ineffective against the coliforms. at 250 ppm, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria but much less effective against the gram-negatives. however, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was more growth inhibitory than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid against the gram-negative bacteria and especially against escherichia coli. all other compounds were generally much less effective  or ineffective against all four microorganisms. therefore, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, tert-butylhydroquinone, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid may have  practical implications in the prevention or treatment of bovine mastitis.

TI  == [serologic cross reactions of group b streptococci].
AB  == group b streptococci contain sialic acid in their capsular polysaccharides thus resembling human and vertebrate glycoconjugates which are especially increased in human tumors. sterical and conformational reasons are responsible for the fact, that certain streptococcal antigens do not react with antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, against these carbohydrate structures. the usefulness of lectins in detecting streptococcal antigens is demonstrated with antigalactans. in summary, the relationships between the biochemical structure of streptococcal  antigens on one side and the serological reactivity on the other side are not evident a priori, because there are many cross-reactions which, although being expected, serologically do not take place.

TI  == the detection of streptococcal antigens using monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == recent advances in hybridoma technology have allowed the development of homogeneous immunologic reagents of defined specificity, activity, and reproducibility. during the last few years, the number of monoclonal antibodies directed against bacteria has increased exponentially, and research investigations have focused on the use of monoclonal antibodies for the diagnosis and therapy of infectious diseases. monoclonal antibody technology offers a rapid, specific diagnosis of bacterial infection, long before culture results are available. we have described the use of monoclonal antibodies for the detection of group b streptococcal (gbs) infections in mothers and infants at risk to develop invasive gbs disease. specifically, we have used the anti-gbs monoclonal  antibodies to detect gbs colonization, serotype bacterial isolates in the laboratory, and identify gbs antigens in body fluid specimens. we have also discussed the use of anti-gbs monoclonal antibodies to confer protection against  fatal infection in mice. monoclonal antibodies against group a streptococcus and  streptococcus pneumoniae have also been developed with the potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious and often life-threatening infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. with further refinements in monoclonal antibody technology in the future, streptococcal hybridomas may replace standard culture techniques for bacterial identification in the microbiology laboratory.

TI  == molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b  (mls) in streptococci.
AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

TI  == prospective comparative trial of ceftriaxone vs. conventional therapy for treatment of bacterial meningitis in children.
AB  == fifty children with bacterial meningitis were prospectively evaluated in a randomized comparative trial of twice daily ceftriaxone with conventional ampicillin and chloramphenicol therapy. the groups were comparable in age, sex, days of illness before admission, severity of illness at admission, etiology and  admission cerebrospinal fluid (csf) parameters and bacterial colony counts. the pathogens were haemophilus influenzae type b (34 beta-lactamase-negative, 8 beta-lactamase-positive); streptococcus pneumoniae (4); neisseria meningitidis (3); and streptococcus agalactiae (1). initial csf colony counts ranged from 2.5  x 10(2) to 1 x 10(10) colony-forming units/ml. in 44 children a lumbar puncture was repeated 10.5 to 18 hours after starting treatment; 16 of 24 (67%) ceftriaxone patients and 12 of 20 (60%) conventional therapy patients had sterile cultures. the reduction in the csf bacterial colony counts (6.3 log10 colony-forming units/ml) was similar in both groups. ceftriaxone csf levels ranged from 1.0 to 8.0 micrograms/ml, representing a mean csf penetration of 11.3% (range, 3.0 to 24.5%) of the simultaneous serum concentration. the median ceftriaxone bactericidal titer in csf was 1:1024 compared with 1:4 achieved with  conventional therapy. there were no significant differences in clinical responses or in frequency of complications, except for diarrhea which occurred in 59% of the ceftriaxone group and in 22% of the other (p less than 0.01). despite one h.  influenzae type b relapse occurring in the ceftriaxone group, ceftriaxone appears to be safe and as effective as conventional therapy for bacterial meningitis in children older than 2 months of age.

TI  == [evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the atp-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  == bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in atp content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. the results obtained were as follows: the bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the atp-bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by cfu assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming  and more simple than other methods. using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. the serum suppressed the growth rate of e. coli, str.  fecalis, cbs, kleb. pneumoniae and staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. the anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional disc method. thus the sensitivity test  under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. these results suggest the usefulness of atp-bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.

AB  == the relationship between significant bacteriuria (sb), i.e. 2 subsequent voided urine specimens with greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and the occurrence of bacteria in the urinary bladder detected by bladder punction, was investigated in asymptomatic pregnant women. from 30 (70%)  of the 43 women with sb studied, bacteria were isolated from the urinary bladder. the same bacteria were found in the bladders of all 21 women with escherichia coli, the one with klebsiella pneumoniae, and the one with staphylococcus saprophyticus in midstream urine. six of 10 patients with group b streptococci (gbs), 1 of 4 patients with streptococcus faecalis, and none of 5 patients with staphylococcus epidermidis in voided specimens had bacteria in the aspirated urine. serotype iii was isolated from 8/10 patients with sb caused by gbs. one child born to a woman with gbs sb but no bacteria in the urinary bladder, got early onset septicaemia. the poor predictive value of sb with gbs, s. faecalis and s. epidermidis necessitates the increased use of bladder puncture for diagnosis of true asymptomatic bacteriuria (ab), i.e. ab with bacteria in the urinary bladder. sb with gbs even without bacteria in the urinary bladder, may constitute a threat to the baby's health.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == immediate postmortem cultures in an intensive care nursery.
AB  == the results of several published studies suggest that bacterial infection plays an important role in the mortality of neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) patients. to evaluate more thoroughly this role we have routinely performed postmortem cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid on all infants who die in our nicu. during a 5-year review period 25.9% of infants who died had one or both cultures positive for an organism considered to be pathogenic in the neonate. the organisms most commonly cultured were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and group b streptococcus. of those infants who had positive postmortem cultures and  who had an autopsy, 95% had histologic evidence of infection. forty-three percent of our infants with positive postmortem cultures were not suspected of having a serious infection and had not received antibiotics before death. postmortem cultures appeared to be helpful in identifying nicu patients in whom serious infection may have played a role in mortality. unsuspected serious infection is a common finding in infants who die in a neonatal intensive care setting.

AB  == the practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sxt) for the selective isolation of streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and group d enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of sxt at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. for group d enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to  the thymidine concentration. in contrast, the four viridans species studied (streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis ii) and streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. for selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency  are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.

AB  == the group b streptococci (gbs) are known to have type-specific polysaccharides rich in n-acetylneuraminic acid end groups, which are thought to be important immunological determinants. wheat germ agglutinin (wga) has affinity for n-acetylneuraminic acid as well as n-acetylglucosamine, and readily precipitates  the type but not the group polysaccharide. a wga-sepharose affinity column was used to isolate complete type polysaccharides of representative strains of the 4  major gbs types. wga, other lectins, and rabbit antisera were then used to characterize the products of various extraction procedures and chemical degradations, including mild acid hydrolysis and treatment with neuraminidase. results of lectin binding studies were consistent with proposed chemical structures of types ia, ib and ii. differences were noted, however, between the cross-reactive antigens of pneumococcus type 14 and the desialated gbs type iii polysaccharide. although structurally similar, indirect evidence from lectin binding studies suggest that these antigens may not be identical.

TI  == evaluation of rapid identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures by use of the automicrobic system gram-positive identification card.
AB  == because rapid identification of gram-positive organisms from blood cultures may provide valuable information for patient care and because the automicrobic system gram-positive identification (ams-gpi) card (vitek systems, inc., hazelwood, mo.) is designed for the identification of these organisms in 4 to 13 h, we designed this study to evaluate the performance of the ams-gpi card in the direct identification of gram-positive organisms upon detection of growth in blood culture bottles. we compared direct identification by the ams-gpi card with the final ams-gpi card identification and with our standard identification methods. we evaluated 51 gram-positive organisms from clinical blood cultures as well as 49 simulated blood cultures. the isolates included streptococcus pneumoniae (17), streptococcus pyogenes (13), group d enterococci (12), streptococcus agalactiae (11), viridans streptococci (10), coagulase-negative staphylococci (21), staphylococcus aureus (15), and listeria monocytogenes (1). the ams-gpi card identified all of the group d enterococci, viridans streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and all but one each of the streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae isolates. l. monocytogenes was also correctly identified. however, the ams-gpi card identified only 12 of 17 streptococcus pneumoniae and 9 of 15 staphylococcus aureus isolates by direct inoculation. we therefore conclude that the results of direct identification of gram-positive organisms by the ams-gpi card may be used cautiously for rapid direct identification of gram-positive organisms from positive blood cultures.

AB  == urine specimens were obtained from 312 obstetric outpatients by sterile midstream technique and aliquots placed in both becton-dickinson urine culture tubes and sterile conventional tubes. quantitative cultures were made from each tube, and each tube was screened for bacteria with the abbott ms-2 urine screening system.  the time required to detect bacteriuria was recorded for both specimens. isolates from specimens containing greater than or equal to 50,000/ml gram-positive cocci  or greater than or equal to 100,000/ml gram-negative bacilli were identified and  antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. delayed (24 hr) quantitative cultures were done from becton-dickinson tubes. by these criteria, 124 urine specimens were positive in both conventional and becton-dickinson tubes. escherichia coli (n = 72), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), proteus mirabilis (n = 4), group b streptococcus (n = 12), and enterococcus (n = 8) were isolated. time for detection of positive urine samples  was similar in both types of tubes. delayed cultures had significant numbers of false-positive results. antimicrobial susceptibility results did not appear to be influenced greatly by becton-dickinson tube transport. the ms-2 cannot adequately discriminate cultures containing less than 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of urine. the becton-dickinson tube appears to be compatible for use with the ms-2 for purposes of screening for bacteriuria.

TI  == an evaluation of latex particle agglutination to detect antigenemia in children.
AB  == latex particle agglutination (lpa) was used to detect specific bacterial capsular antigen in sera collected at the time blood samples were taken from children with suspected bacteremia. capsular polysaccharide antigens tested for were haemophilus influenzae type b (hi b), streptococcus pneumoniae (sp), streptococcus agalactiae (sa) and neisseria meningitidis (nm) groups a and c. an  adequate volume of serum was available for 1085 of the blood culture sets received. antigenemia was detected in 47 children; 36 children from whom the homologous microorganism was isolated from the associated blood culture and 11 children who had prior antibiotic therapy and whose blood culture grew no microorganism. antigenemia was not detected in 46 children whose blood culture yielded a bacterium for which a homologous lpa reagent was available. fifty children had positive blood cultures with microorganisms considered significant to which no lpa reagent was available. lpa was of value as a rapid diagnostic test in the identification of the etiological agent in severe infectious disease  in children.

TI  == quantitation of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid and blood of children with meningitis and its diagnostic significance.
AB  == cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens from pediatric patients with meningitis were  examined for their concentration of microbes and the relationship of this count to the bacteremia levels, microscopy results, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte concentration. a total of 2,031 consecutive csf specimens were analyzed, of which 63 (3.1%) were positive by culture from the same number of patients. we observed  that 85% of the total csf specimens positive for haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis had counts in excess of 10(3) cfu/ml, with 56% of the specimens exceeding 10(5) cfu/ml. a correlation existed between the number of organisms present in the csf  and blood. for example, from a total of 22 patients who had counts of h. influenzae greater than 10(3) cfu/ml in the csf, 16 or 73% had levels of bacteremia greater than 10(3) cfu/ml. it was also noted that the bacterial concentration had a profound effect on the sensitivity of microscopy. the percentage of positive results increased from 25% with less than or equal to 10(3) cfu/ml to 60% in the range of greater than 10(3) to 10(5) cfu/ml and to 97% at concentrations of greater than 10(5) cfu/ml. furthermore, a significant correlation (p less than 0.01) was noted between the concentration of bacteria in the csf and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes observed on microscopy.

TI  == identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  == penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 5 of streptococcus faecium atcc 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). pbps with similar properties are carried by strains of streptococcus durans, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups a, b, c, and g streptococci or streptococcus pneumoniae. the strains carrying the slow-reacting pbp demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was  several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from s. faecium atcc 9790. they all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting pbp produced. mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of s. durans, s.  faecalis, and s. faecium. all of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting pbp than that carried by the parent. finally, it was found that resistant s. faecium atcc 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all pbps except pbp 5. cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting pbp by 90%. this penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.

TI  == association of bacterial carbohydrate-specific cold agglutinin antibody production with immunization by group c, group b type iii, and streptococcus pneumoniae type xiv streptococcal vaccines.
AB  == rabbits immunized with group b type iii, group c, and streptococcus pneumoniae type xiv streptococcal vaccines developed autoantibodies reactive with autologous and isologous erythrocytes and human o-positive erythrocytes at reduced temperatures. the cold agglutinin antibodies were present in both the immunoglobulin m (igm) and igg fractions of group c streptococcal antiserum and in the igm fraction of group b type iii and s. pneumoniae type xiv antisera. balb/c, cf1, and local strains of mice immunized with group b type iii and s. pneumoniae type xiv streptococcal vaccines also produced a cold agglutinin antibody reactive with rabbit and human erythrocytes. the cold agglutinin antibodies were reactive with saccharide compounds representative of the determinants present on the individual bacterial carbohydrate structures, individual vaccine preparations, and isolated polysaccharides. the group c antibodies in rabbits were reactive with sugar ligands in the following order: n-acetylgalactosamine greater than melibiose greater than lactose greater than galactose greater than glucose. group b type iii and s. pneumoniae type xiv cold  agglutinin antibodies in rabbit antisera, however, displayed reactivities different from group c antibodies and from each other. group b type iii antibodies reacted with galactose greater than lactose greater than n-acetylgalactosamine greater than glucose greater than rhamnose; s. pneumoniae type xiv antibodies reacted with lactose greater than melibiose greater than galactose greater than glucose greater than n-acetylgalactosamine. the same relative ligand specificity was observed for the cold agglutinin antibodies in s. pneumoniae type xiv mouse antisera. the cold agglutinin antibodies in group b type iii and s. pneumoniae type xiv antiserum reacted with erythrocytes at higher temperatures (up to 31 degrees c) than did group c antibodies (up to 14 degrees c). in addition, s. pneumoniae type xiv antibodies did not discriminate between i- or i-bearing human erythrocytes to a significant extent. the results obtained  provide substantial evidence that autoreactive cold agglutinin antibodies produced by immunization with these vaccines represent subpopulations of bacterial carbohydrate-specific antibodies that cross-react with mammalian carbohydrate structures.

TI  == gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  == pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. we studied whether other gram-positive species (groups a and b streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. in vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18%  for the control). infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate c5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. these alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.

TI  == heterogeneity of tetracycline resistance determinants in streptococcus.

TI  == type iii group b streptococcal strain differences in susceptibility to opsonization with human serum.
AB  == human serum opsonins to type iii group b streptococci (gbs) were studied in an in vitro opsonophagocytic assay. two type iii gbs test strains were susceptible (893 and iiinor) and two resistant (891 and 892) to opsonization by the majority of sera from 15 healthy adults. four individuals with undetectable or low opsonic titers to the test strains were immunized with pneumococcal vaccine; immunization with pneumococcal vaccine induced a titer rise in all but one instance when susceptible gbs strains were tested. in contrast, only a single titer rise was detected when resistant gbs strains were employed in the test. these results indicate that immunization with a cross-reacting antigen (identical to core antigen of type iii gbs) fails to induce opsonic antibody to all strains of type  iii gbs. a resistant strain was made highly susceptible to neutrophil killing in  vitro by exposure to neuramindase prior to incubation with opsonic serum. using a fluorescent lectin-binding assay, this enzyme appeared to remove surface sialic acid, suggesting that sialic acid is an antiphagocytic factor. however, the possibility that other surface moieties may act as antiphagocytic factors cannot  be ruled out. both opsonic susceptible and resistant strains absorbed opsonic antibody from serum, which suggests that the gbs antiphagocytic factors do not prevent binding of antibody to resistant bacteria. these findings indicate that demonstration of serum opsonic activity to one strain of type iii gbs may not accurately depict opsonic activity to other strains. in addition, immunization with core antigen did not enhance opsonic activity against all gbs strains. these data also point out the need to use assays which measure functional antibody, since demonstration of antibody binding may not reflect its ability to facilitate bacterial phagocytosis and killing.

AB  == during a 4-year period, 48 obstetric patients with aerobic streptococcal bacteremia were identified. the isolates were group b (31); group d, enterococci  (5); group a (4); group d, not enterococci (3); streptococcus pneumoniae (3); and viridans streptococci (2). the most common diagnoses were endometritis (36) and chorioamnionitis (8). for all streptococcal genital infections, the clinical presentation included early-onset fever, often with few localizing signs. only one patient had a chronic debilitating disease. there was an excellent correlation between genital and bloodstream isolates (36 of 42). maternal response to therapy was good, with no deaths nor episodes of septic shock. possible infectious complications developed in two fetuses and four neonates. the microbiologic and clinical features of aerobic streptococci were reviewed, and the outcome in obstetric patients and that in other adults were compared.

TI  == minimum number of bacteria needed for antigen detection by counterimmunoelectrophoresis: in vivo and in vitro studies.
AB  == threshold concentrations of streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, haemophilus influenzae type b, and streptococcus sp. group b type ib required for positive counterimmunoelectrophoresis reactions were determined in vivo and in vitro. animals were infected intraperitoneally with various concentrations of microorganisms: adult mice with s. pneumoniae, suckling rats with h. influenzae,  and 3-week-old mice with streptococcus sp. group b. at 24 h after infection a minimum blood concentration of 10(3) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml was needed for s. pneumoniae or h. influenzae before antigen was detected in the serum. a minimum concentration of 10(6) cfu/ml was needed for streptococcus sp. group b at 10 h after infection. larger threshold concentrations (10(4) cfu/ml for s. pneumoniae, 10(5) cfu/ml for h. influenzae, and 10(7) cfu/ml for streptococcus) were required in broth-grown cultures before cell-free antigens could be demonstrated by counterimmunoelectrophoresis in the medium. marked levels of antigen release by group b streptococci were observed as the cultures entered early stationary phase. this study provides evidence of a long-accepted, though poorly substantiated, hypothesis that a threshold concentration of microorganism  is necessary before counterimmunoelectrophoresis reactions become positive. counterimmunoelecrophoresis results for clinical specimens should be interpreted  cautiously in light of this evidence.

AB  == the effect of pneumococcal vaccination on antibodies to streptococcus pneumoniae  type 14, group b streptococcus type iii, and ab blood group antigens was studied  in 40 vaccinated adults. fourfold or greater increases in type-specific igg antibody to pn-14 were found in 26 of 40 vaccines (mean increase 6.4-fold) and against gbs-iii in 16 of the 40 (mean increase 2.9-fold) by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. however, only six of the 26 vaccinees with low levels (titers less than or equal to 20) of gbs-iii antibody in prevaccination sera developed titers greater than 20 after vaccination. thus, vaccination with polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine does not reliably induce high levels of if antibody to gbs-iii. fourfold or greater increases in igg isohemagglutinins against blood group a cells were also found in 22 of 27 vaccines (mean increase 4.5-fold) and against blood group b cells in nine of 34 (mean increase 1.7-fold)  using the indirect anti-human globulin test. chromatographic fractionation of selected sera confirmed that the anti-a isohemagglutinins stimulated in group o subjects were of the igg class. thus, pneumococcal vaccination during incompatible pregnancy could potentiate ao hemolytic disease of the newborn infant.

AB  == we studied the influence of preimmunization antibody level on the immune response of adults to one of two structurally related yet immunologically distinct type-specific polysaccharides from type iii group b streptococcus and type 14 pneumonococcus. four weeks after immunization with multivalent pneumococcal vaccine, 20 subjects with low levels of antibody to type iii group b streptococcus antigen had no significant increase in antibody to this antigen (p  greater than 0.05), but all volunteers with moderate to high preimmunization antibody levels who were immunized with pneumovax had significant increases (p less than 0.01). however, the streptococcal antibody response to pneumococcal type 14 antigen was weaker and briefer than that in 10 adults given type iii group b streptococcus vaccine(p less than 0.05). preimmunization antibody levels  influenced the immune response to a structurally similar polysaccharide antigen,  but specific type iii polysaccharide antigen appeared necessary to induce a primary antibody response in "nonimmune" adults. we conclude that immunization of mothers with pneumococcal vaccine is not likely to prevent neonatal type iii group b streptococcal infection, despite immunologic similarities between the two organisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

AB  == the activation of the terminal complement components, c3--9, plays an important role in the host's defense against infection. in the present study, the ability of bacteria to activate the third component of complement (c3) in newborn serum was examined. a variety of bacteria were incubated in test sera at 37 degrees c for 30 min and the percent of available c3 that was activated was measured. using one strain of escherchia coli (no. 3), 32% (mean) of the available c3 was activated in sera from 18 newborns, as compared to 85% in sera from their mothers and 79% in sera from 13 normal adults (p less than 0.005). in contrast, using another strain of e. coli (n70), the percent of c3 activated in newborn sera (83%) was the same as in sera from their mothers (81%) or in sera from normal adults (73%). the defective activation of c3 in newborn sera by e. coli was not related to the presence of the k1 antigen. newborn sera were also challenged with other bacterial species and the activation of c3 was deficient when tested with klebsiellae, but not with staphylococci or streptococci. the defect in newborn sera appeared to be due to a deficiency of a serum factor rather than to the presence of an inhibitor.

TI  == immunodeterminant specificity of human immunity to type iii group b streptococcus.
AB  == the type iii polysaccharides of group b streptococcus in its native state chemically consists of glucose, galactose, glucosamine, and sialic acid. the core of this polysaccharide lacks sialic acid and precipitates with type iii antiserum to give a partial identity with the precipitate between the native antigen and this serum. the core determinant is immunochemically similar to the capsular polysaccharide of type xiv streptococcus pneumoniae, while the native type iii group b streptococcal polysaccharide does not cross-react with type xiv pneumococcal antiserum. in human sera, it is antibody directed to the native antigen which correlates very highly with opsonic immunity (r = 0.94) while a poorer correlation exists between antibody to the core antigen and opsonins (r =  0.51 p less than 0.001). in natural infections, as association exists between low levels of maternal antibody to the native antigen and risk of disease in the infant. this association is not true for antibody to the core structure, where both infected infants and their mothers have much higher levels of antibody to the core than the native antigens. infected infants are also more likely to respond to infection by developing antibody to the native antigen. immunization of 12 adults with multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide induced significantly better antibody response to the core antigen than to the native, and this vaccine induced opsonic activity in only one recipient. immunization of adults with type  iii group b streptococcal antigens induced antibody to the native determinant which correlated with opsonic activity. therefore, it would appear that native group b streptococcal polysaccharides will provide the best candidate antigens for immunization.

TI  == demonstration of opsonic activity and in vivo protection against group b streptococci type iii by streptococcus pneumoniae type 14 antisera.
AB  == the present studies demonstrate that antisera directed against streptococcus pneumoniae type 14 is opsonic for group b streptococci type iii in a neutrophile-mediated bactericidal assay. specificity was demonstrated by the observations that group b streptococci type iii and s. pneumoniae type 14 adsorbed the opsonic activity of anti-s. pneumoniae type 14 antisera. group b streptococci strain 090r (devoid of type antigens) and s. pneumoniae type 3, did  not remove the opsonic activity of anti-s. pneumoniae type 14 serum. in vivo studies using a suckling rat model of neonatal group b streptococcal type iii sepsis demonstrated that antisera directed against s. pneumoniae type 14 was highly protective.

TI  == evaluation of the counterimmunoelectrophoretic (cie) procedure in a clinical laboratory setting.
AB  == the counterimmunoelectrophoretic (cie) procedure was evaluated under clinical laboratory conditions to determine its validity and comparability with culture methods. the procedure was further evaluated to determine applicability to a variety of clinical samples. an inexpensive set-up was developed to utilize the cie procedure at bench level. results indicated the procedure to be sensitive in  detecting haemophilus influenzae, type b, and neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), group b. the procedure was more sensitive for detection of h. influenzae, type b, than for meningococcus, group b. the authors have confirmed the usefulness of the cie procedure in the detection of group b streptococci, pneumococci and teichoic acid antibody to staphylococcus aureus. detection of escherichia coli k 1 antigen was also accomplished by cie. in the authors' laboratory the cie procedure was superior to culture methods when used for the detection of h. influenzae, type b, and meningococcus group b.

TI  == bacterial etiology of otitis media during the first six weeks of life.
AB  == tympanocentesis was performed on 70 infants who had otitis media during the first six weeks of life. the bacteria isolated from their middle-ear effusions were streptococcus pneumoniae (13 patients), neisseria catarrhalis (11 patients), hemophilus influenzae (ten patients), enterobacteriaceae (four patients), staphylococcus aureus (four patients), streptococci (groups a and b) (three patients), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (two patients). thirty patients (42.9%) had middle-ear effusions which did not contain pathogenic bacteria. twenty-seven infants were followed for at least 12 months and 12 (44.4%) of these infants had  six or more episodes of otitis media during the observation period. further studies will be needed to establish the significance of middle-ear disease at this age and the role of therapy in improving its outcome.

TI  == ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against klebsiella pneumoniae (p less than .001), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (p less than .001) and aeromonas hydrophilia (p less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for staphylococcus aureus (p less than .001), streptococcus agalactiae (p less than .001), staphylococcus epidermidis (p less than .001) and streptococcus viridans (p less than .005). significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli.

TI  == intramammary infections in a dairy herd with a low incidence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == in a dairy herd with a low incidence of intrammary infections due to streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus, clinical mastitis remained a  serious problem despite good control of nonclinical mastitis through postmilking  teat disinfection and antibiotic therapy of known infected quarters at the end of lactation. during the 2-year study, the incidence of clinical mastitis was 0.88 cases/cow-year; 32.2% were caused by streptococcal species other than str agalactiae and 33.5% by gram-negative organisms. among all new infections detected, 54.1% were caused by streptococcal species other than str agalactiae and 25.7% by gram-negative bacteria. among new infections, 41.6% occurred during  the nonlactating period or within a few days of calving. incidence of clinical mastitis was highest in the 1st month of lactation. among 84 gram-negative infections, 42.8% were caused by klebsiella pneumoniae, 20.2% by escherichia coli, and 23.8% by enterobacter spp. among the many serotypes of k pneumoniae and e coli, none was predominant.

TI  == fiberoptic bronchoscopy and culture bacteria from the lower respiratory.
AB  == forty-five specimens were obtained by sequential translaryngeal aspiration and fiberoptic bronchoscopy from 31 clinically unifected patients with lung cancer in order to evaluate the reliability of routine fiberoptic bronchoscopy for culture  of the lower respiratory tract. bacteria were recovered brom 98 percent (44) of the specimens obtained via fiberoptic bronchoscopy and from 58 percent (26) of the specimens obtained by the preceding translaryngeal aspiration. the microorganisms grown from cultures of specimens obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy consisted of mixtures of both nonpathogenic and potenitally pathogenic bacteria. potentially pathogenic bacteria were present in 87 percent (39) of the specimens from fiberoptic bronchoscopy and 31 percent (14) of specimens from translayngeal aspiration. the results of cultures from the two procedures agreed completely in only a single instance. culture of washings or secretions obtained by routine fiberoptic bronchoscopy is not recommended because it provides inaccurate and clinically confusing information about the presence or types of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract prior to instrumentation.

TI  == [infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with klebsiella mastitis].
AB  == the infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. the following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter  milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from  milk samples 28 and 31 times, pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and escherichia coli twice. the authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); however, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. the final deduction concerning the exogenic character of klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.

TI  == rapid specific identification of group d streptococci by counterimmunoelectrophoresis.
AB  == clinical isolates of group d streptococci have been examined by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (cie) to determine if this method might be of value  in the rapid identification of the members of this group. group d organisms identified by classical biochemical and serologic procedures were inoculated into todd hewitt broth and incubated at 37 degrees c. after 4 hours of incubation, free group d streptococcal antigen was detected in broth cultures from 70 of 70 group d enterococcal strains. precipitin lines were readily visible immediately after electrophoresis in each case. in contrast, 10 nonenterococcal group d strains failed to produce detectable free group d antigen in the todd hewitt broth after 4, 24, or 48 hours incubation. such antigen was detectable, however,  after 48 hours incubation in mueller hinton broth containing 10 grams of glucose  per liter. representative strains of group a, c, g, and b streptococi, streptococcus viridans and streptococcus pneumoniae grown in todd-hewitt broth for 4 hours gave no precipitin lines when reacted against adsorbed monospecific group d antiserum. group d antigen was also detected in broth cultures of direct  swabs and in 18-hour blood culture broths. cie appears to be a rapid and sensitive procedure for identification of the enterococcal strains of group d streptococci from clinical isolates.

TI  == acute severe mastitis in cows of the dutch-friesian breed (author's transl).
AB  == one hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. e. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by st. aureus (19%), c. pyogenes (10%), str. dysgalactiae (9%), str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, aerobacter aerogenes, kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and  p. multocida. in several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. the prognosis will vary with the causative organism. treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.

TI  == concentrations of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == concentrations of bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid ranged from 4.5 x 10(3) to 3 x  10(8) colony-forming units/ml in 27 patients with bacterial meningitis before antibiotic therapy and from 4 x 10(1) to 1.4 x 10(6) cfu/ml in four patients after one to two days of antibiotic therapy. all patients with persistent positive cultures had pretreatment concentrations of 10(7) cfu/ml or greater. a significant association was observed between cerebrospinal fluid lactic acid dehydrogenase activity and concentrations of bacteria (p less than 0.01). large inocula of hemophilus influenzae type b (10(7)) increased the minimal inhibitory  concentration for penicillin and ampicillin but not for chloramphenicol. the minimal inhibitory concentration of each of the three antibiotics increased when  group b streptococci were assayed. these data indicate that persistence of a positive culture may be related to large initial concentrations of bacteria. the  relative "resistance" in vitro of large inocula possibly contributes to this persistence. these observations are also consistent with the hypothesis that lactic acid dehydrogenase activity in cerebrospinal fluid is derived from bacteria.

TI  == [resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections (author's transl)].
AB  == the present status of resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections is reviewed. schematically it can outlined as follows. streptococcus b-haemolyticus as well as pneumococcus did not change their sensitivity to penicillin, but some strains are now resistant to tetracycline. streptococcus viridans, enterococcus and h. influenzae did not change substantially their sensitivity to antibiotics. staphylococcus aureus is the bacterial species that always poses some problems with regard to antibiotic resistance. due to the selection of strains penicillinase-producing because of the large use of penicillin, the most part of clinical isolates of staphylococci  is now resistant to penicillin. in addition an increased number of strains resistant to the other antibiotics has been registered as soon as they has been introduced in therapy. the resistant strains spread in a particularly rapid way in hospital. the introduction in therapy of penicillinase-resistant penicillins constituted a remarkable advance in therapy of staphylococcal infection. however, there is now a growing number of indications about the emergence of methicillin resistant strains of staphylococci. on the other hand it must be recalled that since 1960 a marked reduction of incidence and mortality in severe staphylococcal infections has been noted. incidence and mortality of respiratory infections due  to gram-negative bacilli is augmented particularly in connection with a larger use of immunosuppressive and antineoplastic therapies, of particular surgical or  reanimation procedures, of intensive courses of antibiotic therapy etc. emergence of pseudomonas, proteus, serratia, providencia, etc. infections poses many difficult problems of chemotherapy since these species are scarcely sensitive to  antibiotics. carbenicillin, cephalosporins, sisomicin, tobramycin, amikacin are the more recent drugs that alone or in combination may offer some chances of success in this field.

TI  == meningitis caused by streptococcus in adults.
AB  == meningitis caused by streptococcus is uncommon in adults. otitis media, mastoiditis, sinusitis, or trauma has antedated most cases reported in the past.  data on 10 recent cases suggest changes in the current pathogenesis of streptococcal meningitis in adults and emphasize the importance of accurate streptococcal speciation. endocarditis was present in five cases; trauma played a role in two others. brain abscess, corticosteroids, alcoholic cirrhosis, and peritonitis secondary to chronic peritoneal dialysis were etiologic factors in five patients. otitis media, mastoiditis, and sinusitis were conspicuously absent. streptococcus agalctiae accounted for purulent meningitis in two postmenopausal women. both strains of group b streptococcus were bacitracin-sensitive and were thus mislabeled group a. recognition of streptococcus bovis spared two patients unnecessary aminoglycoside adminstration. nine of the 10 patients survived, including a women with prosthetic mitral valve  endocarditis and a man with a ruptured brain abscess. differentiation of these streptococci from streptococcus pneumoniae was seldon possible on the basis of the spinal fluid gram stain alone.
