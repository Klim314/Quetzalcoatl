TI  - The cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  - Coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the Western diet. Mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. We found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. Bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide. For selected strains pH activity profiles were determined. The culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. Species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: Rothia mucilaginosa HOT-681, Rothia aeria HOT-188, Actinomyces odontolyticus HOT-701, Streptococcus mitis HOT-677, Streptococcus sp. HOT-071, Neisseria mucosa HOT-682 and Capnocytophaga sputigena HOT-775, with Rothia species being active in all four assays. Cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. The approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kD (Rothia spp.), ~60 kD (A. odontolyticus) and ~150 kD (Streptococcus spp.). In conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. A cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Althaea officinalis L. roots, Arnica montana L. flowers, Calendula officinalis L. flowers, Hamamelis virginiana L. leaves, Illicium verum Hook. fruits and Melissa officinalis L. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veilonella parvula, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces odontolyticus. The methanol extracts of H. virginiana and A. montana and, to a lesser extent, A. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (MIC < or = 2048 mg/L) against many of the species tested. In comparison, M. officinalis and C. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (MIC > or = 2048 mg/L) against all the tested species with the exception of Prevotella sp. Illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against E. corrodens. The results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of H. virginiana, A. montana and A. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.
TI  - The effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previously, we reported that SRP resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of Bacteroidesforsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola at 3 and 6 months post-SRP in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects were monitored at 9 and 12 months. Thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of SRP in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. METHOD: Clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to SRP and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. Each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. Differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The Quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. RESULTS: Mean pocket depth (mm+/-SEM) decreased from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). Mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. Bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001, p<0.05, respectively). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and T. denticola decreased in prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels at 9 and 12 months. Significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at 12 months for Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, Streptococcus mitis, Capnocytophaga sp, and Veillonella parvula. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological changes associated with an altered subgingival environment induced by periodontal pocket reduction.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to study the effect of an altered subgingival environment, induced by changing the local soft tissue morphology, i.e., pocket depth reduction, on the subgingival microbiota and the clinical conditions. 7 patients aged 30-60 years with generalized marginal periodontitis were selected. Patients were instructed in proper oral hygiene and all teeth were cleaned supragingivally. Mucoperiosteal flaps were raised and the bone re-contoured to eliminate angular bony defects. While the control teeth were carefully debrided and thoroughly root planed, no root instrumentation was performed on the test teeth. Calculus deposits visible to the naked eye were only chipped-off with the tip of a scaler. The flaps were apically repositioned and sutured at the level of the bone crest. Clinical parameters showed a similar pattern of response in the test and control sites over a one year observation period post therapy. Probing depths and probing attachment levels were significantly reduced one month after surgery and remained at a lower level. A significant decrease was also noted for total anaerobic viable bacterial counts. The proportion of the Gram-negative anaerobic rods decreased significantly in both groups. P. gingivalis, Fusobacterium sp., C rectus were detected significantly less often after treatment in both groups. Capnocytophaga and A. odontolyticus, on the other hand, were more frequently isolated after therapy. These findings corroborate the concept that the reduction of selected subgingival microorganisms is the key element for the success of periodontal therapy, rather than the removal of tooth substance and mineralized deposits by root instrumentation.
TI  - Changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. A 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  - It was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. Between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. During this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. High values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. The frequency of detection of Actinomyces odontolyticus and of Capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. The frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting Bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. However, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting B. intermedius and B. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). A significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of A. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). In girls, a similar increase was obtained for A. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the Tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). The changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.
