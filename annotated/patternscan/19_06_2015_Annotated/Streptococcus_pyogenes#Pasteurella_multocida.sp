TI  == [effects of two udp-glucose dehydrogenases on hyaluronic acid biotransformation].
AB  == we amplified genes encoding udp-glucose dehydrogenase, ecohasb from escherichia coli and spyhasb from streptococcus pyogenes. both ecohasb and spyhasb were inserted into t7 expression vector prx2 to construct recombinant plasmids prxeb and prxsb, and to express in e. coli bl21(de3). after nickel column purification  of udp-glucose dehydrogenases, the enzymes were characterized. the optimum reaction condition of spyhasb was at 30 degrees c and ph 10. the specific activity reached 12.2 u/mg under optimum condition. the optimum reaction condition of ecohasb was at 30 degrees c and ph 9. its specific activity reached  5.55 u/mg under optimum condition. the pmuhasa gene encoding hyaluronic acid synthase was amplified from pasteurella multocida and ligated with ecohasb and spyhasb to construct the coexpression vectors pbpaeb and pbpasb, respectively. the co-expression vectors were transformed into e. coli bw25113. hyaluronic acid  (ha) was produced by biotransformation and the conditions were optimized. when recombinant strains were used to produce hyaluronic acid, the higher the activity of udp-glucose dehydrogenase was, the better its stability was, and the higher the ha production could reach. under the optimal conditions, the yields of ha produced by pbpaeb/bw25113 and pbpasb/bw25113 in shake flasks were 1.52 and 1.70  g/l, respectively, and the production increased more than 2-3 folds as previously reported.

TI  == characterization of a trifunctional glucosyltransferase essential for moraxella catarrhalis lipooligosaccharide assembly.
AB  == the human respiratory tract pathogen moraxella catarrhalis expresses lipooligosaccharides (los), glycolipid surface moieties that are associated with  enhanced colonization and virulence. recent studies have delineated the major steps required for the biosynthesis and assembly of the m. catarrhalis los molecule. we previously demonstrated that the glucosyltransferase enzyme lgt3 is  responsible for the addition of at least one glucose (glc) molecule, at the beta-(1-4) position, to the inner core of the los molecule. our data further suggested a potential multifunctional role for lgt3 in los biosynthesis. the studies reported here demonstrate that the lgt3 enzyme possesses two glycosyltransferase domains (a1 and a2) similar to that of other bifunctional glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in surface polysaccharide biosynthesis in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus pyogenes. each lgt3 domain contains a conserved dxd motif, shown to be involved in the catalytic activity of other glycosyltransferases. to determine the function of each domain, a1 (n-terminal), a2 (c-terminal) and double a1a2 site-directed dad to aaa mutants were constructed and the resulting los phenotypes of these modified strains were  analyzed. our studies indicate that the lgt3 n-terminal a1 catalytic domain is responsible for the addition of the first beta-(1-3) glc to the first glc on the  inner core. the c-terminal catalytic domain a2 then adds the beta-(1-4) glc and the beta-(1-6) glc, confirming the bifunctional nature of this domain. the results from these experiments demonstrate that lgt3 is a novel, multifunctional  transferase responsible for the addition of three glcs with differing linkages onto the inner core of m. catarrhalis los.

TI  == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

TI  == haemophilus parasuis serovars isolated from pathological samples in northern italy.
AB  == from january 2007 to december 2011, a total of 106 haemophilus parasuis strains isolated from pigs were serotyped by agar gel diffusion test (dg). serovar 4 was  the most prevalent (24.5%), followed by serovar 13 (19.8%) and serovar 5 (11.3%). twenty-nine strains were non-typeable (27.3%). the strains were divided into two  groups, depending on whether they were isolated from specific pathological lesions of systemic disease such as polyserositis, arthritis or meningitis (73 cases of 106) or from the lower respiratory tract of pigs suffering from bronchopneumonia (33 cases of 106). serovars 4 and 13 had a higher prevalence in  systemic infection (polyserositis) than in respiratory disease only. pasteurella  multocida (14/106), streptococcus suis (7/106), actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (4/106), bordetella bronchiseptica (3/106) and arcanobacterium pyogenes (3/106) were isolated in association with h. parasuis.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both  swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium  pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9%  of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica  were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from respiratory tract of pigs in  poland between 2004 and 2008.
AB  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from nasal swabs and lungs of pigs, to 16 commonly used antibiotics, was determined by disc diffusion test. beta-lactams showed the best activity against streptococcus suis (s. suis) (> 99% of susceptible strains). the lowest sensitivity of s. suis was evidenced to: tylosin, tetracycline and neomycin (50%, 40% and 25%, respectively). isolates of  escherichia coli (e. coli) demonstrated the highest susceptibility to cephalosporin (85% strains), gentamicin and norfloxacin (over 74%). the lowest susceptibility of e. coli was demonstrated to tiamulin and penicillin (11.3% and  1.9%, respectively). over 80% of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (app) strains were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. the highest resistance of app, but demonstrated by below 20% of tested isolates only, was evidenced to neomycin and  lxs. isolates of pasteurella multocida (pm), haemophilus parasuis (hps) and arcanobacterium pyogenes (a. pyogenes) were highly susceptible to the most antibiotics included in the analysis. the comparison of the in vitro susceptibility of pathogens to the chemotherapeutics used on polish farms for the therapy of bacterial infection of pigs within the last five years and the last 10 years, showed an increasing percent of e. coli and s. suis strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics. it is also shown that pm, hps, app and a. pyogenes isolates were continuously susceptible to the most chemotherapeutics applied.

TI  == management of human and animal bite wound infection: an overview.
AB  == animal and human bite wounds can lead to serious infections. the organisms recovered generally originate from the biter's oral cavity and the victim's skin  flora. anaerobes were isolated from more than two thirds of human and animal bite infections. streptococcus pyogenes is often recovered in human bites, pasteurella multocida in animal bites, eikenella corrodens in animal and human, capnocytophaga spp, neisseria weaveri, weeksella zoohelcum, neisseria canis, staphylococcus intermedius, nonoxidizer-1, and eugonic oxidizer-2 in dog, flavobacterium group in pig, and actinobacillus spp in horse and sheep bites. vibrio spp, plesiomonas shigelloides, aeromonas hydrophila, and pseudomonas spp can cause infections in bites associated with marine settings. in addition to local wound infection, complications include lymphangitis, local abscess, septic  arthritis, tenosynovitis, and osteomyelitis. uncommon complications include endocarditis, meningitis, brain abscess, and sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation especially in immunocompromised individuals. wound management includes administering local care and using proper antimicrobial therapy when needed.

TI  == evaluation of pyelonephritis in culled indoor and outdoor high parity sows.
AB  == the present trial was conducted in hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor  high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. all rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. in outdoor sows escherichia (e.) coli and actinobaculum (a.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. besides e. coli and a. suis, clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (staphylococcus (s.) albus,  s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. were  concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida, proteus spp. were concurrently found beside e. coli and a. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. in indoor sows e. coli and a. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida,  proteus spp. were found beside e. coli and a. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. however only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus  faecalis), staphylococci (s. albus, s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. implications: in eastern european climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.

TI  == the functional molecular mass of the pasteurella hyaluronan synthase is a monomer.
AB  == hyaluronan (ha), a linear polysaccharide composed of beta1,3-glcnac-beta1,4-glcua repeats, is found in the extracellular matrix of vertebrate tissues as well as the capsule of several pathogenic bacteria. all known ha synthases (hass) are dual-action glycosyltransferases that catalyze the addition of two different sugars from udp-linked precursors to the growing ha chain. the bacterial hyaluronan synthase, pmhas from gram-negative pasteurella multocida, is a 972-residue membrane-associated protein. previously, the gram-positive streptococcus pyogenes enzyme, sphas (419 residues), and the vertebrate enzyme, xlhas1 (588 residues), were found to function as monomers of protein, but the pmhas is not similar at the protein sequence level and has quite different enzymological properties. we have utilized radiation inactivation to measure the  target size of recombinant full-length and truncated pmhas. the target size of has activity was confirmed using internal enzyme standards of known molecular weight. we found that the pasteurella ha synthase protein functions catalytically as a monomer. functional truncated soluble pmhas also behaves as a polypeptide monomer as assessed by gel filtration chromatography and light scattering.

TI  == etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of poland.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of poland in years 2003-2005. bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from california mastitis test (cmt) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of api tests (analytical profile index). it was found that 32.7% of samples that were cmt positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) (14.6%), staph. aureus (8.6%), gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among gram-negative bacilli followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), serratia marcescens (3.1%), pasteurella multocida (3.1%), acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria  species. stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), staph. hyicus (12.2%), staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), staph. sciuri (11.6%), staph. chromogenes (8.8%), staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent cns. streptococcus uberis (50%), str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), str. acidominimus (6.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among camp-negative streptococci. an increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, staph. aureus, a. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.

TI  == hyaluronan biosynthesis by class i streptococcal hyaluronan synthases occurs at the reducing end.
AB  == previous studies reached different conclusions about whether class i hyaluronan synthases (hass) elongate hyaluronic acid (ha) by addition to the reducing or the nonreducing end. here we used two strategies to determine the direction of ha synthesis by purified class i hass from streptococcus equisimilis and streptococcus pyogenes. in the first strategy we used each of the two udp-sugar substrates separately to pulse label either the beginning or the end of ha chains. we then quantified the relative rates of radioactive ha degradation by treatment with beta-glycosidases that act at the nonreducing end. the results with both purified hass demonstrated that ha elongation occurred at the reducing  end. in the second strategy, we used purified s. equisimilis has, udp-glucuronic  acid, and udp[beta-32p]-glc-nac to radiolabel nascent ha chains. under conditions of limiting substrate, the 32p-labeled products were separated from the substrates by paper chromatography and identified as ha-[32p]udp saccharides based on their degradation by snake venom phosphodiesterase or hyaluronidase and  by their binding to a specific ha-binding protein. the 32p radioactivity was chased (released) by incubation with unlabeled udp-sugars, showing that the ha-udp linkages turn over during ha biosynthesis. in contrast, ha-[32p]udp products made by the purified class ii pasteurella multocida has were not released by adding unlabeled udp-sugars, consistent with growth at the nonreducing end for this enzyme. the results demonstrate that the streptococcal class i has enzymes polymerize ha chains at the reducing end.

TI  == functional characteristics and catalytic mechanisms of the bacterial hyaluronan synthases.
AB  == the first gene for a glycosaminoglycan synthase to be cloned was the hyaluronan (ha) synthase from s. pyogenes, which we reported in 1993. since then, at least 20 bacterial, viral, or eukaryotic ha synthase gene or cdna sequences and two bacterial chondroitin synthase genes have been reported. during the last decade a great deal has been elucidated about the structure, function, and mechanisms of action of the bacterial ha synthases, which are the focus of this review. very rapid progress has been made in elucidating the mechanism of ha synthesis by the  ha synthase from pasteurella multocida. although little of this information is applicable to understanding the mechanism of action of streptococcal ha synthases, good progress has also been made in understanding how these latter enzymes work.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == skin microflora and bacterial infections of the skin.
AB  == the skin is a milieu for controlled bacterial growth. skin supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria. environmental and local factors, host immunity, and organism adherence and virulence are intricately related to cutaneous infection. resident gram-positive  bacteria include staphylococcus, micrococcus, and corynebacterium sp. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes are notoriously pathogenic in the skin. in order for bacteria to be pathogenic, they must be able to adhere to, grow on, and invade the host. bacteria possess numerous virulence genes that allow for growth in these privileged niches. epidermal infections caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes include impetigo and ecthyma. dermal infections consist of erysipelas, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. the pilosebaceous unit is involved in folliculitis, furunculosis, and carbunculosis. moreover, s. aureus and s. pyogenes produce toxins that may elicit a superantigen response, causing massive release of cytokines. staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever are all superantigen-mediated. gram-negative organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, pasteurella multocida, capnocytophaga canimorsus, bartonella sp., klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, and vibrio vulnificus are not typical resident skin microflora but may cause cutaneous infection.

TI  == induction of parturition with prostaglandin f2 alpha as a possible model to study impaired reproductive performance in the dairy cow.
AB  == parturitions were induced in five cows, 2 weeks before term using prostaglandin (pg) f(2alpha). two i.m. injections were performed with an interval of 24 h. all  cows calved within 5 days (average 2.7 days) after the first injection of pgf(2alpha). out of five cows, four had retained fetal membranes (rfm). each animal was sampled for bacteriological examination using uterine biopsies twice a week during 42 days postpartum (pp). jugular vein blood samples were withdrawn for pgf(2alpha)-metabolite and progesterone analyses five times per day during the first week pp and eight times per 24 h during the 2nd and 3rd weeks pp. from  the 4th week, the sampling interval was reduced back to five times per day. from  the 5th week pp, the sampling was reduced to two times per day and sampling was terminated after day 46 pp. only morning samples were used for progesterone analyses. from day 10 pp, ultrasonography (us) was performed every 3rd day until  day 39 pp for detection of ovarian activity and follicular dynamics. the highest  incidence of bacteriological species was found during the first 3 weeks pp. after the 5th week of collection, all animals were free from bacteria. the species of bacteria found were arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, escherichia coli, alpha-hemolytic streptococcae and pasteurella multocida. immediately after parturition, very high levels of the pg-metabolite were seen in all animals, with a sharp decrease to line of significance around days 9-12 pp. small increases above the line of significance were detected up to day 27 pp in cows with rfm, and after that time the levels were considered to be at baseline. low levels of progesterone were seen in four animals during the whole experimental time. in one animal, an increase was seen on day 43 pp, which was maintained until the end of  the experimental period on day 46 pp. based on us, follicular waves were detected in all animals during the experimental period. in three animals, three non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected and in two animals, four non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected during 39 days of ultrasound sessions. based on progesterone levels, only one animal was considered to have ovulated around day 40 pp. results from the present study indicate that reproductive performance of cows after pg-induced parturitions differs from those of spontaneous cases of rfm. differences regarding the resumption of ovarian activity were also observed between previous studies of dexamethasone-induced parturitions and the present study.

TI  == recent progress in novel macrolides, quinolones, and 2-pyridones to overcome bacterial resistance.
AB  == macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, having good activity against pathogens such as legionella, chlamydia, campylobacter spp, branhamella spp, pasteurella multocida and streptococci, have gained wide acceptance for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as cutaneous infections. emergence of bacterial resistance, particularly in gram-positive bacteria, has been observed. macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and s.  pyogenes are found in france and many other countries, resulting in failure of therapy for pneumonia, pharyngitis, and skin infection. ru 004, hmr 3647, and te  802 were reported to be active against these resistant strains. research at abbott produced several macrolide derivatives in the anhydrolide, tricyclic and tetracyclic ketolides as well as 6-o-alkyl ketolides series having potent activity against macrolide resistant s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae. research on streptogramins to overcome bacterial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has produced interesting compounds. another class of antibacterial agent called quinolones is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. ciprofloxacin, the market leader, however, has low potency against anaerobes. bacterial resistance ( such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus ) to ciprofloxacin is increasing rapidly. many quinolone compounds are being synthesized to address these drawbacks. the new quinolones currently under development are characterized by enhanced activities against streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobes. this presentation reviews the current research in the identification of agents to overcome the macrolide and quinolone resistance.

AB  == on a dairy farm, otitis media was diagnosed in 64 suckler calves (21.8%) during a study period of 2 years, and in 10 calves (3.4%) in the third year. the inflammation was unilateral in 63 and bilateral in 11 calves. the affected calves were dull, lacked appetite, were pyrexic and displayed drooping ear or ears and tilted heads with purulent discharge exuding from the external ear canal. of the  affected animals, 56 (87.5%) were aged between 3 and 8 weeks. morbidity was higher during the calving season and during the autumn and winter months (october-december). pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from 21 (32.8%), p. multocida from 20 (31.2%), actinomyces pyogenes from 11 (17.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae from three (4.7%) of the clinically affected calves only during the first two study years. the exudate of the acute ear infections contained, in addition to pasteurella spp., various bacteria and yeasts. most of these bacteria were isolated from healthy ears as well, and are likely to be part of the normal  ear flora. on the other hand most of the yeasts were isolated from otitic calves. after a short course of an appropriate treatment infections healed in all cases.  possible preventive measures are discussed.

TI  == enzymological characterization of the pasteurella multocida hyaluronic acid synthase.
AB  == hyaluronic acid (ha), a linear polysaccharide composed of alternating glucuronic  acid and n-acetylglucosamine residues, is an essential molecule of higher vertebrates. the fowl cholera pathogen pasteurella multocida carter type a also produces ha in the form of an extracellular capsule in order to evade host defenses. ha synthase activity could be obtained from cell-free membrane preparations of p. multocida. the enzyme utilized udp-sugar precursors of ha in the presence of mg2+ or mn2+ at neutral ph. mn2+ at 1 mm stimulated approximately 2-fold more incorporation than mg2+ at 10 mm. on the other hand, the analogous enzyme from group a streptococcus, hasa, is stimulated more by mg2+ than mn2+. the apparent michaelis constants, k(m), of the p. multocida ha synthase for udp-n-acetylglucosamine and udp-glucuronic acid were estimated to be approximately 75 and approximately 20 microm, respectively, in the presence of mg2+, which suggests that the substrates are bound with 2-3-fold higher affinity  than by the hasa enzyme. the rate enhancement observed with mn2+ is apparently not due to better binding of the sugar nucleotide precursors complexed to mn ion  because the k(m) value, a measure of substrate affinity, increases by 25-50% in comparison to mg2+. in summary, the ha synthase from p. multocida, a gram-negative bacterium, has kinetic optima distinct from those of hasa, the analog from the gram-positive group a streptococcus.

TI  == [main infectious agents involved in the etiology of lung diseases of small ruminants in northern cameroon].
AB  == between 1990 and 1992, 91 necropsies of small ruminants affected with pulmonary illness led to the isolation of the following strains of mycoplasma (m.): m. mycoides subsp. mycoides lc, m. ovipneumoniae, m. agalactiae, m. sp. type d2 and  m. arginini. eleven pasteurella multocida strains (serotypes a1, a3, a5, a7 and d2) and 11 pasteurella haemolytica strains (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) were isolated. corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, actinomyces pyogenes, staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp., bacillus sp. and mycobacterium sp. were also isolated. thirty-two antibiograms were performed on pasteurella, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and actinomyces pyogenes strains. eighty eight p. cent were sensitive to penicillin g and oxytetracycline, and 84% to chloramphenicol; 50% were not sensitive to spiramycin and 47% to streptomycin. one capripoxvirus strain was isolated on sheep. pest of small ruminants (ppr) virus was detected by immunocapture elisa test performed on some lung samples. two serological surveys, one for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (898 goats),  between 1991 and 1993, and one for ppr (902 sheep and goats) in 1993, were conducted in the north and far north provinces. no antibody against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia was detected. among the animals in the sample, ppr prevalence was 64 +/- 7% in the far north province and 14 +/- 3% in the north province. concerning control measures, a vaccination campaign against small ruminant pasteurellosis appears to be hardly feasible because of the antigenic diversity of the isolated pasteurella strains. ppr is endemic especially in the far north province. the efficiency of a vaccination campaign against ppr must be  estimated with a field survey.
