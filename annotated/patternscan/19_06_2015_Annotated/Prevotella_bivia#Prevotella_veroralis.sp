TI  == a pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of the non-pigmented prevotella species.
AB  == collection strains (21) and non-pigmented clinical isolates (96) provisionally identified as prevotella spp. were classified numerically on the basis of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms) data and reaction patterns in conventional tests (ctrps) for volatile and non-volatile fatty acids, pre-formed enzymes and biochemical activity. pms and ctrp classifications were compared with a previous  classification based on visual analysis of sds-page patterns. although the order  of clusters differed, cross-tabulation of cluster membership revealed strong correlations between classifications. cluster membership in the pms classification correlated particularly well with sds-page results. ctrp clusters  corresponded largely to the recognised species of prevotella, but pms and sds-page divided two species into sub-groups: two in p. buccae and five in p. veroralis. the latter subgroups could be discriminated by small but consistent differences in ctrps. an undesignated, well differentiated cluster of strains appeared closest to the main group of p. buccae strains in pms and ctrps. b. (p.) capillus could not be distinguished from p. buccae; these species are regarded as synonymous. strains of p. zoogleoformans and b. (p.) pentosaceus were well separated from other strains in pms. a complex comprising clusters of p. disiens, p. oralis, p. veroralis, p. loescheii and a further undesignated group similar to p. melaninogenica was well differentiated from p. buccae and p. oris in pms; clusters corresponding to p. bivia, p. corporis, p. intermedia and p. denticola formed another complex.

TI  == characterisation of non-pigmented species of the genus prevotella by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli previously known as the melaninogenicus-oralis group of bacteroides have been assigned to a new genus, prevotella. the non-pigmented members of this genus share several general characteristics and cannot be readily distinguished by routine tests. a polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis procedure, with visual analysis of protein patterns, was used to  compare cellular protein patterns from clinical isolates with those from collection (reference) strains. reference strains of p. oralis, p. veroralis, p.  buccalis, p. oris, p. buccae, p. zoogleoformans, p. bivia, p. disiens, p. oulora, b. (p.) capillus and b. (p.) pentosaceus, and 91 non-pigmented isolates from patients with adult periodontal disease were examined by conventional biochemical tests, gas-liquid chromatography (glc) and enzyme tests, and whole-cell protein profiles were obtained by sds-page. there was close correlation between patterns  of results in biochemical and glc tests and the sds-page profiles, and the species were readily distinguished in sds-page. the periodontal isolates were assigned to 10 groups by conventional test reaction patterns and nine groups by sds-page; the profiles of 79 isolates corresponded to those of seven species reference strains. by sds-page, clinical isolates of p. buccae (42 isolates) and  p. oralis (eight isolates) showed good similarity with reference strains. however, for p. veroralis (15), p. oris (7), p. bivia (4), p. zoogleoformans (2)  and p. buccalis (1), clinical isolates showed some minor variations from reference strains. twelve isolates remained undesignated in sds-page analysis. variant sds-page profiles divided clinical isolates of p. buccae into two subgroups and those of p. veroralis into five subgroups.
