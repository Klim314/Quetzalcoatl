TI  == microbial biofilm development on neonatal enteral feeding tubes.
AB  == neonates in intensive care units often require supporting medical devices and antibiotic treatment. the intensive care treatment combined with their immature immune system, the increased permeability of mucosa, and the undeveloped microflora of the gut may render the neonates highly vulnerable to colonisation and subsequent infections when exposed to opportunistic pathogens. these infections may not only be local gastrointestinal infections, but also systematic following translocation from the gastrointestinal system. this could be particularly alarming considering that common antibiotics may not be effective if the causative strain is multi-drug resistant.this chapter reviews our information on the microbial colonization of neonatal feeding tubes. the range of organisms which have been recovered are wide, and while primarily bacterial, fungi such as  candida have also been found. the bacteria are principally staphylococcus spp. and enterobacteriaceae. the enterobacteriaceae isolates are predominantly enterobacter cancerogenus, serratia marcescens, enterobacter hormaechei, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. many of these isolates encode for antibiotic resistance; e. hormaechei (ceftazidine and cefotaxime) and s. marcescens strains (amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav).

TI  == neonatal enteral feeding tubes as loci for colonisation by members of the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to determine whether neonatal nasogastric enteral feeding tubes are colonised by the opportunistic pathogen cronobacter spp. (enterobacter sakazakii) and other enterobacteriaceae, and whether their presence was influenced by the feeding regime. methods: one hundred and twenty-nine tubes were collected from two neonatal intensive care units (nicu). a questionnaire on feeding regime was completed with each sample. enterobacteriaceae present in the tubes were identified using conventional and molecular methods, and their antibiograms determined. results: the neonates were  fed breast milk (16%), fortified breast milk (28%), ready to feed formula (20%),  reconstituted powdered infant formula (pif, 6%), or a mixture of these (21%). eight percent of tubes were received from neonates who were 'nil by mouth'. organisms were isolated from 76% of enteral feeding tubes as a biofilm (up to 107 cfu/tube from neonates fed fortified breast milk and reconstituted pif) and in the residual lumen liquid (up to 107 enterobacteriaceae cfu/ml, average volume 250 mul). the most common isolates were enterobacter cancerogenus (41%), serratia marcescens (36%), e. hormaechei (33%), escherichia coli (29%), klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), raoultella terrigena (10%), and s. liquefaciens (12%). other organisms isolated included c. sakazakii (2%),yersinia enterocolitica (1%),citrobacter freundii (1%), e. vulneris (1%), pseudomonas fluorescens (1%), and p. luteola (1%). the enteral feeding tubes were in place between < 6 h (22%)  to > 48 h (13%). all the s. marcescens isolates from the enteral feeding tubes were resistant to amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav. of additional importance was that a quarter of e. hormaechei isolates were resistant to the 3rd generation cephalosporins ceftazidime and cefotaxime. during the period of the study, k. pneumoniae and s. marcescens caused infections in the two nicus. conclusion: this study shows that neonatal enteral feeding tubes, irrespective of feeding regime,  act as loci for the bacterial attachment and multiplication of numerous opportunistic pathogens within the enterobacteriaceae family. subsequently, these organisms will enter the stomach as a bolus with each feed. therefore, enteral feeding tubes are an important risk factor to consider with respect to neonatal infections.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the beta-lactamase gene and surrounding dna sequences of citrobacter braakii, citrobacter murliniae, citrobacter werkmanii, escherichia fergusonii and enterobacter cancerogenus.
AB  == to further identify the origins of plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases that are currently spreading worldwide, the chromosomal beta-lactamase genes of citrobacter braakii, citrobacter murliniae, citrobacter werkmanii reference strains and of escherichia fergusonii and enterobacter cancerogenus clinical isolates were cloned and expressed into escherichia coli and sequenced. these beta-lactamases had all a single pi value >8 and conferred a typical ampc-type resistance pattern in e. coli recombinant strains. the cloned inserts obtained from genomic dnas of each strain encoded ambler class c beta-lactamases. the ampc-type enzymes of c. murliniae, c. braakii and c. werkmanii shared 99%, 96% and 95% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, with chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases from citrobacter freundii. the ampc-type enzyme of e. cancerogenus shared 85% amino acid sequence identity with the chromosomal ampc beta-lactamase of enterobacter cloacae oudhyp and the ampc-type enzyme of e. fergusonii shared 96% amino acid sequence identity with that of e. coli k12. the  ampc genes, except for e. fergusonii, were associated with genes homologous to regulatory ampr genes of other chromosomal class c beta-lactamases that explain inducibility of beta-lactamase expression in these strains. this work provides further evidence of the molecular heterogeneity of class c beta-lactamases.

TI  == chromosomal ampc genes in enterobacter species other than enterobacter cloacae, and ancestral association of the act-1 plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase to enterobacter asburiae.
AB  == the amplification and sequence of ampc genes in enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter cancerogenus, enterobacter dissolvens, enterobacter hormaechei and enterobacter intermedius bring the number of known cephalosporinase sequences from the genus enterobacter to seven. expression in escherichia coli of the ampc  genes from e. asburiae, e. hormaechei and e. intermedius established the functional nature of these genes. ampc from e. asburiae shows 96.5% identity to bla(act-1) encoding a plasmid-borne cephalosporinase previously believed to derive from enterobacter cloacae. the reassignment of act-1 ancestry to e. asburiae is confirmed by the 95.5% identity between ampr upstream of bla(act-1) and ampr from e. asburiae.
