TI  == causative pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity, resistance patterns, and severity in a contemporary series of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == objective: to identify the causative pathogens and evaluate the antibiotic sensitivity, resistance patterns, and virulence in a contemporary series of patients with fournier's gangrene. materials and methods: the medical records of  41 consecutive cases of fournier's gangrene were evaluated. the patient demographics, causative pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity, and resistance patterns were assessed. the fournier's gangrene severity index and length of stay were analyzed statistically to determine any differences by causative pathogen. results: a total of 122 pathogens were cultured. the wound cultures were polymicrobial for 34 patients (83%). most common pathogens cultured were bacteroides sp (43.9%), escherichia coli (36.6%), and prevotella sp (34.1%). e coli was resistant to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 13.3%, and 40% of isolates respectively. the wound cultures were monomicrobial for 7 patients (17.0%). a monomicrobial isolate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was cultured that was susceptible to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam was seen in providencia sp, klebsiella sp, e coli, and methicillin-resistant s aureus. resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamicin was seen in methicillin-resistant s aureus and e coli, respectively. no resistance to clindamycin was demonstrated. no statistically significant difference was detected between the fournier's gangrene severity index or length of stay and the causative pathogens. conclusion: fournier's gangrene remains a community-acquired polymicrobial infection, with anaerobic bacteria as the most common causative pathogens. candida and methicillin-resistant s aureus are emerging causative pathogens, but  methicillin-resistant s aureus remains sensitive to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. although resistance was demonstrated by some causative pathogens, together, the currently recommended broad-spectrum antibiotics adequately covered all pathogens. coverage with agents such as fluconazole, vancomycin, or piperacillin-tazobactam is indicated in patients at risk of fungal or hospital-acquired organisms.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterization of a novel xylanase from the symbiotic sphingobacterium sp. tn19.
AB  == a xylanase-encoding gene, designated xyna19, was cloned from sphingobacterium sp. tn19--a symbiotic bacterium isolated from the gut of batocera horsfieldi larvae--and expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). the full-length xyna19 (1,155 bp in length) encodes a 384-residue polypeptide (xyna19) containing a predicted signal peptide of 24 residues and a catalytic domain belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 10 (gh 10). the deduced amino acid sequence of xyna19 is most similar (53.1% identity) to an endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from prevotella bryantii b(1)4. phylogenetic analysis of gh 10 bacteroidia xylanases indicated that gh 10 xylanases from sphingobacteria were separated into two clusters, and xyna19 is more closely related to the xylanases of bacteroidia from gut or rumen  than to those of flavobacteria and sphingobacteria from other sources. recombinant xyna19 (r-xyna19) showed apparent optimal activity at ph 6.5 and 45 degrees c. compared with thermophilic and mesophilic counterparts, r-xyna19 was more active at low temperatures, retaining >65% of its maximum activity at 20-28  degrees c and approximately 40% even at 10 degrees c, and modeling indicated that xyna19 has fewer hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. these properties suggest that xyna19 has various potential applications, especially in aquaculture and the food industry.

TI  == characterization of chorioamnionitis in 2nd-trimester c-section placentas and correlation with microorganism recovery from subamniotic tissues.
AB  == prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  we characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and  microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. the subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include actinomyces, prevotella bivia, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of streptococci, and mycoplasma sp., including ureaplasma urealyticum. these microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). recovery of microorganisms from placental  parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. the same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with dystocia and retained placenta in iraqi buffaloes.
AB  == the present study was conducted on 50 recently calved iraqi buffalo cows. depending on the kind of parturition, buffalo cows were divided into two main groups, the first group had normal unassisted parturition (np) (26 animals) and the second group with certain periparturent complications (ppc) (24 animals). after 24 h of parturition, these two groups were further subdivided into two groups as cows expel their foetal membranes in <24 h postpartum and referred as non-retained placenta (nrp) while cows that did not expel their foetal membrane after 24 h referred as retained placenta (rp). sampling for bacteriology, uterine discharge for polymorphonuclear cells per cent and blood samples for polymorphonuclear neutrophil (pmn) and the enzyme creatine kinase activity were performed at 6, 24 and 48 h postpartum. in ppc group, the most prevalent bacteria after 6 h of calving were escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci and lactobacillus acidophilus. total bacterial isolates in the uterus of buffaloes with rp in ppc group after 24 and 48 h were 129 and 183 respectively. among the isolates, archanobacterium pyogenes, fusobacterium necrophorum, prevotella melaninogenicus and staphylococcus aureus were the most prevalent isolates after  48 h of rp buffaloes in ppc group. polymorphonuclear neutrophil were significantly (p < 0.01) increased in the uterine discharge than in blood in buffaloes with rp in both ppc and np groups. in conclusion, uterine contamination occurs as a result of postpartum ascending contamination by non-specific environmental organisms. the presence of lactobacillus sp. in the uterus indicated a healthy uterus. peripartum complications followed by retention of foetal membranes with the dominance of e. coli in the uterine lumen might favour  the colonization of other bacteria including facultative anaerobic and strictly anaerobic in the uterine wall of buffaloes.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis.
AB  == background: aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. the aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)  gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. methods: universal eubacterial primers  were used to amplify 16s rrna bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. subsequently, pcr amplicons were cloned into escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity  or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in genbank. results: sequences of stenotrophomonas spp., including s. maltophilia (formerly pseudomonas homology group v) were detected in six aneurysm samples. propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and brevundimonas diminuta (formerly p. diminuta) in four samples. other species previously assigned to the pseudomonas genus such as comamonas testosteroni, delftia acidovorans, burkholderia cepacia, herbaspirillum sp., and acidovorax sp. were also detected. some clones fell into other environmental species, including methylobacterium sp. and bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria  that have not yet been cultivated. dna sequences from oral bacteria, including streptococcus sanguinis, tannerella forsythia, and leptotrichia buccalis were detected. sequences from prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. additional species included dermacoccus spp. and corynebacterium vitaeruminis. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development.  several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. clinical relevance: although chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. in the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. the presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at c.pneumoniae.

TI  == detection and characterization of beta-lactamase genes in subgingival bacteria from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  == fifty-three beta-lactamase-producing strains of oral bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontitis in norway and usa were screened for the presence of the bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(oxa), bla(ampc), bla(cfxa), and bla(cepa/cbla) genes by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr products were characterized by direct sequencing of the amplified dna. thirty-four of the  53 enzyme-producing strains (64%) were positive in one of the pcr assays. all beta-lactamase-producing prevotella and capnocytophaga spp. were cfxa positive. tem-type beta-lactamases were identified in one strain each of escherichia coli and neisseria sp., and one strain of citrobacter freundii possessed an ampc-type  beta-lactamase. screening for gene cassettes and genes known to be associated with integrons did not reveal the presence of integrons in these oral bacteria. sequence analyses showed that most cfxa positive prevotella and capnocytophaga isolates from patients with refractory periodontitis harboured variants of the cfxa2 and cfxa3 enzyme. the present study also showed that many different genetic determinants of beta-lactamase production are found in bacteria isolated from refractory periodontitis, many of which remain to be characterized.

TI  == etiology of persistent tubo-ovarian abscess in nairobi, kenya.
AB  == objective: to study the microbial etiology of tubo-ovarian abscess (toa). methods: we recruited 11 women in nairobi, kenya who failed antibiotic therapy alone and required surgical drainage of a presumptive toa. pus from the nine abscesses and two pyosalpinges were collected and cultured for aerobic, facultative and anaerobic microorganisms. results: eleven women suspected of having a toa were hospitalized and treated for a median of 6 days (range 3-14 days) prior to surgical drainage of the abscess. nine (82%) specimens were culture positive. aerobes were present in all nine specimens. seven of the nine positive cultures (78%) were polymicrobial and five of the polymicrobial cultures contained both anaerobes and aerobes. anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (prevotella sp., porphyromonas sp. and bacteroides sp., escherichia coli) and streptococcus sp. (s. viridans and s. agalactiae) were the most common microorganisms isolated. neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis were not isolated by culture or detected by polymerase chain reaction. conclusions: in kenya, persistent toas are associated with endogenous flora similar to that normally found in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == objectives: to assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (bl) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (aecb). methods: the microbiology, bl production by the different isolates, and bl contents in the sputum were determined. results: eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). the predominant aerobic isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), haemophilus influenzae (11), moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (19), prevotella sp. (11), and fusobacterium sp.(6). mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. the predominant aerobic blpb were h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobic blpb were prevotella sp. and fusobacterium sp. beta-lactamase activity  was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which blpb were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor blpb. conclusions: the rapid detection of bl activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with aecb.

TI  == mutant analysis of prevotella sp. plaa-lacz fusion protein expression in escherichia coli: support for an essential role of the stem-loop.
AB  == this study investigated the involvement of rna folding in the synthesis of a fusion protein with beta-galactosidase activity. the coding gap region of the prevotella loescheii adhesin gene plaa was fused in-frame with the escherichia coli lacz gene on plasmid psk105. n-terminal sequencing of the expressed plaa-lacz protein indicated that it resulted from translational initiation at a fortuitous ribosomal-binding site within the plaa sequence at nt 570. specific mutations were introduced in the stem-loop region that precedes the gap sequence. analysis of stem-loop mutants, together with the introduction of compensatory mutations that restored activity, supports a requirement for stem-loop formation  within the plaa sequence preceding the translational initiation site. a mutation  reducing the predicted size of the loop, but preserving the stem structure, inactivated fusion protein synthesis. a suppressor mutation predicted to restore  the size of the loop restored efficient fusion protein synthesis. in addition, the sequence preceding the translational start site of the plaa-lacz fusion has several similarities to sequences that function as translational enhancers in prokaryotes. these include a stem-loop structure, an a-u rich region preceding the initiation codon, and a region of homology to 16s rrna.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

(ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. they included 103 ps asaccharolyticus, 74 ps magnus,  56 ps prevotii, 51 ps micros, 46 ps anaerobius, 11 ps morbilorum, and 10 ps saccharolyticus. most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), ps were recovered in pure culture. most ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. these were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). the organisms most commonly isolated with ps were bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 b. fragilis group), prevotella sp. (159), fusobacterium sp. (122), escherichia coli (114), and staphylococcus aureus (97). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. these data illustrate the importance of ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
