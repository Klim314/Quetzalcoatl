TI  - A randomized controlled trial to test the effect of multispecies probiotics on cognitive reactivity to sad mood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent insights into the role of the human microbiota in cognitive and affective functioning have led to the hypothesis that probiotic supplementation may act as an adjuvant strategy to ameliorate or prevent depression. OBJECTIVE: Heightened cognitive reactivity to normal, transient changes in sad mood is an established marker of vulnerability to depression and is considered an important target for interventions. The present study aimed to test if a multispecies probiotic containing Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W52, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Lactobacillus brevis W63, Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactobacillus salivarius W24, and Lactococcus lactis (W19 and W58) may reduce cognitive reactivity in non-depressed individuals. DESIGN: In a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, pre- and post-intervention assessment design, 20 healthy participants without current mood disorder received a 4-week probiotic food-supplement intervention with the multispecies probiotics, while 20 control participants received an inert placebo for the same period. In the pre- and post-intervention assessment, cognitive reactivity to sad mood was assessed using the revised Leiden index of depression sensitivity scale. RESULTS: Compared to participants who received the placebo intervention, participants who received the 4-week multispecies probiotics intervention showed a significantly reduced overall cognitive reactivity to sad mood, which was largely accounted for by reduced rumination and aggressive thoughts. CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence that the intake of probiotics may help reduce negative thoughts associated with sad mood. Probiotics supplementation warrants further research as a potential preventive strategy for depression.
TI  - Effect of Probiotic Containing Ice-cream on Salivary Mutans Streptococci (SMS) Levels in Children of 6-12 Years of Age: A Randomized Controlled Double Blind Study with Six-months Follow Up.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the caries risk based on the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans in children of 6-12 years of age group before and after consuming probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out in 60 children aged between 6 to 12 years with zero decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT). They were randomly divided into two equal groups. Saliva sample were collected before the consumption of ice-cream and Streptococcus mutans count was calculated and recorded as baseline data. For the next seven days both the groups were given ice creams marked as A and B. Saliva samples were collected after ice-cream consumption at the end of study period and also after a washout period of 30 days and again after six months. Samples were inoculated and colonies were counted. RESULTS: On statistical evaluation by students paired t-test, probiotic ice-cream brought significant reduction in the Streptococcus mutans count after seven days of ice-cream ingestion (p<0.001) and also after 30 d of washout period (p<0.001). There was no significant reduction (p=0.076) by normal ice-cream consumption. After six months of the study period in both the groups the salivary levels of Streptococcus mutans was similar to the baseline. CONCLUSION: Probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 can cause reduction in caries causative organism. The dosage of the probiotic organisms for the long term or synergetic effect on the oral health are still needed to be explored.
TI  - Characterization of the effects of three Lactobacillus species on the function of chicken macrophages.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus salivarius can influence the adaptive immune responses in chickens but vary in their ability to do so. The present study attempted to identify how these three bacteria alter the innate immune system. A chicken macrophage cell line, MQ-NCSU, was co-cultured with the three live Lactobacillus species, alone or in combination, grown at different temperatures for various durations of time. Late exponential growth phase bacteria were more immunostimulatory, while bacterial growth temperature had little effect. L. acidophilus and L. salivarius significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production and phagocytosis, while L. reuteri did not. In fact, L reuteri was shown to inhibit NO production of macrophages when co-cultured with the other bacteria or when cells were pre-treated with LPS. The results demonstrate a possible molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effects of L. acidophilus and L. salivarius, and a unique immunomodulatory ability of L. reuteri.
TI  - Effect of Bile Salt Hydrolase Inhibitors on a Bile Salt Hydrolase from Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Bile salt hydrolase (BSH), a widely distributed function of the gut microbiota, has a profound impact on host lipid metabolism and energy harvest. Recent studies suggest that BSH inhibitors are promising alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) for enhanced animal growth performance and food safety. Using a high-purity BSH from Lactobacillus salivarius strain, we have identified a panel of BSH inhibitors. However, it is still unknown if these inhibitors also effectively inhibit the function of the BSH enzymes from other bacterial species with different sequence and substrate spectrum. In this study, we performed bioinformatics analysis and determined the inhibitory effect of identified BSH inhibitors on a BSH from L. acidophilus. Although the L. acidophilus BSH is phylogenetically distant from the L. salivarius BSH, sequence analysis and structure modeling indicated the two BSH enzymes contain conserved, catalytically important amino residues and domain. His-tagged recombinant BSH from L. acidophilus was further purified and used to determine inhibitory effect of specific compounds. Previously identified BSH inhibitors also exhibited potent inhibitory effects on the L. acidophilus BSH. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the BSH from L. salivarius is an ideal candidate for screening BSH inhibitors, the promising alternatives to AGP for enhanced feed efficiency, growth performance and profitability of food animals.
TI  - Safety and protective effectiveness of two strains of Lactobacillus with probiotic features in an experimental model of salmonellosis.
AB  - Two strains of Lactobacillus, previously isolated from bovine faeces and tested in vitro for properties desired in probiotics, were evaluated for their in vivo effectiveness in protecting against experimental salmonellosis. L. salivarius L38 and L. acidophilus L36 previously demonstrated the ability to successfully colonize the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice and stimulate the immune system associated with the intestinal mucosa. L38- or L36-feeding showed no detrimental effect on the general health indicators and did not induce changes in normal architecture of liver and small intestine, indicating that the use of these strains is apparently safe. In control animals fed L38 strain, several cytokines had augmented mRNA levels that can be associated with a homeostatic state of intestinal mucosa, while L36 had less diverse regulation. IgA production and secretion in the intestinal lumen induced by infection was abrogated by pretreating with both lactobacilli. In addition, liver and small intestine histological scores and, translocation of Salmonella cells to liver and spleen, indicated that these strains did not confer protection against the infection. So, the IL-12:IL-18aIFN-g axis, essential for an effective immune response against Salmonella, was not favored with L38 or L36 strains. However, increased expression of IL-10 in different portions of the gastrointestinal tract of L38-fed animals is indicative of anti-inflammatory effect to be explored furthermore.
TI  - Effect of intestinal colonisation by two Lactobacillus strains on the immune response of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The effect of intestinal colonisation on the immune system was investigated in germ-free mice monoassociated with Lactobacillus strains isolated from calf faeces. Single doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus L36 or Lactobacillus salivarius L38 were administered to germ-free mice by intragastric gavage. Ten days later, the mice were euthanised. Gene expression levels of interleukin 5 (IL-5), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12b, IL-17a, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were quantified in segments of the small and large intestines by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. All the mice were colonised rapidly after Lactobacillus administration with intestinal counts ranging from 6.53 to 8.26 log cfu/g. L. acidophilus L36 administration increased the expression of cytokines involved with the Th2 (IL-5, IL-6 and TGF-beta1) and Th17 (IL-17a, TNF-alpha and IL-6) inflammatory response, whereas L. salivarius L38 appeared to stimulate a pattern of less diversified cytokines in the intestine. Intragastric gavage of L. acidophilus L36 and L. salivarius L38 induced similar levels of colonisation in the digestive tracts of germ-free mice but stimulated different immune responses in the intestinal mucosa. The different immunomodulation patterns might facilitate the potential use of these lactobacilli as probiotics to treat distinct pathological conditions, for example protection against Citrobacter rodentium infection by stimulating IL-17 production.
TI  - Differential effects of lactobacilli on activation and maturation of mouse dendritic cells.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are of interest because of their potential to modulate immune responses. The effects of LAB range from regulation to stimulation of the immune system. A series of studies were performed in vitro to study the effects of six lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus helveticus LH-2, Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5, La-115, La-116 and La-14, and Lactobacillus salivarius, on maturation and activation of mouse dendritic cells. Production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-?, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 by dendritic cells (DCs) was determined after treating cells with live LAB. The expression of DC maturation markers, CD80 and CD40, was also measured using flow cytometry after stimulation with LAB. In addition, the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2, 4 and 9 by DCs stimulated with LAB was measured. Our results revealed that LAB act differentially on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production and induction of co-stimulatory molecules by DCs. Specifically, L. salivarius was found to be the most effective LAB to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Moreover, La-14, La-116 and La-5 induced moderate maturation and activation of DCs. On the other hand, LH-2 and La-115 were the least effective lactobacilli to induce DC responses. The present study also revealed that L. salivarius was able to induce the expression of TLR2, 4 and 9 by DCs. In conclusion, various strains and species of LAB can differentially regulate DC activation and maturation, providing further evidence that these bacteria may have the ability to influence and steer immune responses in vivo.
TI  - Characterization of the most abundant Lactobacillus species in chicken gastrointestinal tract and potential use as probiotics for genetic engineering.
AB  - The count and diffusion of Lactobacilli species in the different gastrointestinal tract (GI) regions of broilers were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the probiotic characteristics of six L. reuteri species isolated from broilers' GI tract were also investigated to obtain the potential target for genetic engineering. Lactobacilli had the highest diversity in the crop and the lowest one in the cecum. Compared with the lower GI tract, more Lactobacilli were found in the upper GI tract. Lactobacillus reuteri, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, and L. aviarius were the predominant Lactobacillus species and present throughout the GI tract of chickens. Lactobacillus reuteri was the most abundant Lactobacillus species. Lactobacillus reuteri XC1 had good probiotic characteristics that would be a potential and desirable target for genetic engineering.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - [Identification and biological properties of intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from aged women].
AB  - The strains of lactic acid bacteria have been isolated from the intestine of older women. These strains were identified and their biological activity was studied. It has been established that Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. salivarius var. salivarius and Enterococcus faecium had the highest antagonistic activity against opportunistic microorganisms. It has been revealed, that the adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of the tested cultures had strain specificity. Most of the isolates were highly adhesive and did not produce hemolysins.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antibacterial effects of four dentine bonding systems: An in vitro study.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate and the compare antibacterial efficacy of four dentin bonding system against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus acidophilus over a period of three months using agar disk diffusion test. METHODOLOGY: All the three standard bacterial strains were inoculated into BHI broth and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. A 100 mul of broth suspension containing aliquots of S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus were spread onto M-H agar medium using sterile cotton swabs. The experimental groups were as follows: GROUP A: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against S. mutans MTCC 497, GROUP B: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against S. salivarius MTCC 1938, and GROUP C: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against L. acidophilus MTCC 447. For sample preparation, 20 mul bonding agent was dropped with micropipettes on paper disks, and blown dry for 10 seconds. Then it was light-cured at 2 mm for 20 sec using a QTH visible light curing unit. For first reading, the sample disks were placed over the freshly inoculated agar plates and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. The rest of the paper disks were stored in dark, submerged in distilled water at 37 degrees C. They were placed on freshly inoculated spread plates after specific time intervals- 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after ageing in PBS. After incubation, the diameters of zones of inhibition around the plates were measured. The experiment was performed twice in triplicate. The data was then statistically analysed using Two way ANOVA test and post hoc. RESULTS: Results showed that Xeno III had the maximum antibacterial efficacy over a period of three months, followed by XP bond. This antibacterial activity was maximum against Streptococcus mutans, followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus and least against Streptococcus salivarius. Adper Easy One and G bond had minimal effect against the test bacteria during the test period. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effect decreased over a period of three months for all the dentin bonding systems.
TI  - Analysis of cariogenic bacteria in saliva of cancer patients.
AB  - This study examined salivary flow and salivary pH and the prevalence and levels of cariogenic bacteria in the saliva of oncological patients and healthy controls. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the levels of microbes including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus acidophilus in the saliva of 41 patients with a solid tumor (SO), 30 patients with a hematologic malignancy (HE), and 40 healthy controls. Salivary flow and pH were lower in oncological patients than in controls. The frequencies of all four cariogenic bacteria were highest in the SO group. S. mutans and L. salivarius were the most commonly detected in all three study groups. Mean numbers of S. sobrinus and L. salivarius in the SO group were significantly higher than in controls (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between patients and controls with respect to mean numbers of S. mutans and L. acidophilus in saliva. However, the proportions of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and L. salivarius versus total bacteria in the SO group were significantly higher than in controls. Within patients, both mean numbers and the proportions of S. mutans and S. sobrinus were significantly different (p<0.05). In summary, significant differences were found in salivary pH values and the levels of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and L. salivarius between SO patients and healthy controls.
TI  - Changes in satiety hormone concentrations and feed intake in rats in response to  lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A negative energy balance can be accomplished by reducing the caloric intake which results in an increased feeling of hunger. This physiological state is regulated by secretion of satiety hormones. The secretion of these hormones can be influenced by ingestion of e.g. fat. Fat, dairy beverage and synbiotic mixture have been found to have satiety-inducing effects in humans and rats. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the change of satiety hormone concentration in rats in response to feeding of fermented milks containing lactic acid bacteria. Two studies were conducted with Wistar rats randomly allocated into groups receiving Lactobacillus fermented (2 L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. salivarius and L. rhamnosus) milk. A single isocaloric oral dose with the test item or control was given to the rats. Blood samples were taken after dosing with the test product and the satiety hormones were measured. For the test groups, significant changes could be detected in PYY concentrations after 60 min, although some groups had a significant lower feed intake. In conclusion, some probiotic Lactobacillus strains may modify satiety hormones production. However, more studies are needed to evaluate their potential of prolonging satiety.
TI  - Effect of immersion and inoculation in ovo of Lactobacillus spp. in embryonated chicken eggs in the prevention of Salmonella Enteritidis after hatch.
AB  - The protection level against Salmonella Enteritidis was evaluated in chickens after in ovo treatment with different species of Lactobacillus spp. inoculated into the air cell or by immersion in broth culture. Two hundred forty embryonated eggs were distributed into 8 groups, corresponding to treatments with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and control. On d 18 of incubation, 4 groups were inoculated with 0.1 mL of inoculum in the air cell and 4 groups were immersed for 3 min in culture of each treatment. Two days after hatching, 0.5 mL of Salmonella Enteritidis culture was inoculated by the intraesophageal route. On d 5 of life, the chicks were euthanized and the ceca were processed to obtain Salmonella Enteritidis counts. There was no decrease in Salmonella Enteritidis colonization of chick ceca, regardless of treatment or route of administration. Lactobacillus spp. samples used in the treatment showed no probiotic potential in chicks when inoculated in ovo, in relation to Salmonella Enteritidis inhibition in poultry ceca.
TI  - Catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  - Metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". The metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. In this review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. The genus Lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. They are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. Indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (GIT; including the mouth, stomach, small intestine and large intestine). Here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species with a proven ability to adapt to the GIT. As examples this review concentrates on the following species - Lb. plantarum, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. ruminis, Lb. salivarius, Lb. reuteri and Lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.
TI  - The effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. A completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. The highest count of faecal Enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log CFU g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. The highest count of Lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log CFU g(-1)). Moreover, the MALDI TOF MS Biotyper identified the following genera: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, as well as Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. fermentum and L. salivarius from the Lactobacilli group and Enterococcus avium, E. casseliflavus, E. cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus from the Enterococci group. Additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of chickens were tested. The best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against K. oxytoca.
TI  - Effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: A bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07; -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (bLf), but the results are inconsistent. Moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-bLf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield bLf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-bLf. However, whether bLf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. Therefore, various probiotic strains in Taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate in vitro. Thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741, Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 53103, Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707, and Bifidobacterium lactis BCRC 17394 were inhibited by both apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate. The growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, including L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272, Lactobacillus fermentum ATCC 11739, Lactobacillus coryniformis ATCC 25602, L. acidophilus BCRC 14065, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 29521, and Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8081. However, apo-bLf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the supernatants produced by L. fermentum, B. lactis, and B. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. Importantly, a combination of apo-bLf or bLf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. In conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-bLf and bLf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-bLf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
TI  - In-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saponins were extracted from Bauhinia purpurea, Madhuca longifolia, Celastrus paniculatus and Semecarpus anacardium and purified. Antimicrobial properties of these saponins against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Madhuca longifolia saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Streptococcus mitis and Staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and Bauhinia purpurea saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION: The strong antimicrobial activity of Madhuca longifolia and Bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. Hence, these extracted saponins may be used in food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly Irish subjects.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms Lactobacillus bulgaricus LMG 6901 and Listeria innocua DPC 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. Genomic fingerprinting following ApaI digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. The antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. The predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Enterococcus spp. A number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including ABP-118 and salivaricin B (from Lact. salivarius), enterocin B (Enterococcus faecium), lactacin B (Lact. acidophilus), gassericin T and a variant of gassericin A (Lact. gasseri), were identified. Interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: Lactococcus lactis producing nisin Z and Streptococcus mutans producing mutacin II. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
TI  - Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection by the probiotic strains Lactobacillus johnsonii MH-68 and L. salivarius ssp. salicinius AP-32.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection includes antimicrobial agents and proton pump inhibitors. We have examined the ability of Lactobacillus spp. to inhibit H. pylori infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Probiotic strains isolated from samples of adult feces, infant feces, breast milk, and vaginal swab collected from healthy volunteers in Taiwan and commercially available strains were screened for antagonism toward H. pylori. Inhibition liquid culture assay was used to screen potential anti-H. pylori activity. Then, we performed agar plate inhibition assay, and assays to determine the capacity of probiotics for adhesion, and inhibition and killing of H. pylori, and measured the levels of IL-8 and IL-10. Using animal models, we studied regulation of gastric acid and histopathological changes accompanying anti-H. pylori activity. RESULTS: We found that six of the tested strains suppressed urease activity of H. pylori: Lactobacillus acidophilus TYCA08, L. acidophilus TYCA15, L. johnsonii MH-68, and L. salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32 were more effective than the others. In vivo, L. johnsonii MH-68 and L. salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32 alone or in combination, reduced the H. pylori load in the gastric mucosa, and also reduced inflammatory chemokine expression and lymphocyte infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus johnsonii MH-68 and L. salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32 effectively suppress H. pylori viability, and when used as probiotics, they may help decrease the occurrence of gastritis, and even reduce the risk of H. pylori infection.
TI  - Bugs that debugs: Probiotics.
AB  - The oral cavity harbors a diverse array of bacterial species. There are more than 600 species that colonize in the oral cavity. These include a lot of organisms that are not commonly known to reside in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and also are more familiar: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The balance of all these microorganisms can easily be disturbed and a prevalence of pathogenic organisms can lead to various oral health problems including dental caries, periodontitis, and halitosis.
TI  - Differential cytokine expression in T-cell subsets of chicken caecal tonsils co-cultured with three species of Lactobacillus.
AB  - Members of the intestinal microbiota play an important role in the development of T-cells. Little is known about responses of intestinal T-cell subsets of chickens to commensal bacteria. Therefore, we set out to characterise cytokine responses in T-cells after exposure to lactobacilli. Caecal tonsil mononuclear cells were isolated and co-cultured with Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus salivarius for 12 hours. Subsequently the CD4+ and CD8+ cells were fractionated by flow cytometry and the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as Toll-like receptor 21 (TLR21) was determined. The results demonstrated that chicken CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells express TLR21 and that the various isolates of lactobacilli differentially induces the expression of interleukin 10, interferon-gamma and transforming growth factor beta. Our results demonstrate that different Lactobacillus species have the capacity to regulate intestinal T-cell responses and that these responses may be important to intestinal homeostasis.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of a new haemostatic agent on oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the antibacterial effect of a newly developed haemostatic agent Ankaferd Blood Stopper(R) (ABS) and Ferric Sulphate (FS) on various oral microorganisms. STUDY DESIGN: Bacterial strains were freshly incubated in their specific broth media. For each of the strains, 3 wells per each agent, with a 5 mm diameter were made under aseptic conditions in the specific agar media. Then they were filled with a test agents or 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) (control group). After 24h and 48h incubation periods, inhibition zones were measured. RESULTS: ABS showed antibacterial effect on all test microorganisms except Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus salivarius. Ferric sulphate and CHX have antibacterial effect on all microorganisms. When the test agents compared, the inhibition zones of the ABS were found smaller than the ferric sulphate and CHX. CONCLUSIONS: Although ferric sulphate and ABS have antibacterial effect, ferric sulphate had better antibacterial activity than ABS on oral microorganisms under in vitro condition. FS and ABS not only exhibit the haemostatic activity but also antimicrobial activity. Key words:Ankaferd blood stopper, ferric sulphate, haemostatic agent, haemostasia, bleeding, bactericide.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. The propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. The addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. The highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. The highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). With RTQ PCR detected species from the genus Enterococcus were: E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus and from genus Lactobacillus were: Lactobacillus crispatus, L. acidophilus and L. salivarius. With MALDI TOF MS Biotyper from Enterobacteriaceae genera were identified Citrobacter braakii, Raoultella ornithinolytica, Serratia fonticola, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca. Antimicrobial activities In vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. The best antimicrobial effect of Citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on the treatment of children with atopic dermatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis, a chronic recurrent disease, is frequently encountered in clinical practice. In the last 30 years, the prevalence of atopic dermatitis has rapidly increased due to industrialization. Therefore, there have been attempts in recent years to find new ways of treating and preventing atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVE: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, a combination of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus salivarius strains were evaluated in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients. METHODS: Forty pediatric patients (23 males and 17 females) aged 1~13 years were enrolled. One eligible individual who was approached declined to participate. The probiotic group was administered a probiotic complex containing B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, L. casei, and L. salivarius for 8 weeks. The placebo group, on the other hand, was administered skim milk powder and dextrose. All of the parameters including serum cytokines, eosinophil cationic protein), SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index, and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) were measured in both the probiotic group and the placebo group at the end of 8 weeks. RESULTS: Probiotic intervention in pediatric atopic dermatitis patients effectively reduced the SCORAD index and serum cytokines interleukin (IL)-5, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and total serum IgE levels, but did not reduce levels of serum cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, ECP, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Our study found probiotics to be effective in reducing atopic dermatitis patients' SCORAD index, serum IL-5, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and total serum IgE levels but not effective in reducing serum IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, ECP, or TNF-alpha levels.
TI  - Determination of wine microbiota using classical method, polymerase chain method  and Step One Real-Time PCR during fermentation process.
AB  - The aim of our study was the identification of grape, must and wine microbiota during the fermentation process using a classical microbiological method and Real-Time PCR. The changes in different groups of microorganisms were monitored in total counts of bacteria, lactobacilli and yeasts. Microbiological parameters were observed during the current collection and processing of grapes in 2009. Samples were taken during the fermentation process in wine enterprises and a private vineyard. During this period 30 samples of wine among Muller Thurgau, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Tramin and Red Bio-wine were examined. Samples were collected from stages of grape-must unfiltered, grape-must filtered, the beginning of fermentation, fermentation, late fermentation and young wine. The highest total counts of bacteria ranged from 0.00 to 176 +/- 15 CFU.mL(-1) in the wine of Muller Thurgau, the highest number of yeast ranged from 0.00 to 150 +/- 9 CFU.mL(-1) in the wine of Muller Thurgau and the number of Lactobacillus spp. ranged from 0.00 to 92 +/- 5 CFU.mL(-1) in the sample of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The presence and sensitivity of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus salivarius were detected using Real-Time PCR (RTQ PCR). Susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium varied in different isolates from 1 to 10(6) CFU.mL(-1), the sensitivity of the species Lactobacillus acidophilus in different isolates of the wine samples ranged from 1 to 10(5) CFU.mL(-1). We also monitored representation of species Lactobacillus crispatus, which were captured by RTQ PCR sensitivity and ranged from 1 to 10(5) CFU.mL(-1). Identification of the species Lactobacillus salivarius in each of isolates by RTQ PCR method showed the presence of these bacteria in the range of 1 to 10(4) CFU.mL(-1).
TI  - Transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants between lactobacilli isolates from the gastrointestinal tract of chicken.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential horizontal transfer of genetic  traits for antibiotic resistance between lactobacilli isolated from the chicken gut, both in vitro and in vivo. Thirty-seven Lactobacillus spp. strains isolated from the gizzard, small and large intestines and caeca of free-range broiler chickens showed multi-drug resistance as assessed by disc diffusion assays. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for vancomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol was determined in De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe broth in a microplate assay. Almost all the lactobacilli isolates were resistant to vancomycin (except strains belonging to the Lactobacillus acidophilus group) and to tetracycline (MIC>/=128 mug/ml). Only five strains were resistant to erythromycin, and six to chloramphenicol. The transfer rate in filter mating experiments performed using L. acidophilus strain 4M14E (EmR), Lactobacillus vaginalis strain 5M14E (CmR), Lactobacillus salivarius strain 5C14C (EmR), and the 4G14L and 3C14C strains of Lactobacillus reuteri (CmR) showed a frequency of approximately 1x104 cfu/ml of double-resistant transconjugants for the different combinations. The exception was the L. salivarius 5C14C (EmR) and L. vaginalis 5M14E (CmR) mating combination, which produced no transconjugants. In vivo experiments performed in gnotobiotic mice by mating L. acidophilus 4M14E (EmR) with L. reuteri 3C14C (CmR), L. reuteri 4G14L (CmR) or L. vaginalis 5M14E (CmR) resulted in transconjugants at 3.95+/-0.29, 3.16+/-0.33, and 4.55+/-1.52 log10 cfu/g of faeces, respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that genetic exchange may occur between native bacterial strains within the gastrointestinal tract of chickens, which might maintain a dynamic gene pool conferring antibiotic resistance upon indigenous microbiota components, even in the absence of the pathogens. This possibility must be taken into account as a complementary criterion when lactobacilli are screened for probiotic use.
TI  - The influence of probiotic treatment on sulfasalazine metabolism in rat.
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms claimed to exert beneficial effects on the host. This study investigated their effect on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of sulfasalazine (SSZ), a drug whose efficacy depends on metabolism by azoreductase (AR) in the gut microbiota to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-acetylsalicylic acid (5-ASA). The probiotic strains Lactobacillus acidophilus L10, Bifidobacterium lactis B94 and Streptococcus salivarius K12 possessed AR activity and a corresponding ability to metabolize SSZ. Treatment of male Wistar rats (n = 5) with oral 2 g doses of a mixture of the three probiotics (total dose 1.8 x 10(9) cfu) every 12 h for 3 days resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in AR activity in ex vivo colon contents with a corresponding increase in SSZ metabolism. Similar probiotic treatment of male Wistar rats (n = 8) followed by an oral 100 mg/kg dose of SSZ produced high plasma levels of SP, but pharmacokinetic parameters of SSZ and SP were not significantly different from control rats given SSZ. These results indicate that probiotic strains possess AR activity and can metabolize SSZ. Treatment with probiotics increases AR activity in the gut microbiota but has no effect on plasma levels of SSZ and SP following a subsequent oral dose of SSZ.
TI  - Qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of Lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal Chinese women.
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of Lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy Chinese women. Vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy Chinese women were analysed using a 16S rRNA gene clone library and species-specific PCR followed by sequencing and real-time PCR. A total of 13 different Lactobacillus species were detected. Species-specific PCR showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of Lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. Among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of Lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. In the fertile women, L. iners (82.61%), L. crispatus (70.65%) and L. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than L. jensenii (40.22%), L. acidophilus (39.13%), L. brevis (23.91%), L. plantarum (5.43%), L. johnsonii (3.26%), L. fermentum (2.17%), L. salivarius (2.17%), L. rhamnosus (1.09%), L. reuteri (1.09%) and L. paracasei (1.09%); L. delbrueckii was not detected. In the postmenopausal women, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, L. reuteri and L. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just a few samples. The prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific PCR. According to the semiquantitative analysis, the total Lactobacillus DNA concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. Sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by L. iners, 35% by L. crispatus, and 2% by L. gasseri. Associations between pairs of Lactobacillus species in fertile women were significant (P<0.05) between the following pairs: L. iners and L. gasseri, L. iners and L. jensenii, L. iners and L. acidophilus, L. gasseri and L. acidophilus, and L. gasseri and L. jensenii. In conclusion, this study provided detailed information on Lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy Chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. The study also showed that the diversity of Lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. According to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific PCR and comparison against a 16S rRNA gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. These findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of bacterial communities. According to our findings regarding species associations, L. iners and L. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of other vaginal Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Comparison of fructooligosaccharide utilization by Lactobacillus and Bacteroides  species.
AB  - The utilization of 1-kestose (GF(2)) and nystose (GF(3)), the main components of  fructooligosaccharides (FOS), by Lactobacillus and Bacteroides species was examined. Of seven Lactobacillus and five Bacteroides strains that utilized FOS, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus, L. casei, and L. gasseri utilized only GF(2), whereas L. acidophilus and all the Bacteroides strains utilized both GF(2) and GF(3). Only the strains able to utilize both GF(2) and GF(3) had beta-fructosidase activity in the culture supernatants. The culture supernatants of the Lactobacillus strains had higher beta-fructosidase activity for GF(2) than for GF(3), whereas those of the Bacteroides strains had higher activity for GF(3) than for GF(2). Furthermore, beta-fructosidase activity of the culture supernatants of the Lactobacillus cells grown in the GF(3) medium was much higher than that of the cells grown in the GF(2) medium, whereas the activity of the culture supernatants of the Bacteroides cells grown in the GF(3) medium was almost the same as that of the cells grown in the GF(2) medium. These results indicate that Lactobacillus species metabolize FOS in a different way from that of Bacteroides species.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - Analysis of the human intestinal epithelial cell transcriptional response to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Bifidobacterium lactis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The complex microbial population residing in the human gastrointestinal tract consists of commensal, potential pathogenic and beneficial species, which are probably perceived differently by the host and consequently could be expected to trigger specific transcriptional responses. Here, we provide a comparative analysis of the global in vitro transcriptional response of human intestinal epithelial cells to Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420, and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC). Interestingly, L. salivarius Ls-33 DCE-induced changes were overall more similar to those of B. lactis 420 than to L. acidophilus NCFM, which is consistent with previously observed in vivo immunomodulation properties. In the gene ontology and pathway analyses both specific and unspecific changes were observed. Common to all was the regulation of apoptosis and adipogenesis, and lipid-metabolism related regulation by the probiotics. Specific changes such as regulation of cell-cell adhesion by B. lactis 420, superoxide metabolism by L. salivarius Ls-33, and regulation of MAPK pathway by L. acidophilus NCFM were noted. Furthermore, fundamental differences were observed between the pathogenic and probiotic treatments in the Toll-like receptor pathway, especially for adapter molecules with a lowered level of transcriptional activation of MyD88, TRIF, IRAK1 and TRAF6 by probiotics compared to EHEC. The results in this study provide insights into the relationship between probiotics and human intestinal epithelial cells, notably with regard to strain-specific responses, and highlight the differences between transcriptional responses to pathogenic and probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Some low homogenization pressures improve certain probiotic characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-K.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. Commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 MPa or less. It is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. Objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0, 3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 MPa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12, S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, and L. acidophilus LA-K. The cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees C) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. Growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. Acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of incubation. Protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. All homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. A pressure of 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. Homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of L. acidophilus LA-K but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. Some low homogenization pressures positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and L. acidophilus LA-K. Culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.
TI  - Oral treatment of chickens with lactobacilli influences elicitation of immune responses.
AB  - Commensal microbes in the intestine are in constant interaction with host cells and play a role in shaping the immune system. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus salivarius are members of the chicken intestinal microbiota and have been shown to induce different cytokine profiles in mononuclear cells in vitro. The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of these bacteria individually or in combination on the induction of antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses in vivo. The birds received lactobacilli weekly via oral gavage starting on day of hatch and subsequently, at 14 and 21 days, were immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), Newcastle disease virus vaccine, and infectious bursal disease virus vaccine. Antibody responses in serum were measured weekly for 4 weeks beginning on the day of primary immunization. The cell-mediated immune response was evaluated at 21 days postimmunization by measurement of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production in splenocytes stimulated with inactivated vaccine antigens. L. salivarius-treated birds had significantly more serum antibody to SRBC and KLH than birds that were not treated with probiotics. L. salivarius-treated birds also had decreased cell-mediated immune responses to recall antigen stimulation. L. reuteri treatment did not significantly affect the systemic immune response, while L. acidophilus treatment increased the antibody response to KLH. These results indicate that systemic antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses can be modulated by oral treatment with lactobacilli but that these bacteria may vary in their ability to modulate the immune response.
TI  - Regulation of the IL-10/IL-12 axis in human dendritic cells with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - In this study, we have used monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) to design a screening model for the selection of microorganisms with the ability to suppress DC-secreted IL-12p70, a critical cytokine for the induction of T-helper cell type 1 immune responses under inflammatory conditions. By the treatment of DCs with cocktails containing TLR agonists and proinflammatory cytokines, the cells increased the secretion of the Th1-promoting cytokine IL-12p70. Clinically used probiotics were tested for their IL-10- and IL-12p70-stimulating properties in immature DCs, and showed a dose-dependent change in the IL-10/IL-12p70 balance. Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM() and the probiotic mixture VSL#3 showed a strong induction of IL-12p70, whereas Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33 and Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 preferentially induced IL-10. Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 induced both IL-10 and IL-12p70, whereas the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii induced low levels of cytokines. When combining these microorganisms with the Th1-promoting cocktails, E. coli Nissle 1917 and B. infantis 35624 were potent suppressors of IL-12p70 secretion in an IL-10-independent manner, indicating a suppressive effect on Th1-inducing antigen-presenting cells. The present model, using cocktail-stimulated DCs with potent IL-12p70-stimulating capacity, may be used as an efficient tool to assess the anti-inflammatory properties of microorganisms for potential clinical use.
TI  - Consumption of probiotics increases the effect of regulatory T cells in transfer  colitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics may alter immune regulation. Recently, we showed that the  probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM influenced the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vitro. The aim of the present work was to demonstrate if L. acidophilus NCFM also affects the function of Tregs in vivo. METHODS: Development of colitis after transfer of CD4+CD25- T cells and protection from colitis by Tregs was studied in immunodeficient SCID mice which were simultaneously tube-fed with L. acidophilus NCFM or L. salivarius Ls-33 for 5 weeks. RESULTS: Probiotic-fed SCID mice transplanted with low numbers of Tregs in addition to the disease-inducing T cells were completely protected from colitis. This was in contrast to the control group, which showed intermediate levels of inflammation. In addition, feeding with probiotics lowered serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in both colitic mice and in mice protected from colitis by Tregs. Gene expression patterns of rectum samples of protected mice that receive either one of the probiotics showed a closer resemblance to naive SCID mice than did patterns of the control group. The mechanism of action of the probiotics appears to be an indirect effect by inducing a Treg-favorable environment rather than a direct effect on the Tregs. CONCLUSIONS: L. acidophilus NCFM and L. salivarius Ls-33 feeding of SCID mice increases the in vivo effect of Tregs, resulting in a gene expression pattern in the rectum resembling that of the naive SCID mouse.
TI  - Metabolism of L-selenomethionine and selenite by probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - Since selenium supplements have been shown to undergo biotransformation in the gut, probiotic treatment in combination with selenium supplements may change selenium disposition. We investigated the metabolism of L-selenomethionine (SeMet) and selenite by probiotic bacteria in vitro and the disposition of selenium after probiotic treatment followed by oral dosing with SeMet and selenite in rats. When SeMet was incubated anaerobically with individual antibiotic-resistant probiotic strains (Streptococcus salivarius K12, Lactobacillus rhamnosus 67B, Lactobacillus acidophilus L10, and Bifidobacterium lactis LAFTI(R) B94) at 37 degrees C for 24 h, 11-18% was metabolized with 44-80% of SeMet lost being converted to dimethyldiselenide (DMDSe) and dimethylselenide (DMSe). In similar incubations with selenite, metabolism was more extensive (26-100%) particularly by the lactobacilli with 0-4.8% of selenite lost being converted to DMSe and DMDSe accompanied by the formation of elemental selenium. Four groups of rats (n = 5/group) received a single oral dose of either SeMet or selenite (2 mg selenium/kg) at the time of the last dose of a probiotic mixture or its vehicle (lyoprotectant mixture used to maintain cell viability) administered every 12 h for 3 days. Another three groups of rats (n = 3/group) received a single oral dose of saline or SeMet or selenite at the same dose (untreated rats). Serum selenium concentrations over the subsequent 24 h were not significantly different between probiotic and vehicle treated rats but appeared to be more sustained (SeMet) or higher (selenite) than in the corresponding groups of untreated rats. Probiotic treated rats given SeMet also had selenium concentrations at 24 h that were significantly higher in liver and lower in kidney than untreated rats given SeMet. Thus, treatment with probiotics followed by SeMet significantly affects tissue levels of selenium.
TI  - [PH and oxidation-reduction potential change of environment during a growth of lactic acid bacteria: effects of oxidizers and reducers].
AB  - Decrease of pH and dropping of oxidation-reduction potential have been observed during growing Lactobacillus salivarius 1588 and 3823, Lactobacillus acidophilus 101E, and Lactococcus lactis 3690 in anaerobic conditions in medium with glucose acidification. These parameters and membrane proton permeability of bacteria (C(M)(H+)) changed in the mediums with different pH. Oxidizer ferrycianide and reducer DL-dithiothreitol affected the bacterial growth and their changed H+ extrusion from the cells and K+ uptake by the cells in experiment conditions. Application of oxidizers and reducers are suggested for regulation of growth related with H+ ion transport in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - The effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. METHODS: Twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (MS) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. The polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. Stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. The samples were cultured for MS, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. A part of the samples were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnose, L. plantarum, Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, Veillonella parvula. RESULTS: The MS counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (P<.01) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. Also the plaque MS percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (P<.01). The salivary MS counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. Nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. The DNA-DNA hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced MS counts in plaque but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.
TI  - Characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  - The study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from fermented foods in Xi'an, China. LAB strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of Lactobacillus (n = 73), and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and S. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). Some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. Minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of Lactobacillus. The erm(B) gene was detected from two strains of each of L. fermentum and L. vaginalis, and one strain of each of L. plantarum, L. salivarius, L. acidophilus, L. animalis, and S. thermophilus. The tet genes were identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. This is the first time, the authors identified tet(S) gene from L. brevis and L. kefiri. The erm(B) gene from L. fermentum NWL24 and L. salivarius NWL33, and tet(M) gene from L. plantarum NWL22 and L. brevis NWL59 were successfully transferred to Enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. It was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in Xi'an, China and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - Rapid molecular identification and characteristics of Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Eleven type strains and 24 Lactobacillus isolates, preliminarily classified to the species due to phenotypic features, were investigated. Standard methods of identification with species-specific PCRs and typing with PFGE (with ApaI, NotI and SmaI restriction enzymes) allowed us to distinguish 16 unique strains belonging to 5 species (L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. salivarius). Alternative approach with 16S-23S rDNA ARDRA identification (with merely two restrictases, BsuRI and TaqI) and PCR-based typing (RAPD with two random- and rep-PCR with (GTG)(5) primers) showed to be more discriminative, i.e. 21 unique strains were classified in the same species as above. As a result, 7 out of 24 phenotypically species-assigned isolates were reclassified. The alternative procedure of rapid identification and typing of Lactobacillus isolates appeared to be equally effective and shortened from 1 week to 2-3 d (in comparison to the standard methods).
TI  - Effects of lactobacilli on cytokine expression by chicken spleen and cecal tonsil cells.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus salivarius are all normal residents of the chicken gastrointestinal tract. Given the interest in using probiotic bacteria in chicken production and the important role of the microbiota in the development and regulation of the host immune system, the objective of the current study was to examine the differential effects of these bacteria on cytokine gene expression profiles of lymphoid tissue cells. Mononuclear cells isolated from cecal tonsils and spleens of chickens were cocultured with one of the three live bacteria, and gene expression was analyzed via real-time quantitative PCR. All three lactobacilli induced significantly more interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) expression in spleen cells than in cecal tonsil cells, indicating a more inflammatory response in the spleen than in cecal tonsils. In cecal tonsil cells, substantial differences were found among strains in the capacity to induce IL-12p40, IL-10, IL-18, transforming growth factor beta4 (TGF-beta4), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). In conclusion, we demonstrated that L. acidophilus is more effective at inducing T-helper-1 cytokines while L. salivarius induces a more anti-inflammatory response.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Invasion of the gut by pathogenic Salmonella leads to production of IL-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. However, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress IL-8 production prevent tissue damage. We hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of IL-8 synthesis. Caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis W52, Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactococcus lactis W58, Lactobacillus acidophilus W70, Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, or Lactobacillus salivarius W24 or pathogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell for 1 hour. Cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of Salmonella as either co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by Salmonella (1 hour). The cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. IL-8 and Hsp70 were determined by ELISA and Western blot respectively. Both probiotics and Salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of IL-8 but probiotics induced far lower IL-8 levels than Salmonella. The Salmonella-induced IL-8 was significantly suppressed by B. infantis W52, L. casei W56 and L. lactis W58 at low numbers of Salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/Caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. The observed probiotic-mediated reduction in IL-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. In addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in Hsp70 expression while L. acidophilus W70, B. bifidum W23 and L. salivarius W24 induced a weak Hsp70 expression and could not suppress the Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis. We conclude that suppression of Salmonella-induced IL-8 synthesis by Caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of Hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via Hsp70 expression. This suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic Salmonella.
TI  - Enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  - Soymilk (SM) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of SM with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. In this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, HOWARU L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium lactis type Bi-07, B. longum, HOWARU B. bifidum, and B lactis type Bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into SM and soymilk supplemented with lactose (SML). A total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 L of SM with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. Samples of SM were incubated at 37 degrees C and 10 mL aliquots of SM were taken at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results indicated that SML fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log CFU/mL than that in SM at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. Mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general Lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log CFU/mL more cells than Bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. The total aglycone content in SM at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 mL, whereas that in SML was 1.623 mg/100 mL. Addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in SM but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. Mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.
TI  - Inducer bacteria, unique signal peptides, and low-nutrient media stimulate in vitro bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus spp. and Enterococcus spp. Strains.
AB  - Bacteriocins (BCN) are antimicrobial peptides that provide potential to control bacterial infections in a variety of applications. We previously reported on three class IIa BCN molecules produced by Lactobacillus salivarius B-30514 (OR-7), Enterococcus faecium B-30746 (E 50-52), and Enterococcus durans/faecium/hirae B-30745 (E-760). These BCN are notably effective against a wide array of pathogenic bacteria. To commercially apply such BCN, adequate quantities must be produced and harvested. We determined that a combination of host producer synthesized signal peptides (SP) in the presence of both producer and inducer bacteria grown in a dilute fermentation medium enabled marked increases in the synthesis of BCN. These SP contained 24-30 amino acid residues with sizes ranging from 2095 to 3065 Da having the unique terminal carboxyl sequence of VKGLT. The inducer bacterial isolates used were Lactobacillus acidophilus B-30510 and Lactobacillus crispatus B-30884. We used a nutrient-limited medium of 10% brucella broth (containing 0.01% glucose) to enhance BCN production. Using the combination of these above three parameters enabled us to reproducibly harvest at least 200 mg of BCN/L of the spent fermentation broth. This information can be used to assist in the production of BCN.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against Candida SPP.
AB  - Urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. The treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. In this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against Candida spp. The LAB were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis, adhesion to Caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). All lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four Candida species into different degrees; among them L. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. The highest amount of lactic acid was produced by L. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by L. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), L. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and L. jensenii (5.4 g/l). All isolates produced H2O2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for L. acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, and L. vaginalis. Only L. agilis, L. jensenii, L. johnsonii and L. ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial Caco-2 cells. Among the isolates evaluated, L agilis, L. jensenii, L. johnsonii, and L. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.
TI  - Use of colony-based bacterial strain typing for tracking the fate of Lactobacillus strains during human consumption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are important components of the healthy gut flora and have been used extensively as probiotics. Understanding the cultivable diversity of LAB before and after probiotic administration, and being able to track the fate of administered probiotic isolates during feeding are important parameters to consider in the design of clinical trials to assess probiotic efficacy. Several methods may be used to identify bacteria at the strain level, however, PCR-based methods such as Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) are particularly suited to rapid analysis. We examined the cultivable diversity of LAB in the human gut before and after feeding with two Lactobacillus strains, and also tracked the fate of these two administered strains using a RAPD technique. RESULTS: A RAPD typing scheme was developed to genetically type LAB isolates from a wide range of species, and optimised for direct application to bacterial colony growth. A high-throughput strategy for fingerprinting the cultivable diversity of human faeces was developed and used to determine: (i) the initial cultivable LAB strain diversity in the human gut, and (ii) the fate of two Lactobacillus strains (Lactobacillus salivarius NCIMB 30211 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCIMB 30156) contained within a capsule that was administered in a small-scale human feeding study. The L. salivarius strain was not cultivated from the faeces of any of the 12 volunteers prior to capsule administration, but appeared post-feeding in four. Strains matching the L. acidophilus NCIMB 30156 feeding strain were found in the faeces of three volunteers prior to consumption; after taking the Lactobacillus capsule, 10 of the 12 volunteers were culture positive for this strain. The appearance of both Lactobacillus strains during capsule consumption was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We have shown that genetic strain typing of the cultivable human gut microbiota can be evaluated using a high throughput RAPD technique based on single bacterial colonies. Validation of this strategy paves the way for future systematic studies on the fate and efficacy of bacterial probiotics during human clinical trials.
TI  - Screening of Quercus infectoria gall extracts as anti-bacterial agents against dental pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A number of bacteria have now become antibiotic-resistant. This increases the importance of ayurvedic drugs. We report, here, the activity of different extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water) of Quercus infectoria galls against dental pathogens -- Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus acidophilus (designated) and Streptococcus sanguis (isolated). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cup-plate method was used in anti-bacterial activity of the extracts at concentration of 200 mg/ml against dental pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of most effective extracts against the most susceptible bacteria were determined using a two-fold serial micro dilution method. RESULTS: Methanolic extract showed maximum anti-bacterial activity against all the bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were S. sanguis followed by S. aureus, S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus. The MIC values showed that methanolic extract was more effective than water extract. CONCLUSION: The plant has the potential to generate herbal metabolites. The crude extracts demonstrating anti-dental caries activity could result in the discovery of new chemical classes of antibiotics. These chemical classes of antibiotics could serve as selective agents for the maintenance of human health and provide bio-chemical tools for the study of infectious diseases.
TI  - AI-2 signalling is induced by acidic shock in probiotic strains of Lactobacillus  spp.
AB  - Survival and ability to respond to various environmental stresses such as low pH  are important factors for lactobacilli for their function as probiotics. LuxS-mediated quorum sensing mechanism, which is based on the production of universal signal molecule called autoinducer-2 (AI-2), regulates important physiological traits and a variety of adaptive processes in different bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acidic stress on LuxS-mediated quorum sensing (AI-2 signalling) in four probiotic strains of different Lactobacillus species. Initially, the production of AI-2-like molecule was investigated in four strains of Lactobacillus spp. at standard growth conditions using Vibrio harveyi bioluminescence assay. Species variation in AI-2 activity was observed. AI-2 activity started at early-exponential growth phase and increased during the mid-exponential phase concomitant with the reduction of pH, reaching maximum at late exponential phase (L. rhamnosus GG) or at stationary phase (L. salivarius UCC118, L. acidophilus NCFM and L. johnsonii NCC533). Acidic shock experiments were conducted on L. rhamnosus GG and L. acidophilus NCFM after exposure to different acidic shocks (pH 5.0, 4.0 and 3.0) and to pH 6.5 as control, measuring AI-2 activity and transcription of the luxS gene. AI-2 activity increased by lowering the pH in a dose dependent manner and was negatively influenced by acid adaptation. In both species, the luxS gene was repressed after exposure to pH 6.5 as control. However, after acidic shock (pH 4.0) a transient response of luxS gene was observed and the transcription augmented over time, reaching a maximum level and decreased subsequently. Acid adaptation of cells attenuated the transcription of this gene. Based on the observations done in the present study, the luxS gene appears to have a clear role in acidic stress response in probiotic lactobacilli. This might be important in the survival of these bacteria during the passage through the gastrointestinal tract, and further influence the cell-to-cell communication among bacteria in the intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Effect of homogenization techniques on reducing the size of microcapsules and the survival of probiotic bacteria therein.
AB  - This study investigated 2 different homogenization techniques for reducing the size of calcium alginate beads during the microencapsulation process of 8 probiotic bacteria strains, namely, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, Bifidobacterium longum, B. lactis type Bi-04, and B. lactis type Bi-07. Two different homogenization techniques were used, namely, ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer and Microfluidics microfluidizer. Various settings on the homogenization equipment were studied such as the number of passes, speed (rpm), duration (min), and pressure (psi). The traditional mixing method using a magnetic stirrer was used as a control. The size of microcapsules resulting from the homogenization technique, and the various settings were measured using a light microscope and a stage micrometer. The smallest capsules measuring (31.2 microm) were created with the microfluidizer using 26 passes at 1200 psi for 40 min. The greatest loss in viability of 3.21 log CFU/mL was observed when using the ultra-turrax benchtop homogenizer with a speed of 1300 rpm for 5 min. Overall, both homogenization techniques reduced capsule sizes; however, homogenization settings at high rpm also greatly reduced the viability of probiotic organisms.
TI  - Antigen-presenting cells exposed to Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Bifidobacterium bifidum BI-98, and BI-504 reduce regulatory T cell activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect in vitro of six different probiotic strains including Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei YS8866441, Lactobacillus plantarum Lp-115, Bifidobacterium bifidum BI-504 and BI-98 was studied on splenic enteroantigen-presenting cells (APC) and CD4(+)CD25(+) T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in splenocyte-T cell proliferation assays. METHODS: Splenocytes exposed to enteroantigen +/- probiotics were used to stimulate cultured CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells to which titrated numbers of Tregs were added. Cytokine assays were performed by use of neutralizing antibodies and ELISA. RESULTS: Exposure of APCs to enteroantigens and the series of probiotic strains mentioned above did not influence the stimulatory capacity of APCs on proliferative enteroantigen-specific T cells. However, exposure to B. bifidum BI-98, BI-504 and L. acidophilus NCFM consistently reduced the suppressive activity of Tregs. The suppressive activity was analyzed using fractionated components of the probiotics, and showed that a component of the cell wall is responsible for the decreased Treg activity in the system. The probiotic-induced suppression of Treg function is not mediated by changes in APC-secretion of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 or IL-1b. CONCLUSION: We conclude that certain probiotic strains can modify APCs to cause reduced Treg activity. This effect apparently depends on a direct APC-to-Treg cell contact. The APC-mediated suppressive effect on Treg function of certain probiotic strains may constrain the anti-inflammatory activity, which is often desired from probiotic therapy. This unexpected function of certain probiotic strains should be taken into consideration when designing adjuvant therapies with these bacteria, or when probiotic strains are selected for improvement of gut-associated inflammation like IBD.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus RY2 isolated from healthy infancy feces on the growth and adhesion characteristics of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.
AB  - Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) infection is an important cause of acute diarrhea, affecting children in developing countries and travelers visiting tropical or subtropical areas. Three probiotics can exert bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects on human and animal intestinal pathogens, the efficiency of probiotics on EAggEC infection remains unclear. In this study, the antagonistic activity of probiotic bacteria isolated from infant faeces was examined against several EAggEC stains. While three isolates, Lactobacillus acidophilus RY2, Lactobacillus salivarius MM1 and Lactobacillus paracasei En4 were shown to significantly inhibit the growth of EAggEC. In addition, the antagonistic activity of the Lactobacillus species was maintained despite heating (100 degrees C, 15 min) of cell free culture supernatant (CFCS). The antagonistic activity of the CFCS however, could be reduced following lactate dehydrogenase treatment and at pH 7.2. Furthermore, in an adhesion-inhibition assay, L. acidophilus RY2 was shown to be more effective than L. salivarius MM1 and L. paracasei EN4. This study suggests that L. acidophilus RY2 could be used as a probiotic organism against EAggEC.
TI  - An improved method of microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria for their stability in acidic and bile conditions during storage.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a method for applying an extra coating of palm oil and poly-L-lysine (POPL) to alginate (ALG) microcapsules to enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria. Eight strains of probiotic bacteria including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, B. lactis type Bl-O4, and B. lactis type Bi-07 were encapsulated using alginate alone or alginate with POPL. Electron microscopy was used to measure the size of the microcapsules and to determine their surface texture. To assess if the addition of POPL improved the viability of probiotic bacteria in acidic conditions, both ALG and POPL microcapsules were inoculated into pH 2.0 MRS broths and their viability was assessed over a 2-h incubation period. Two bile salts including oxgall bile salt and taurocholic acid were used to test the bile tolerance of probiotic bacteria entrapped in ALG and POPL microcapsules. To assess the porosity and the ability of the microcapsule to hold small molecules in an aqueous environment a water-soluble fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6 FAM), was encapsulated and its release was monitored using a UV spectrophotometer. The results indicated that coating the microcapsules with POPL increased the overall size of the capsules by an average of 3 microm +/- 0.67. However, microcapsules with added POPL had a much smoother surface texture when examined under an electron microscope. The results also indicated that the addition of POPL to microcapsules improved the average viability of probiotic bacteria by > 1 log CFU/mL when compared to ALG microcapsules at 2 h of exposure to acidic conditions. However, similar plate counts were observed between ALG and POPL microcapsules when exposed to bile salts. This suggests that an extra coating of POPL could be readily broken down by bile salts that are commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Upon testing the porosity of the microcapsules, findings suggest that POPL microcapsules were less porous and hold 52.2% more fluorescent dye over a 6-wk storage period.
TI  - Effect of various encapsulating materials on the stability of probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Ten probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, B. lactis type Bl-04, B. lactis type Bi-07, HOWARU L. rhamnosus, and HOWARU B. bifidum, were encapsulated in various coating materials, namely alginate, guar gum, xanthan gum, locust bean gum, and carrageenan gum. The various encapsulated probiotic bacteria were studied for their acid and bile tolerance. Free probiotic organisms were used as a control. The acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested at pH 2 over a 2-h incubation period. Bile tolerance was tested with taurocholic acid over an 8-h incubation period. The permeability of the capsules was also examined using a water-soluble dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6-CF). The permeability was monitored by measuring the amount of 6-CF released from the capsules during a 2-w storage period. Results indicated that probiotic bacteria encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum survived better (P < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria, under acidic conditions. When free probiotic bacteria were exposed to taurocholic acid, viability was reduced by 6.36 log CFU/mL, whereas only 3.63, 3.27, and 4.12 log CFU/mL was lost in probiotic organisms encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum, respectively. All encapsulating materials tested released small amounts of 6-CF; however, alginate and xanthan gum retained 22.1% and 18.6% more fluorescent dye than guar gum. In general, microcapsules made of alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum greatly improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions and bile salts.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  - This study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. Two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed LAMVAB agar). Microscopy, the catalase test, Gram-staining, and RAPD-PCR analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. Phenotypic analysis using the API 50 CH test and genotypic analysis of 16S rDNA sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri. Bacterial survival under the conditions of low pH (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v) of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 33199). The isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, Escherichia coli K88 and Salmonella typhimurium. The high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as piglet probiotics.
TI  - Effect of four probiotic strains and Escherichia coli O157:H7 on tight junction integrity and cyclo-oxygenase expression.
AB  - Controversy exists as to whether contact between a probiotic bacterial cell and an epithelial cell in the gut is needed to confer beneficial effects of probiotics, or whether metabolites from probiotics are sufficient to cause this effect. To address this question, Caco-2 cells were treated with cell-free supernatants of four probiotics, Bifidobacterium lactis 420, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33, and by a cell-free supernatant of a pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC). Tight junction integrity as well as expression of cyclo-oxygenases, which are prostaglandin-producing enzymes, were measured. Probiotic-specific as well as EHEC-specific effects on tight junction integrity and cyclo-oxygenase expression were evident, indicating that live bacterial cells were not necessary for the manifestation of the effects. B. lactis 420 cell-free supernatant increased tight junction integrity, while EHEC cell-free supernatant induced damage on tight junctions. In general, EHEC and probiotics had opposite effects upon cyclo-oxygenase expression. Furthermore, B. lactis 420 cell-free supernatant protected the tight junctions from EHEC-induced damage when administered prior to the cell-free supernatant of EHEC. These results indicate that probiotics produce bioactive metabolites, suggesting that consumption of specific probiotic bacteria might be beneficial in protecting intestinal epithelial cells from the deleterious effects of pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Detection of T lymphocytes in intestine of broiler chicks treated with Lactobacillus spp. and challenged with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis.
AB  - The expression of immune response in the form of leukocytic infiltrate by CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in the epithelium and in the intestinal lamina propria of chicks was studied in the present work by means of immunohistochemical reaction. The chicks were treated with Lactobacillus spp. or cecal microflora (CM) and experimentally challenged or not with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. The 320 birds utilized were divided into 4 groups containing 80 chicks each and submitted to treatments with Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and CM. Each group was subdivided into 4 subgroups of 20 birds each and classified into a subgroup that did not receive treatment (negative control), subgroup treated, subgroup treated and challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis, and subgroup only challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis (positive control). The results obtained show that the treatment with L. reuteri, L. salivarius, L. acidophilus, or CM and challenged or not with Salmonella Enteritidis determine immune response in the form of leukocytic infiltrate by CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes followed by CD4+ in the epithelium and in the lamina propria of the duodenum, jejunum, and cecum of chicks up to 12 d of age. The quantity of CD3+ lymphocytes was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the intestine of chicks treated with L. acidophilus or CM and challenged or not with Salmonella Enteritidis; however, the higher quantity of CD8+ lymphocytes was in the intestine of chicks treated with CM and challenged with Salmonella Enteritidis. The duodenum was the segment in which the immune response by T cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) was stimulated with the greatest intensity, followed by, respectively, the jejunum and cecum. The quantity of CD3+ lymphocytes present in the duodenum, jejunum, and cecum increases with the age of chicks, independent of the stimulus determined by treatments or challenge.
TI  - Three Lactobacillus strains from healthy infant stool inhibit enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli grown in vitro.
AB  - Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are a major cause of sporadic diarrhea disease in humans, affecting mainly infants in developing countries and travelers from industrialized countries visiting tropical or subtropical areas. In this study, we screen the antagonistic activity by inoculating wells among ETEC agar cultures to assess inhibition zones created by the lactobacilli spent culture supernatant (SCS) from healthy infant stool. Only three isolates possessed antagonistic activity, acid and bile tolerance and could adhere to the cultured human intestinal C2BBel (Caco-2) cell line. Isolate identification using API 50CHL strips showed that they belonged to different Lactobacillus species, i.e., Lactobacillus acidophilus RY2, Lactobacillus salivarius MM1 and Lactobacillus paracasei En4. The SCS still had an inhibitory effect on ETEC after heating (100 degrees C, 15 min). The lactate dehydrogenase treatment or the pH of SCS was adjusted to neutral (pH 7.2) to reduce the SCS inhibitory effect. Antimicrobial activity was performed by incubating the lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-SCS with ETEC suspension. After 4h of co-culture, ETEC growth was inhibited. This study suggests that L. acidophilus RY2, L. salivarius MM1 and L. paracasei En4 could be used as an effective control for ETEC.
TI  - Effect of proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole on growth and morphology of oral Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) used to suppress acid secretion in the stomach are among the most widely prescribed medications. There is emerging evidence of proton secretion elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract, and acidic microenvironments are integral to oral flora such as Lactobacillus. The hypothesis of this study is that the growth rate and morphology of oral Lactobacillus strains are effected by PPIs. METHODS: Nineteen different strains of Lactobacilli were inoculated in microtiter plates at pH of 4.5 to 6.5 and exposed to twofold dilutions of pantoprazole at a range of 2.5 mg/mL to 2.5 microg/mL. Bacterial growth was monitored, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug was determined for the strains most sensitive to pantoprazole. RESULTS: In the unexposed (control) group, nine Lactobacilli strains were affected by pH changes from 6.5 to 4.5. In the group exposed to pantoprazole, 9 of the 19 Lactobacilli strains were found to have an MIC below 625 microg/mL, with L. plantarum 14917 being the most sensitive (MIC = 20 microg/mL). In some strains, such as L. s. salivarius 11741, Gram-staining revealed conformational changes in the bacteria when grown in the presence of pantoprazole. CONCLUSION: Growth rates and morphology of oral Lactobacillus are affected by the pH of the environment. Pantoprazole at supraphysiologic doses further affects growth rates and conformation in some strains. SIGNIFICANCE: The balance of oral flora and upper digestive tract homeostasis may be affected by unexpected targets of PPI pharmacotherapy, with possible unanticipated consequences.
TI  - Characterization of dominant cultivable lactobacilli and their antibiotic resistance profiles from faecal samples of weaning piglets.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the lactic acid bacteria flora of weaning piglets, to define the distribution of different lactobacilli species in piglet faecal samples, and to determine the susceptibility phenotype to 11 antibiotic of different families. METHODS AND RESULTS: The faecal samples were taken from piglets with good herd status at 11 and 28 days after weaning. The Lactobacillus isolates (n = 129) from 78 animals housed in pairs in 39 pens were preliminarily identified by their morphology and biochemical characteristics. Partial 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) was used to identify the isolates to the species level, and RAPD (randomly amplified polymorphism DNA) profiles to differentiate Lactobacillus isolates to the strain level. Based on these studies, 67 strains were selected for antibiotic resistant tests. The most numerous Lactobacillus species found in the piglets was Lactobacillus reuteri (n = 43). Other lactobacilli were L. salivarius (n = 15), L. agilis (n = 4), L. johnsonii (n = 2), L. vaginalis (n = 1), L. mucosae (n = 1) and L. gallinarum (n = 1). All the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin. Two L. salivarius isolates and two L. reuteri isolates were found to be multiresistant. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the faecal Lactobacillus flora in piglets consists mainly of L. reuteri, L. salivarius and L. acidophilus group lactobacilli, and the distribution of lactobacilli is similar between individuals of the same age and with the same diet. Most of the Lactobacillus isolates tested were sensitive to the antibiotics used in this study. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Valuable information on Lactobacillus species distribution and their antibiotic resistance profiles in piglets is obtained.
TI  - Acid, bile, and heat tolerance of free and microencapsulated probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Eight strains of probiotic bacteria, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, B. lactis type Bl-O4, and B. lactis type Bi-07, were studied for their acid, bile, and heat tolerance. Microencapsulation in alginate matrix was used to enhance survival of the bacteria in acid and bile as well as a brief exposure to heat. Free probiotic organisms were used as a control. The acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested using HCl in MRS broth over a 2-h incubation period. Bile tolerance was tested using 2 types of bile salts, oxgall and taurocholic acid, over an 8-h incubation period. Heat tolerance was tested by exposing the probiotic organisms to 65 degrees C for up to 1 h. Results indicated microencapsulated probiotic bacteria survived better (P < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria in MRS containing HCl. When free probiotic bacteria were exposed to oxgall, viability was reduced by 6.51-log CFU/mL, whereas only 3.36-log CFU/mL was lost in microencapsulated strains. At 30 min of heat treatment, microencapsulated probiotic bacteria survived with an average loss of only 4.17-log CFU/mL, compared to 6.74-log CFU/mL loss with free probiotic bacteria. However, after 1 h of heating both free and microencapsulated probiotic strains showed similar losses in viability. Overall microencapsulation improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions, bile salts, and mild heat treatment.
TI  - Design of a multispecies probiotic mixture to prevent infectious complications in critically ill patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although the potential for probiotics is investigated in an increasing variety of diseases, there is little or no consensus regarding the desired probiotic properties for a particular disease in question, nor about the final design of the probiotic. Specific strain selection procedures were undertaken to design a disease-specific multispecies probiotic. METHODS: From a strain collection of 69 different lactic acid bacteria a primary selection was made of 14 strains belonging to different species showing superior survival in a simulated gastrointestinal environment. Functional tests like antimicrobial activity against a range of clinical isolates and cytokine inducing capacity in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to further identify potential strains. RESULTS: Specific strains inhibited growth of clinical isolates whereas others superiorly induced the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Based on functional tests and general criteria regarding probiotic design and safety, a selection of the following six strains was made (Ecologic 641); Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactococcus lactis. Combination of these strains resulted in a wider antimicrobial spectrum, superior induction of IL-10 and silencing of pro-inflammatory cytokines as compared to the individual components. CONCLUSIONS: Application of strict criteria during the design of a disease-specific probiotic prior to implementation in clinical trials may provide a rational basis for use of probiotics.
TI  - [Adhesion of various species of lactic acid bacteria depending on the AB0 system  blood group].
AB  - The influence of the AB0 blood groups on adhesion of different lactic acid bacteria species was studied. From twelve investigated strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus species, difference between adhesion average index on erythrocytes of various blood groups was found in two strains. The average adhesion index of the strain E. faecium K-50 in A (II) blood group erythrocytes was higher (AAI = 4.91 +/- 0.26) than in B (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.17 +/- 0.33). The strain L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 4n has displayed a higher adhesive activity in A (II) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.36 +/- 0.13) in comparison with AB (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 3.61 +/- 0.75).
TI  - Identification of lactobacilli isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens and characterization for potential use as probiotics to control Salmonella Enteritidis.
AB  - AIMS: To select Lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control Salmonella Enteritidis infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. All isolates belonged to the Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri or Lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the L. reuteri group being the most predominant group. Based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. Salmonella inhibition was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. A selection of strains was evaluated in a S. Enteritidis challenge experiment. Two strains, L. reuteri R-17485 and Lactobacillus johnsonii R-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by S. Enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit Salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the S. Enteritidis colonization of chicks. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The data demonstrate that Lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic potential in reducing S. Enteritidis infection.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Identification and antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from probiotic products available in Italy.
AB  - This study was carried out to assay the bacterial viability and the probable contamination of a range of probiotic products available in Italy and to test the susceptibility of the isolates. Eleven dried food supplements and five fermented functional foods were examined using different isolation media under standardized cultivation conditions. The identification was made by conventional phenotypic characteristics and biochemical tests. Among isolates from the probiotic products antibiotic susceptibility was detected using the E-test (ABBiodisk). Our results demonstrate that nine food supplements and two fermented foods claimed species which could not be isolated, whereas potential pathogens (i.e. Micromonas micros) were isolated. Lactobacilli displayed species-dependent antibiotic resistance. Atypical resistance occurred for penicillin in Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus and for erythromycin in Lactobacillus lactis and Lactobacillus salivarius. A broad range of MICs was observed for cephalosporins and fluroquinolones. Aminoglycosides had poor activity against Lactobacillus isolates. Two of the four isolates of Bifidobacterium exhibited high resistance to trimethroprim/sulfametoxazole and to fluoroquinolones. Our results suggest that some probiotic products claim species that cannot always be isolated, and are sometimes contaminated by potential pathogens. Moreover, the probable transferable erythromycin or penicillin resistance among the lactobacilli isolated should be taken into account.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria and other gut bacteria in pigs by a macroarraying method.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) consist of many genera, Gram-positive, and nonspore-forming micro-organisms; some members being used as probiotics while some others have negative effects on pig health. Bacterial species in the gastrointestinal tract can produce antibacterial substances, reduce serum cholesterol in their host, or can be responsible for growth reduction, diarrhea, and intestinal epithelial damage. It is therefore important for the pig industry to evaluate the impact of food and farm management on the presence of "good" or "bad" bacteria and the risk for consumers. This articles focuses on the molecular identification of gut microflora species following different diets given to pigs in UK and correlating the data on growth, health, and welfare. First of all, pig feces were individually collected from sows before and after farrowing and also from piglets before and after weaning over several months. Bacteria colonies were grown on MRS agar plates from feces and DNA was extracted (QIAamp DNA stool kit) and amplified using 16S rDNA (27f and 519r) primers. DNA sequencing and sequence alignment allowed us to identify species-specific zones, which were used as probes in a macroarray system also known as reverse line blot hybridization. Some probes were found to be species specific for the following species: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. animalis, L. gallinarum, L. kitasanotis, L salivarius, Streptococcus alactolyticus, S. hyointestinalis, and Sarcina ventriculi. Actual studies are now focusing on the impact of diets of the microflora in different gut parts and at different stages of the animal's life.
TI  - Influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from Gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  - In the present study, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. The LAB identified by 16S-23S rRNA PCR-ARDRA were mainly of Lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of Enterococcus spp. for all animals. Free-range chickens showed a higher presence of Lactobacillus acidophilus while Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. Lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, Lactobacillus vaginalis and Lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and Lactobacillus salivarius in both types. Enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. All LAB isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. Animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of LAB from chicken cecum. LAB isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters.
TI  - Diversity of the genus Lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  - The genus Lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. The authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of Lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of Lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: L. salivarius, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. johnsonii and L. sakei. This paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. Phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested that L. salivarius was closer to L. plantarum than to L. sakei, which was closest to Enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16S rRNA gene relatedness. A total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. Species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. A Lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising L. salivarius-L. plantarum; L. sakei; E. faecalis; and L. acidophilus-L. johnsonii. The extreme divergence of the Lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.
TI  - Alteration of the canine small-intestinal lactic acid bacterium microbiota by feeding of potential probiotics.
AB  - Five potentially probiotic canine fecal lactic acid bacterium (LAB) strains, Lactobacillus fermentum LAB8, Lactobacillus salivarius LAB9, Weissella confusa LAB10, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LAB11, and Lactobacillus mucosae LAB12, were fed to five permanently fistulated beagles for 7 days. The survival of the strains and their potential effects on the indigenous intestinal LAB microbiota were monitored for 17 days. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) demonstrated that the five fed LAB strains survived in the upper gastrointestinal tract and modified the dominant preexisting indigenous jejunal LAB microbiota of the dogs. When the LAB supplementation was ceased, DGGE analysis of jejunal chyme showed that all the fed LAB strains were undetectable after 7 days. However, the diversity of the intestinal indigenous microbiota of the dogs, as characterized from jejunal chyme plated on Lactobacillus selective medium without acetic acid, was reduced and did not return to the original level during the study period. In all but one dog, an indigenous Lactobacillus acidophilus strain emerged as the dominant LAB strain. In conclusion, strains LAB8 to LAB12 have potential as probiotic strains for dogs as they survive in and dominate the jejunal LAB microbiota during feeding and have the ability to modify the intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Selecting lactic acid bacteria for their safety and functionality by use of a mouse colitis model.
AB  - Studies showed that specific probiotics might provide therapeutic benefits in inflammatory bowel disease. However, a rigorous screening of new probiotics is needed to study possible adverse interactions with the host, particularly when intended for administration to individuals with certain health risks. In this context, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of three lactobacilli (LAB) on intestinal inflammation and bacterial translocation using variations of the mouse model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced acute colitis. We first compared the in vitro ability of LAB to survive gastrointestinal tract (GIT) conditions and their ability to persist in the GIT of mice following daily oral administration. As a control, we included a nonprobiotic Lactobacillus paracasei strain, previously isolated from an endocarditis patient. Feeding high doses of LAB strains to healthy and to TNBS-treated mice did not induce any detrimental effect or abnormal translocation of the bacteria. Oral administration of Lactobacillus salivarius Ls-33 had a significant preventive effect on colitis in mice, while Lactobacillus plantarum Lp-115 and Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM did not. None of the three selected LAB strains translocated to extraintestinal organs of TNBS-treated mice. In contrast, L. paracasei exacerbated colitis under severe inflammatory conditions and translocated to extraintestinal organs. This study showed that evaluations of the safety and functionality of new probiotics are recommended. We conclude that not all lactobacilli have similar effects on intestinal inflammation and that selected probiotics such as L. salivarius Ls-33 may be considered in the prevention or treatment of intestinal inflammation.
TI  - Isolation of a Lactobacillus salivarius strain and purification of its bacteriocin, which is inhibitory to Campylobacter jejuni in the chicken gastrointestinal system.
AB  - We evaluated anti-Campylobacter jejuni activity among >1,200 isolates of different lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacillus salivarius strain NRRL B-30514 was selected for further study. The cell-free, ammonium sulfate precipitate from the broth culture was termed the crude antimicrobial preparation. Ten microliters of the crude preparation created a zone of C. jejuni growth inhibition, and growth within the zone resumed when the crude preparation was preincubated with proteolytic enzymes. Bacteriocin OR-7, derived from this crude preparation, was further purified using ion-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. The determined amino acid sequence was consistent with class IIa bacteriocins. Interestingly, OR-7 had sequence similarity, even in the C-terminal region, to acidocin A, which was previously identified from L. acidophilus and had activity only to gram-positive bacteria, whereas OR-7 had activity to a gram-negative bacterium. Bacteriocin activity was stable following exposure to 90 degrees C for 15 min, also consistent with these types of antibacterial peptides. The purified protein was encapsulated in polyvinylpyrrolidone and added to chicken feed. Ten day-of-hatch chicks were placed in each of nine isolation units; two groups of birds were challenged with each of four C. jejuni isolates (one isolate per unit). At 7 days of age, one group of birds was treated with bacteriocin-emended feed for 3 days, and one group was left untreated. At 10 days of age, the birds were sacrificed and the challenge strain was enumerated from the bird cecal content. Bacteriocin treatment consistently reduced colonization at least one millionfold compared with levels found in the untreated groups. Nonchallenged birds were never colonized by C. jejuni. Bacteriocin from L. salivarius NRRL B-30514 appears potentially very useful to reduce C. jejuni in poultry prior to processing.
TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Characterisation of prototype Nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and PCR-DGGE.
AB  - Undefined Nurmi-type cultures (NTCs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. Such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. These cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. Due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. In this study, 10 batches of prototype NTCs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. Traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), were applied to characterise these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the NTCs were identical. Culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology, Gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (API, BioMerieux, France). Two sets of PCR-DGGE studies were performed. These involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16S rRNA gene by PCR. Resultant amplicons were subjected to DGGE. Sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant DGGE profiles using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Pediococcus and Enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, Capnocytophaga, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus, Eubacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pectobacterium and Pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the NTCs using universal PCR-DGGE analysis. A number of the sequences detected by LAB-specific PCR-DGGE were homologous to those of a number of Lactobacillus spp., including L. fermentum, L. pontis, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, L. casei, L. suntoryeus, L. vaginalis, L. gasseri, L. aviaries, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. mucosae in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. While NTCs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of Lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the NTC cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. PCR-DGGE proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. In conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or PCR-DGGE alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of NTCs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. Moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype NTCs during their development, PCR-DGGE overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. This study demonstrated that PCR-DGGE is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various NTCs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during NTC production.
TI  - [Study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  - A comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. At physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) CFU/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) CFU/1 g in the intestine content. The spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. Quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. Quantity of E. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) CFU/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) CFU/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) CFU/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. Lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--L. plantarum and L. fermentum. All the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. Twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. The degree of adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. The highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in Enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. The screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. The strain of Lactobacillus plantarum 200D proved to be the most active one. A complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. The biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.
TI  - Viability of vaginal probiotic lactobacilli during refrigerated and frozen storage.
AB  - The viability of six different strains of probiotic vaginal Lactobacillus was examined in two different cryoprotective media, during refrigerated versus frozen storage, and using two traditional types of stock cultures for starting the biomass production. Freezing at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C had much less adverse effect on viability than did storage at 7 degrees C, and the reduction in viability was greater at -20 degrees C than at -70 degrees C. The strains showed variation in the extent of the viability losses during both types of storage. Milk-yeast extract (MYE) was shown to be the more suitable protective medium to maintain viability of the strains during the storage. The vaginal Lactobacillus strains are most stable in MYE at -70 degrees C with only a small decrease of the viability observed under these conditions. The viable cell counts of Lactobacillus paracasei CRL 1251 and CRL 1289, L. crispatus CRL 1266 and L. salivarius CRL 1328 remained around 1 x 10(8) CFU/mL after 24 months of storage at -70 degrees C, or up to 18 months for L. acidophilus CRL 1259.
TI  - Effects of sonic energy on monospecific biofilms of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro differential effect of sonic energy, delivered  by Sonicare Advance, on cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria biofilms. METHODS: A wild strain of Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella alcalescens was isolated from human dental plaque. For each of the four microorganisms a biofilm adherent to bovine enamel disks, coated with artificial saliva, was obtained. Biofilms were divided into four groups and were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by Sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. The distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. A colorimetric technique (MTT assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy. RESULTS: ANOVA results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of S. mutans and S. salivarius adherent to the disks, while L. acidophilus and V. alcalescens seemed to remain basically unaffected. In the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while S. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, S. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to Sonicare.
TI  - Anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. Preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of Myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against S. mutans. The anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of M. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1D-NMR, 2D-NMR and EI-MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of macelignan against S. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. Macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei in the MIC range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. In particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated S. mutans in 1 min. The specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.
TI  - Use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral Lactobacillus species.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The genus Lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. A considerable heterogeneity among Lactobacillus species has been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rRNA (16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for the identification of 13 reference strains of Lactobacillus. METHODS: The 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified by PCR using universal primers and digestion of PCR products with the restriction endonucleases, HpaII and HaeIII. The 16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating Lactobacillus strains to species level. Seventy-seven Lactobacillus isolates from a Thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. RESULTS: PCR-RFLP alone had limitations, because the RFLP patterns of Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus and of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by SDS-PAGE. Of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as L. rhamnosus, 5 as Lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as L. casei, 3 as L. acidophilus and 1 as Lactobacillus plantarum. CONCLUSION: 16S rRNA gene PCR-RFLP, using HpaII and HaeIII, together with SDS-PAGE protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral Lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of Lactobacillus to dental caries.
TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - [Antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. DESIGN: review of literature. SETTING: Charles University at Prague, Pharmaceutical Faculty at Hradec Kralove. METHODS: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. CONCLUSIONS: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. The efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of C. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. Essential oils present in the Cayenne pepper (Capsodum frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against C. albicans as well. Clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. The effects of Chinese leek are similar to garlic. Propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the yeast strains decreases in the following order: C. albicans > C. tropicalis > C. crusei > C. guilliermondii. Its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. Tea trea oil (Melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of Candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for C. crusei and C. norvengensis. In the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of Lactobacilus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14, B-54 may be recommended. Moreover there are suitable strains of L. brevis CD-2, L. salivarius FV-2, L. gasseri MB 335, L. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (L. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (L. gasseri). The strains of L. acidophilus CRL 1294 and L. salivarius CRL 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with Candida. It should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of Lactobacillus (especially L. casei and L. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract. No protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin E, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.
TI  - Effect of some pharmaceutical excipients on the survival of probiotic vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacilli are the predominant microorganisms of the vaginal bacterial microbiota, and they play a major role in the maintenance of a healthy urogenital tract. In consequence, the interest in their potential use as probiotics has significantly increased during the last decade. In the present study we assessed the influence of different excipients on the survival of 4 probiotic vaginal lactobacilli incorporated into glycerinated gelatin ovules and stored at 5 degrees C for 60 d. Results showed that viability after storage was a strain-dependent characteristic, but inclusion of ascorbic acid significantly increased survival in 3 of the 4 strains tested. The best survival was observed for Lactobacillus salivarius CRL 1328 in ovules containing skimmed milk. No significant differences in viability were observed between control ovules (glycerogelatin base without excipients) and those containing lactose or Tween 80 for any of the strains tested. Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1259 and Lactobacillus crispatus CRL 1266 were, respectively, the most resistant and sensitive strains to the storage with the different substances. In conclusion, these results provide a basis for selecting excipients to improve the survival of lactobacilli in a probiotic product, in an attempt to ensure the delivery of an adequate number of viable cells to the urogenital tract.
TI  - Susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  - Samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. Lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. Fifty-eight Lactobacillus isolates were identified as L. gasseri, L. vaginalis, L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii spp. lactis, L. crispatus, L. plantarum, L. cellobiosus, L. jensenii, L. salivarius, L. curvatus, L. brevis and L. oris. The inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 Lactobacillus spp. and Candida albicans (AJD 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. Although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on C. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on Lactobacillus isolates. The natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different generation dentin-bonding systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of different generation dentin-bonding systems. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The antibacterial activities of dentin-bonding systems Optibond FL Primer, Single Bond, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-L-Pop were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Cervitec (1% chlorhexidine varnish) was also examined as a positive control material. Disk diffusion tests with filter paper disks (n = 10) containing a drop of each material (20 microL) were used. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 hours, the growth inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. RESULTS: Of all the materials tested, Optibond FL Primer, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-LPop showed larger growth inhibition zones than the control material for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Single Bond. The results indicated that Optibond FL Primer had the strongest effect against the S mutans and L casei, and Clearfil SE Bond Primer produced the largest inhibition zone for S salivarius and L acidophilus among the test materials. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effects observed for the tested different generation dentin-bonding systems may be related to the acidic nature of the materials.
TI  - Effects of the administration of Lactobacilli on body growth and on the metabolic profile in growing Maltese goat kids.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of some lactobacilli on body growth and on the metabolic-nutritional status in growing goat kids. Twenty growing Maltese goat kids (10 Control and 10 Bios) were studied. The animals of the Bios group received a concentrate including 1 g x kg(-1) of SEB Bovino (spray-dried), Akron S.r.l., Italy, with non bacterial components: gum arabic, soybean meal, silicate alum of magnesium, and with bacterial components: 10(11) cfu kg(-1) each of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus reuteri. Monthly, bio-metric and weight evaluations were carried out on each animal and individual blood samples were taken. The Bios group showed the highest body weight (Control 19 vs. Bios 23 kg P < 0.001), anamorphosis (Control 71 vs. Bios 78 P < 0.05) and body proportion (Control 35 vs. Bios 41 P < 0.001) indices; the lowest levels of Non Esterified Fatty Acids (Control 0.778 vs. Bios 0.403 mmol L(-1) P < 0.001), triglycerides (Control 0.21 vs. Bios 0.18 mmol L(-1) P < 0.05), urea (Control 8.83 vs. Bios 7.65 mmol L(-1) P < 0.05) and the highest levels of Alkaline Phosphatase (Control 270 vs. Bios 851 U L(-1) P < 0.01) and Creatine Kinase (Control 173 vs. Bios 285 U L(-1) P < 0.01). The results testify to the better metabolic activity of the Bios group which achieved, at the end of the trial (7 months old), about 99% of the morphological development of the adult, therefore an adequate structure for mating and going into production within the first year of life.
TI  - Two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy FA from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy FA. Two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. Two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(S)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(S)-OH 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10,13-OH 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including L. casei subsp. casei, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-OH 18:1). Seven strains of L. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-OH 18:0) through 10-OH 18:1. Linoleic acid at 2 g/L was converted by L. acidophilus IFO13951T to 1.3 g of 13(S)-OH 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-OH 18:0 in 7 d. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 1111 produced 10-OH 18:1 in 91% yield, and L. plantarum JCM 8341, 10-OH 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/L) under optimal conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of 13(S)-OH 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria, and of 10,13-OH 18:0 by any bacteria.
TI  - Detection and identification of Lactobacillus species in crops of broilers of different ages by using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis.
AB  - The microflora of the crop was investigated throughout the broiler production period (0 to 42 days) using PCR combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and selective bacteriological culture of lactobacilli followed by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). The birds were raised under conditions similar to those used in commercial broiler production. Lactobacilli predominated and attained populations of 10(8) to 10(9) CFU per gram of crop contents. Many of the lactobacilli present in the crop (61.9% of isolates) belonged to species of the Lactobacillus acidophilus group and could not be differentiated by PCR-DGGE. A rapid and simple ARDRA method was developed to distinguish between the members of the L. acidophilus group. HaeIII-ARDRA was used for preliminary identification of isolates in the L. acidophilus group and to identify Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus salivarius. MseI-ARDRA generated unique patterns for all species of the L. acidophilus group, identifying Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Lactobacillus gallinarum among crop isolates. The results of our study provide comprehensive knowledge of the Lactobacillus microflora in the crops of birds of different ages using nucleic acid-based methods of detection and identification based on current taxonomic criteria.
TI  - The effect of temperature and pH on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a pH-auxostat study.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a pH-auxostat. The computer-controlled smooth change of pH or temperature was used to study the effect of pH and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield Y(ATP) and specific lactate production rate Q(ATP)). The behaviour of mu and Q(ATP) with an increase of temperature suggested that ATP production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The decrease of Y(ATP) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while Q(ATP) remained constant or even increased. With the decrease of pH, decrease of both Y(ATP) and Q(ATP) was observed. S. thermophilus St20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees C was the most acid sensitive strain. The L. paracasei E1H3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to pH change. The behaviour of mixed culture of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus in milk in a pH-auxostat with pH-decrease was in agreement with the pure culture experiments of the same species. The study showed that pH-auxostat with smooth controlled change of pH and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of LAB.
TI  - Influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  - Intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. The stimulus of the mucosal immunity is not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. In previous works we have demonstrated that some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. Taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis on the IgA secreting cells associated to bronchus. As shown before, oral immunostimulation with LAB induced an increase of the IgA* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. In this study it is also showed that the LAB assayed, with exception of L. acidophilus, were able to enhance IgA+ cells at bronchial level, being also this effect dose dependent. The increment induced by some LAB in the number of IgA+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be very important to prevent bronchus diseases.
TI  - Impact of two probiotic Lactobacillus strains feeding on fecal lactobacilli and weight gains in chicken.
AB  - Two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus agilis JCM 1048 and L. salivarius subsp. salicinius JCM 1230 isolated from chicken intestine, exhibited probiotic characteristics that can be applied for chicken production. After 7 days of probiotic feeding (FD7), the count of intestinal lactobacilli in the probiotic group (group P, n=10) was significantly (p<0.05) higher than that in the control group (group C, n=9). After 40 days of probiotic feeding (FD40), the lactobacilli and enterococci counts were stable but the Enterobacteriaceae number was significantly reduced (p<0.05). A total of 163 isolated lactobacilli were identified as the L. acidophilus/gallinarum group (49.7%), L. agilis (30.7%), L. salivarius (9.2%), L. reuteri (9.2%), and Lactobacillus spp. (1.2%). The probiotic lactobacilli positively affected the Lactobacillus biota in chickens at FD7, with a significant increase in the number (p<0.05) of L. agilis and group P. The viable counts of each Lactobacillus species at FD40, however, showed no differences between two groups. An increasing incidence of L. agilis was also noted with probiotic feeding. The probiotic effect of two strains resulted in significantly increased weight gains (10.7%) of group P in comparison with group C at FD40 (p<0.01).
TI  - Isolation, selection, and characterization of lactic acid bacteria for a competitive exclusion product to reduce shedding of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cattle.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were selected on the basis of characteristics indicating that they would be good candidates for a competitive exclusion product (CEP) that would inhibit Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the intestinal tract of live cattle. Fecal samples from cattle that were culture negative for E. coli O157:H7 were collected. LAB were isolated from cattle feces by repeated plating on deMan Rogosa Sharpe agar and lactobacillus selection agar. Six hundred eighty-six pure colonies were isolated, and an agar spot test was used to test each isolate for its inhibition of a four-strain mixture of E. coli O157:H7. Three hundred fifty-five isolates (52%) showed significant inhibition. Seventy-five isolates showing maximum inhibition were screened for acid and bile tolerance. Most isolates were tolerant of acid at pH levels of 2, 4, 5, and 7 and at bile levels of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3% (oxgall) and were subsequently identified with the API system. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus delbreukii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Leuconostoc spp., and Pediococcus acidilactici were the most commonly identified LAB. Nineteen strains were further tested for antibiotic resistance and inhibition of E. coli O157:H7 in manure and rumen fluid. Four of these 19 strains showed susceptibility to all of the antibiotics, 13 significantly reduced E. coli counts in manure, and 15 significantly reduced E. coli counts in rumen fluid (P < 0.05) during at least one of the sampling periods. One of the strains, M35, was selected as the best candidate for a CEP. A 16S rRNA sequence analysis of M35 revealed its close homology to Lactobacillus crispatus. The CEP developed will be used in cattle-feeding trials.
TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli: self- and co-aggregating ability.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are the dominant bacteria of the vaginal tract in healthy women. Lactobacillus species form a barrier population that protects from pathogen colonisation by mechanisms that include adhesion to epithelial surfaces, self-aggregation and co-aggregation. In this study, factors involved in the self-aggregating ability of vaginal lactobacilli and in the co-aggregation of these microorganisms with Candida spp. are studied. Both self-aggregation and co-aggregation are monitored quantitatively by the decrease in the absorbance of suspensions of the microorganisms and qualitatively by light microscopy. The self-aggregating ability of four vaginal lactobacilli was shown to be caused by a peptide or protein sensitive to trypsin. However, in self-aggregating Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 1294 the factor was resistant to trypsin and sensitive to pepsin. Among self-aggregating lactobacilli, L. acidophilus CRL 1294 and L. salivarius CRL 1328 were able to co-aggregate with Candida spp. The co-aggregating factor for both strains proved to be peptide of the surface and a peptide on the bacterial surface, while the receptor on the yeast was a carbohydrate. Co-aggregation of both lactobacilli and Candida spp. was inhibited by the addition of mannose but was not affected by other carbohydrates. Self and co-aggregation factors were not able to induce aggregation in non-aggregating lactobacilli.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - Probiotics and Helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB  - The need for new strategies for Helicobacter pylori eradication, alternative or complementary to antibiotic therapy, has recently claimed the attention of many investigators. Pre-clinical studies have shown the inhibition of Helicobacter pylori growth by Lactobacilli and the anti-Helicobacter pylori action of Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus strains, possibly due to the production of lactic acid or to the secretion of an autolysin. Clinical studies have demonstrated a persistent reduction in delta over baseline values at the 13C urea breath test independently of omeprazole administration with Lactobacillus acidophilus La1, the eradication in 6 out of 14 patients with Lactobacillus acidophilus alone, positive results in patients in which a standard Helicobacter pylori triple therapy was randomly supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of cecal microbiota in chicken by the use of 16S rDNA clone libraries.
AB  - The chicken cecum contains a great many bacteria, most of which are strict anaerobes. A strictly anaerobe culture-based method was used in the present study, in conjunction with the 16S rDNA clone library, to elucidate bacterial diversity and the phylogenetic relationship of cecal microbiota in the chicken. A comparative 16S rDNA sequence analysis of cultivated strains and retrieved clones from cecal contents was performed. Approximately 90% of the bacterial cells detected by microscopy did not form colonies on a medium 10 in plate-in-bottle. The 19 isolated strains yielded 11 distinct rDNA sequences, 58% of which were classified as low G + C gram-positive bacteria, 26% were related to Bacteroides spp., and 16% were classified as Proteobacteria. Based on the sequence analysis of 164 clones, 24% were identified to belong to 8 known species and 76% were considered to be 65 novel phylotypes. Approximately 94% of cloned sequences were classified into low G + C gram-positive bacteria, 4% were related to Bacteroides spp., and 2% were classified into Proteobacteria. Clostridium subcluster XIVa (38%), Clostridium cluster IV (13%), Lactobacillus spp. (24%), and Bacteroides spp. (4%) were the major groups constituting the cecal microbiota in chicken, in which the Clostridium subcluster XIVa was the most phylogenetically diverse group in chicken cecum. The 16S rDNA sequences of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, and L. reuteri were the most frequently found in the Lactobacillus group in chicken cecum.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Characterisation of IS153, an IS3-family insertion sequence isolated from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  - An insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451T as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfA and orfB, from which three putative proteins are produced. OrfAB is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf A and orf B that is presumed to be the transposase. The large orfAB of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS3 family. In L. sanfranciscensis type strain DSM 20451T multiple truncated IS elements were identified. Inverse PCR was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly AT rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. Moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. Multiple copies of IS153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of L. sanfranciscensis. Resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16S rDNA. With a PCR based approach IS153 or highly similar sequences were detected in L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. malefermentans, L. plantarum, L. hilgardii, L. collinoides L. farciminis L. sakei and L. salivarius, L. reuteri as well as in Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Probiotics in foods not containing milk or milk constituents, with special reference to Lactobacillus plantarum 299v.
AB  - Lactic acid fermentation is the simplest and safest way of preserving food and has probably always been used by humans. Species such as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus salivarius are common in the human mucosa, from the mouth to the rectum. In food, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus are usually associated with dairy products whereas L. plantarum is found in fermented foods of plant origin. A probiotic food product containing no milk constituent was launched in Sweden in 1994. The product is a lactic acid fermented oatmeal gruel that is mixed in a fruit drink. It contains approximately 5 x 10(10) colony-forming units of L. plantarum 299v/L. The strain L. plantarum 299v originates from the human intestinal mucosa and has been shown in rats to decrease translocation, improve mucosal status, improve liver status, improve the immunologic status of the mucosa, and reduce mucosal inflammation. In humans, L. plantarum 299v can increase the concentration of carboxylic acids in feces and decrease abdominal bloating in patients with irritable bowel disease. It can also decrease fibrinogen concentrations in blood. Should probiotics be administrated through foods, the probiotic organism must remain vigorous in the food until consumption and the food must remain palatable, ie, the food carrier and the organism must suit each other. L. plantarum 299v not only affects the bacterial flora of the intestinal mucosa but may also regulate the host's immunologic defense. The mechanisms involved need to be clarified.
TI  - Rapid identification of 11 human intestinal Lactobacillus species by multiplex PCR assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23S rRNA.
AB  - Rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex PCR was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex PCR assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. Primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23S rRNA gene of members of the genus Lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). The established two-step multiplex PCR assays were applied to the identification of 84 Lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the PCR results were consistent with the results from the DNA-DNA hybridization assay. These results suggest that the multiplex PCR system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common Lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.
TI  - Probiotic culture survival and implications in fermented frozen yogurt characteristics.
AB  - Low-fat ice cream mix was fermented with probiotic-supplemented and traditional starter culture systems and evaluated for culture survival, composition, and sensory characteristics of frozen product. Fermentations were stopped when the titratable acidity reached 0.15% greater than the initial titratable acidity (end point 1) or when the pH reached 5.6 (end point 2). Mix was frozen and stored for 11 wk at -20 degrees C. The traditional yogurt culture system contained the strains Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. The probiotic-supplemented system contained the traditional cultures as well as Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. We compared recovery of Bifodobacterium by three methods, a repair-detection system with roll-tubes and plates on modified bifid glucose medium and plates with maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial medium. Culture bacteria in both systems did not decrease in the yogurt during frozen storage. The roll-tube method with modified bifid glucose agar and repair detection system provided at least one-half log10 cfu/ml higher recovery of B. longum compared with recoveries using modified bifid glucose agar or maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial agar on petri plates. No change in concentrations of lactose or protein for products fermented with either culture system occurred during storage. Acid flavor was more intense when product was fermented to pH 5.6, but yogurt flavor was not intensified. The presence of probiotic bacteria in the supplemented system seemed to cause no differences in protein and lactose concentration and sensory characteristics.
TI  - Quantification of micro-organisms in binary mixed populations by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.
AB  - Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used for the first time to determine the ratios of different microorganisms in mixtures. Exemplarily, systems composed of two food-associated yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae/Hanseniaspora uvarum) and two yoghurt lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus/Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) were investigated. Determination of the cell number ratio in the lactic acid bacteria system was possible with a minimal prediction accuracy of +/- 16 ratio percentage points while the minimum accuracy of prediction in the yeast two-component system was +/- 4% (both at a 95% confidence level). These results show that FT-IR spectroscopy is potentially a rapid method for the quantification of cell ratios in mixtures of two different microorganisms, provided that the cell ratio does not drop below a certain, system-specific threshold.
TI  - Lactobacillus flora in the cloaca and vagina of hens and its inhibitory activity  against Salmonella enteritidis in vitro.
AB  - Lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of 40 normal laying hens were investigated  quantitatively and qualitatively, and their ability to inhibit growth of Salmonella enteritidis (SE) was examined using a spot-the-lawn technique. All samples of cloacal contents and half the samples of vaginal mucus were positive for lactobacilli. The means +/- SD of total Lactobacillus counts in the cloaca and those in the vagina were log10 5.5 +/- 1.1 and 2.5 +/- 2.6 cfu/g, respectively. In the cloaca, Lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated from 92.5% of hens, and Lactobacillus salivarius was isolated from 85.0% of hens, whereas Lactobacillus fermentum was isolated from only one hen. In the vagina, L. acidophilus and L. salivarius were isolated from 42.5% of hens. In the inhibition assay in vitro, all strains of Lactobacillus from cloacal contents and vaginal mucus inhibited growth of SE. There was a wide range of the inhibitory activity even in the same species. No difference of the growth inhibition zone was observed between lactobacilli from cloaca and those from vagina. The present study suggested that lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of hens might have a protective effect against SE colonization.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacillus species of human origin by a commercial kit, API50CHL.
AB  - The efficacy of a biochemical kit, API50CHL kit, for identification of intestinal and vaginal lactobacilli from humans was evaluated by comparing with the results of DNA-DNA hybridization assay. The results showed that in total only 52 of the 172 strains (30.2%) tested were identified correctly by the kit at species level. Especially all strains of some species, such as Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus crispatus, were misidentified as Lactobacillus acidophilus by the kit. However, the kit was found to be reliable for identification of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. This suggests that the exact identification of Lactobacillus isolates from human stool and vaginal specimens by API50CHL kit is difficult without the support of modern genotypic technique.
TI  - Phylogeny of the defined murine microbiota: altered Schaedler flora.
AB  - The "altered Schaedler flora" (ASF) was developed for colonizing germfree rodents with a standardized microbiota. The purpose of this study was to identify each of the eight ASF strains by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Three strains were previously identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain ASF 360), Lactobacillus salivarius (strain ASF 361), and Bacteroides distasonis (strain ASF 519) based on phenotypic criteria. 16S rRNA analysis indicated that each of the strains differed from its presumptive identity. The 16S rRNA sequence of strain ASF 361 is essentially identical to the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of Lactobacillus murinis and Lactobacillus animalis (both isolated from mice), and all of these strains probably belong to a single species. Strain ASF 360 is a novel lactobacillus that clusters with L. acidophilus and Lactobacillus lactis. Strain ASF 519 falls into an unnamed genus containing [Bacteroides] distasonis, [Bacteroides] merdae, [Bacteroides] forsythus, and CDC group DF-3. This unnamed genus is in the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum and is most closely related to the genus Porphyromonas. The spiral-shaped strain, strain ASF 457, is in the Flexistipes phylum and exhibits sequence identity with rodent isolates of Robertson. The remaining four ASF strains, which are extremely oxygen-sensitive fusiform bacteria, group phylogenetically with the low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes, Bacillus-Clostridium group). ASF 356, ASF 492, and ASF 502 fall into Clostridium cluster XIV of Collins et al. Morphologically, ASF 492 resembles members of this cluster, Roseburia cecicola, and Eubacterium plexicaudatum. The 16S rRNA sequence of ASF 492 is identical to that of E. plexicaudatum. Since the type strain and other viable original isolates of E. plexicaudatum have been lost, strain ASF 492 is a candidate for a neotype strain. Strain ASF 500 branches deeply in the low-G+C-content gram-positive phylogenetic tree but is not closely related to any organisms whose 16S rRNA sequences are currently in the GenBank database. The 16S rRNA sequence information determined in the present study should allow rapid identification of ASF strains and should permit detailed analysis of the interactions of ASF organisms during development of intestinal disease in mice that are coinfected with a variety of pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of Bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  - Pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis and Bif. bifidum), Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. The appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. Of the selective media, AMC, RMS, NPNL and BL-OG performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lact. acidophilus. However, of these four media, AMC was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. The AMC agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with ducks.
AB  - The diversity of lactic acid bacteria occurring in the crop and intestinal content of ducks of different ages (5 to 34 days) was evaluated using the RAPD-PCR technique and comparative sequence analysis of 16S rRNA. Cluster analysis derived from isolates grown on Rogosa agar used for the enrichment of lactic acid bacteria, revealed at least twenty six different groups of organisms representing species, subspecies and strains belonging to Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, Weissella and Lactobacillus. Homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli were identified, belonging to the phylogenetically defined Lb. acidophilus, Lb. salivarius and Lb. reuteri groups.
TI  - Lactic acid-mediated suppression of Helicobacter pylori by the oral administration of Lactobacillus salivarius as a probiotic in a gnotobiotic murine model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We examined whether or not the lactobacilli administered to treat Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection can suppress the colonization of H. pylori, and we also sought to elucidate the mechanism of such suppression. METHODS: We used an in vitro culture system and an H. pylori-infected gnotobiotic murine model. RESULTS: Among the lactobacillus species examined in vitro, Lactobacillus salivarius (L. salivarius) but not L. casei or L. acidophilus proved to be capable of producing a high amount of lactic acid and thus completely inhibiting the growth of H. pylori in a mixed culture. The validity of L. salivarius as a probiotic to suppress H. pylori and thus reduce the inflammatory response was again confirmed in vivo by using an H. pylori-infected gnotobiotic murine model. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, L. salivarius was found to be a potentially effective probiotic against H. pylori.
TI  - Acid production from lactulose by dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final pH recorded. Most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. fermentum. Streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. Plaque pH was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or Lactulose BP. These studies in vivo showed both lactulose and Lactulose BP to exhibit low acidogenic potential. Thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.
TI  - Lactobacilli counts in crop, ileum and caecum of growing broiler chickens fed on  practical diets containing whole or dehulled sweet lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) seed meal.
AB  - 1. Four experiments with growing broiler chickens were carried out to study the effects of the inclusion in their diets of lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) seed meal of E. coli and lactobacilli counts in crop, ileum and caecca at 3 or 4 weeks of age. 2. Diets were formulated to contain the same amounts of metabolisable energy (12.55 MJ/kg) and protein (210 g/kg). Raw whole (heat-untreated) or dehulled sweet (low in alkaloids) lupin seed meal (400 and 320 g/kg respectively) were used to prepare the lupin-based diets, whose protein content was completed with either defatted soyabean meal or casein. 3. Final body weight and food intake of chickens fed on whole lupin seed meal diets were lower than controls, but gain: food ratios were not different. However, birds given the diet with dehulled lupin seed meal had similar body weight, food intake and gain: food values as those of controls. 4. While E. coli counts were not affected, lactobacilli numbers were consistently increased compared to controls in all intestinal sections of chickens fed on the whole or dehulled lupin-based diets, irrespective of the age of the birds or the presence of soyabean meal or casein in the diet. The lactobacilli species isolated were: Lactobacillus fermentum, L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. brevis. 5. The results suggest that the use of whole or dehulled sweet lupin seed meal in diets for growing broilers might enhance the growth of lactic acid--fermenting bacteria in the gut.
TI  - Homofermentative Lactobacillus species predominantly isolated from canine feces.
AB  - Lactobacillus salivarius group biovars VIa and VIb, which are homofermentative Lactobacillus, were predominantly isolated from canine feces. Identification and biotyping of L. salivarius group biovars VIa and VIb were originally done by Mitsuoka et al. (1976). These strains were tentatively identified as L. salivarius by their phenotypic characteristics. They are, however, more similar to those of some new Lactobacillus species, particularly L. animalis and L. murinus, than those of L. salivarius and have now been identified as L. animalis by DNA-DNA homology.
TI  - The lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Pediococcus and Leuconostoc species, L. helveticus, L. acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. The lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal pH and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. The cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. In the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). By contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. The presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. No doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. Meanwhile the obtention of a Lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified PL1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of L. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.
TI  - [A microflora study of the gastrointestinal tract of mink housed within and outside of the area of the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Station].
AB  - Quantitative differences in the content of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the content of the stomach, small and large intestine have been established when studying microflora of the gastrointestinal tract of minks kept in the 30-kilometer zone of the Chernobyl NPP (experimental animals) and at the Cherkassy fur farm (control animals). Obligate heterofermentative species of lactic acid bacteria related to Lactobacillus fermentum and L. reuteri prevailed in the stomach of experimental minks. Species composition of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the stomach of the Cherkassy minks is characterized by the availability of both obligate and facultative heterofermentative species of bacteria--L. bavaricus, L. coryniformis, L. reuteri and of obligate homofermentative bacteria--L. salivarius and L. jensenii. In limiting dilutions (10(-9)-10(-10)) of the content of small intestine of the control minks one could find bacteria of L. coryniformis species and representatives of obligate heterofermentative bacteria--L. confusus and L. fermentum that is 1-2 orders higher then in the experimental minks. Both lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria (the latter up to 10(+9) cells/g of the content) were isolated from the lower departments of small and large intestine of the Chernobyl and Cherkassy minks. Among the species of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the experimental animals homofermentative species (L. acidophilus, L. sharpeae) and, heterofermentative (L. confusus, L. fermentum) in the control were found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Enzyme production by lactobacilli and the potential link with infective endocarditis.
AB  - Fifty-six strains of lactobacilli were examined for the production of glycosidases and proteases (arylamidases) that could be associated with the ability to grow in vivo and/or be a factor in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. The strains were from seven species, with an emphasis on Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, both of which have been associated with endocarditis and provided 12 of the 13 strains isolated from cases of the disease. Other species were Lact. acidophilus, Lact. plantarum, Lact. salivarius, Lact. fermentum and Lact. oris. Commonly expressed glycosidase activities were alpha-D-galactosidase and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase followed by beta-D-glucosidase and alpha-L-fucosidase. The combined production of beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase and alpha-D-galactosidase was a feature of the endocarditis isolates. In contrast, beta-D-galactosidase was produced by very few of the strains within species implicated in endocarditis but most of the strains of Lact. salivarius, Lact. fermentum and Lact. oris. The most commonly produced arylamidases active against substrates employed for testing human blood clotting cascade were activated protein C(Ca)-like, activated factor X(Xa)-like and Hageman factor-like followed by kallikrein-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimutagenicity of fermented milk.
AB  - Reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus CH65, Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CH3, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. The fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA 100) against N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. Dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. Maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine was 2- and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. Extracts of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R were examined further. Compounds that were responsible for activity against both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. Adjustment of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R to pH 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. In contrast, compounds with activity specific for N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at pH 7.6. The weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% L-lactic acid.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - The effect of Lactobacillus spp. on the attachment of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli to isolated porcine enterocytes.
AB  - A total of 43 strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of piglets at the time of weaning. Isolates, grown on solid media, were allocated to strongly adherent or non/weakly adherent groups on the basis of numbers attaching to isolated porcine enterocytes. Strains of Lactobacillus fermentum were disproportionally represented amongst the strongly-adherent strains and Lact. acidophilus and Lact. salivarius amongst the non/weakly-adherent group. Lactobacilli showed significantly better attachment ability when grown on agar than when grown in broth culture. Strongly adherent strains were not found to effect the attachment of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli to porcine enterocytes, tested under the conditions of exclusion (lactobacilli added to the enterocytes before E. coli), competition (lactobacilli and E. coli added simultaneously) and displacement (E. coli added before lactobacilli). Tests were made with [14C]-labelled E. coli. Suspensions of bacteria and enterocytes were passed through a filter selected to retain enterocytes but pass free bacterial cells. Counts (dpm) obtained from filters after solubilization were taken as a measure of E. coli attachment. Some strains of lactobacilli coaggregated with enterotoxigenic E. coli with K88 fimbriae, but not with a K88-negative mutants strain. These were excluded from the competitive exclusion experiments. In the apparent absence of a direct effect on the association of E. coli with host tissue, removal of potential gut pathogens by aggregation could contribute to the probiotic properties ascribed to lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli: preliminary characterization and optimization of production of acidocin B, a novel bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus M46.
AB  - Approximately 1000 lactobacillus strains were isolated and screened for the production of antimicrobial activity, using a target panel of spoilage organisms and pathogens. Only eight positive strains were found; two of these were studied in more detail. Lactobacillus salivarius M7 produces the new broad spectrum bacteriocin salivaricin B which inhibits the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Enterococcus faecalis and many lactobacilli. A new atypical bacteriocin produced by Lact. acidophilus M46, acidocin B, combines the inhibition of Clostridium sporogenes with a very narrow activity spectrum within the genus Lactobacillus and was selected for further characterization. Acidocin B is sensitive to trypsin, heat-stable (80 degrees C for 20 min) and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluid with butanol. Native acidocin B occurs as a large molecular weight complex (100 kDa), while with SDS-PAGE the partly purified activity migrates as a peptide of 2.4 kDa. Optimization of the cultivation conditions resulted in an eightfold increase of the amount of acidocin B produced during growth. Growth is not necessary for acidocin B production; washed producer cells can synthesize the bacteriocin in a chemically defined production medium. The application potential of acidocin B is discussed.
TI  - The aggregation of human platelets by Lactobacillus species.
AB  - The ability to aggregate human platelets was examined for five Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains and five Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei strains isolated from patients with infective endocarditis (IE), 25 laboratory isolates from the same two species, and 14 strains from five other oral species, namely Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus oris, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus salivarius. Amongst the L. rhamnosus strains, platelets were aggregated by all five IE strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. For the L. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains, the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. Aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains of the other five species; each species was represented. The optimal ratio of bacteria to platelets for aggregation was approximately 1:1, and there was considerable variation in the lag phase that preceded aggregation, depending on the source of the platelets. Overall, the lag phase varied between 0.25 +/- 0.1 and 20.4 +/- 3.2 min and the percentage aggregation ranged between 70 +/- 2.6 and 104 +/- 13.5%. Confirmation that aggregation was being observed came from studies with five strains on the inhibitory effects of EDTA, dipyridamole, apyrase, imipramine, acetylsalicylic acid and quinacrine. Inhibition of aggregation by L. rhamnosus strains by the peptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (RGDS) further indicated a role for fibronectin and/or fibrinogen. Pronase treatment of cells for 1 h and extraction of bacterial surface components with 0.1 M-Tris/HCl (pH 8.5) at 37 degrees C for 1 h stopped aggregation in 8/9 IE strains. Extracted surface proteins (200 micrograms) completely inhibited platelet aggregation by 8/9 of the homologous strains.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured Indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  - Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus laterosporus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. The effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. This study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  - Two-hundred and fifty Lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. Data were processed by the Jaccard (SJ) and Simple Matching (SSM) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. Seventeen major clusters were defined at the 76% SJ-similarity level which approximately correspond to the SSM-level of 91%. Seven clusters could be identified: Lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), Lact. buchneri (4% of patients), Lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and Lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). Unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains. Cluster 1 included the type strains of Lact. crispatus, Lact. acidophilus, Lact. jensenii and Lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lact. agilis and Lact. casei subsp. tolerans. Clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. Unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. No obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. Most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. Exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. Cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the respiratory tracts in chickens with a particular reference to Lactobacillus species.
AB  - The effects of three different types of breeding such as isolator, floor, and cage breedings on the bacterial flora of the respiratory tracts (nasal cavity, tongue, pharygolarynx, trachea and air sac) in chickens were determined. Total viable bacterial numbers on the nasal mucus of chickens in the isolator breeding as control group (Group A) aged of 14 days were 10(4.6)/g of autopsy specimen (wet weight), 10(5.7)/g of sample in the cage breeding (Group B) aged of 28 days, and 10(7.0)/g of sample in the floor breeding (Group C) aged of 28 days. Staphylococci and micrococci were predominant bacteria in the nasal cavities of all groups. Total viable numbers of tongue and pharygolarynx were from 10(5.4) to 10(6.5)/g of autopsy specimen. Lactobacilli were the predominant bacteria in pharyngolarynx of chickens. The incidence of staphylococci and micrococci in trachea was lower than those in the another regions. Staphylococci and micrococci dominated in the air sacs of two groups (B and C), but the number and incidence of lactobacilli in the air sacs of chickens were lower than those in the another respiratory tracts. The only clostridia isolation in the air sacs of Group A was observed. A total of 75 strains of Lactobacillus species was isoalted from all respiratory organs and intestine of chickens. These strains were divided into 19 groups. Lactobacillus salivearius subsp. salivarius was the predominant lactobacilli isolated from tongue and pharyngolarynx. Most of isolates from the chicken intestines were mainly identified as the L. acidophilus group and L. reuteri.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  - Lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. To evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of S thermophilus, L bulgaricus, L acidophilus, or Bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. Selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. All yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. The response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with B bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with L bulgaricus milk. The results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.
TI  - [Lactic bacteria in the digestive tract of poultry].
AB  - Lactic bacteria predominate in the microflora of the digestive tract of chicken and turkey. They are represented mainly by Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. fermentum and L. buchneri. Streptococcus faecium is always isolated. L. ruminis, L. vitulinus, L. delbrueckii, L. coryniformis and L. viridescens were found in this ecological niche for the first time. S. faecium and S. faecalis prevail in the digestive tract of geese and ducks, while lactobacilli are detected in a lesser amount and are represented mainly by L. plantarum. L. salivarius cells isolated from the digestive tract of poultry are highly polymorphous. Most of the lactic acid bacteria found in the digestive tract of poultry can grow at 45-50 degrees C whatever is the species they belong to.
TI  - An introduction to rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  - The genus Lactobacillus is mainly found in the intestinal tract of healthy humans and animals as well as in fermenting vegetables or plant materials, such as silage. It has a moderate diffusion in meat products and is rarely found in wines and beers. On the other hand, rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria are largely used in the preparation of a variety of foods and feed products. As starter cultures, they are omnipresent in cheeses and dairy manufacturing. Specific fermentation processes have been developed in order to encourage the growth of the desired species, some of which are fastidious organisms such as L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, L. helveticus and L. sanfrancisco. In addition, a promising and interesting perspective is the use of rod-shaped lactic-acid bacteria, primarily L. acidophilus, L. reuteri and L. salivarius as probiotic starters to preserve the natural biological equilibrium of the intestinal tract.
TI  - [Bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  - Considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. Currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. The present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth pattern and acid production of S. mutans, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. faecalis, S. viridans, L. casei and L. acidophilus in vitro by using Photo Electrical Colorimeter and pH meter. In conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.
TI  - Nucleic acids of species of Lactobacillus.
AB  - Nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named Lactobacillus species was studied. Nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic reactions. The overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 X 10(6) daltons. Sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 X 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus Bacillus. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees C below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. The genus can be divided into three major groups, each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. Group I (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus sanfrancisco. Group II (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus brevis, and Group III (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
TI  - [Adhesive properties of lactobacilli isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract].
AB  - The adhesive and hemagglutinating properties of 34 tribes of Lactobacillus have been examined. 21 tribes came from human saliva and feces. 23.5% of the tribes showed strongly, 50% weakly adhesive properties. The remaining tribes showed average effects. Most of the strongly adhering tribes were isolates from human specimens. In the group of weakly adhering tribes those from collections dominated. 4 of 9 examined species differed in their adhering capacity. These were L. acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. casei, and L. fermentum. Only weakly adhering tribes showed hemagglutination of human erythrocytes. Therefore, there exists obviously, a reversed relation between the adhering and the hemagglutinating properties of Lactobacilli.
TI  - Conjugal Transfer of Broad-Host-Range Plasmid pAMbeta1 into Enteric Species of Lactic Acid Bacteria.
AB  - The broad-host-range plasmid pAMbeta1, which codes for erythromycin and lincomycin resistance, was transferred by conjugation into Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus salivarius. A novel 17-megadalton plasmid molecule was detected in the transconjugants, confirming the introduction of pAMbeta1 into each species.
TI  - Influence of dietary lactose on the gut flora of chicks.
AB  - 1. The gut microflora of chicks fed on a purified diet containing 300 g lactose plus 300 g starch/kg was compared with that of control birds receiving a diet containing 600 g starch/kg. 2. In 14-d-old conventional chicks, lactose in the diet decreased the incidence of lactobacilli and clostridia in the caecal contents, although when presenting lactose-fed chicks the counts of lactobacilli exceeded those of control chicks. 3. High counts of Proteus sp. were present in the caeca of control birds but they were completely suppressed in conventional birds fed on the lactose diet. In vitro tests showed that this inhibition was partially due to Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. 4. The growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited by lactose when gnotobiotic chicks were monoassociated but not when polyassociated. The protective effect was shown in vitro to be due to L. salivarius. 5. The pH was markedly lowered in the caecum of conventional and polyassociated chicks receiving dietary lactose. Of the strains used in gnotobiotic experiments E. coli, S. faecalis and L. salivarius produced the lowest pH values in the caeca.
TI  - [Sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus Thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
AB  - Sensitivity of 278 cultures of Thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by L. acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. jugurti, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. It was shown that all cultures of L. Salivarius, L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. leichmannii, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii and 94.1 per cent of L. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. The cultures of L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. jugurti, L. helveticus, L. lactis, L. bulgaricus and L. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.
TI  - Effect of lactobacilli on urinary indican excretion in gnotobiotic rats and in man.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus species on urinary indican excretion in two types of  gnotobiotic rats (GBH-9 and GB-5) and in man was studied. L. salivarius, L. plantarum and L. casei colonized in the cecum and colon of both types of rats at levels of 10(7) to 10(8) per gram of contents following one-dose oral administration and caused a significant reduction in urinary indican excretion, whereas two strains of L. acidophilus which colonized at low levels (10(4) to 10(5)/g) did not reduce indican excretion. Daily feeding of Lactobacillus concentrates caused a further significant reduction in indican excretion which was corrected by tryptophan intake, even in the case of L. acidophilus. There was a clear relationship between fecal lactobacillus counts and urinary indican. A significant reduction of indican secretion was obtained only when the fecal counts of lactobacilli exceeded 10(7).4/g in rats. L. casei also had an effect in man, reducing urinary excretion of indican and p-cresol. Reduction in indican excretion seems to be accompanied by decreasing fecal tryptophanase activity in rats and man. A negative correlation was also obtained between fecal resident lactobacilli and urinary indican in man (r = -0.532, n = 28, p less than 0.01). Subjects with lactobacilli at a level of 10(6)/g or more excreted less indican than those harboring the bacteria at levels below 10(5)/g.
TI  - Bacteria associated with the gastric epithelium of neonatal pigs.
AB  - Light and electron microscopy showed lactobacilli and, to a lesser degree, streptococci to be closely associated with the squamous area of the pig stomach known as the pars esophagea. Several different types of extracellular layers were seen on bacteria attached to the epithelial surface. The total number of bacteria per square centimeter did not change with age up to 10 days, and there was no effect of weaning at 2 days. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. salivarius, and Streptococcus salivarius were isolated more frequently from sucking pigs than from those that were early weaned, whereas the reverse was true of L. acidophilus and S. bovis. All isolates recovered from washed macerated pars esophagea adhered to pig esophageal epithelial cells when tested in vitro.
TI  - Changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  - The gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. Although there was a significantly higher count of Escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. There were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius, S. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. L. fermentum and S. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. The weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there may be gastric stasis. The gastric pH was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. In weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between pH and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and also a positive correlation between pH and number of E. coli. These correlations suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in the regulation of gastric pH in weaned pigs. Three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting HCl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, pH < 3.5). In sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. In weaned scouring pigs there was a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. There was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.
TI  - [Differentiation of several species of lactobacilli of the subgenus Thermobacterium according to their bacteriocin sensitivity spectra].
AB  - The method of retarded antagonism was applied to the study of L. acidophilus (187 cultures), L. salivarius (65 cultures), L. jugurti (16 cultures), L. helveticus (4 cultures) sensitivity to the action of 39 bacteriocines produced by various lactobacilli species. By the sensitivity spectra to bacteriocines L. ecidophilus cultures were divided into 76, L. salivarius--22, L. jugurti--15, and L. helveticus into 2 bacteriocines. By bacteriocine typing it was possible to differentiate into a number of bacteriocine types L. acidophilus and L. salivarius variants with the same biochemical and physiological properties.
TI  - [Studies on the composition of the fecal flora of healthy dogs with the special references of Lactobacillus flora and Bifidobacterium flora (author's transl)].
AB  - With the new method the fecal flora of 13 clinically healthy dogs aged 3 to 42 months was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. It was characterized by that bacteroidaceae constituted the most prodominant flora, catenabacteria, streptococci, peptostreptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were the next most numerous, enterobacteria consisted the accompanying flora. The numbers of Clostridium perfringens were remarkably fluctuated and seem to be influenced by the composition of the food ingested by the host. The total cultivable counts averaged log 10.8 +/- 0.2/g. The composition of the Lactobacillus flora and Bifidobacterium flora in the feces of 34 dogs from 3 different age groups was analysed. In the feces of all age groups L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. fermenti with 9 different types were found. Within the lactobacilli L. acidophilus type VI c, L. salivarius type VI a and L. fermenti type IV b were most frequently found. L. acidophilus types VI c and XI, L. salivarius types VI a and VI b could not be placed in any established types of each species, and were described as new types. Bifidobacteria were regularly found in large numbers in the feces of dogs aged 2 to 24 months. B. adolescentis and B. pseudolongum consisted the main Bifidobacterium flora.
TI  - [Sensitivity of the lactobacilli of the subgenus Streptobacterium to bacteriocins of lactobacilli of different species].
AB  - Sensitivity of 167 cultures of Lactobacilli of Streptobacterium to 39 bacteriocins produced by L. acidophilus, L. jugurti, L. salivarius, L. lactis, L. helveticus, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. fermenti, L. brevis and L. buchneri was studied. It was found that the cultures of L. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of L. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of L. casei and all cultures of L. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by Lactobacilli of different species.
TI  - [The fecal flora of man. III. Communication: The composition of Lactobacillus flora of different age groups (author's transl)].
AB  - From fecal flora of 66 infants aged 3 to 220 days, 29 children aged 4 to 6 years, 42 adults aged 20 to 64 years and 21 senile persons aged 65 to 86 years, the Lactobacillus flora was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. In the feces of babies only the resident lactobacilli (L. acidophilus, L. salivarius and L. fermenti) were found, while in the feces of children, adults and senile persons the resident lactobacilli as well as the transient lactobacilli (L. casei, L. plantarum, L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. lactis) were found simultaneously. Within the Lactobacillus species L. acidophilus type I, L. fermenti type IVa and L. salivarius type Ia were most frequently found in the feces of all age groups. In addition, L. acidophilus type X was also often found in the feces of senile persons. In connection with the numbers of species or types of lactobacilli in one fecal specimen, one or two species or types were demonstrated in 94,5% of positive cases of infants. With increasing age the numbers increased, especially more than three species or types were demonstrated in 85% of positive cases. In infants in 3 different clinics, clinic-specificities were demonstrated in relation to the species or types of lactobacilli isolated: in each clinic clearly certain species or types of lactobacilli were present. The results indicate that the composition of the Lactobacillus flora in the feces is influenced by lactobacilli orally ingested.
TI  - Mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic Streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  - Mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near pH 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. Mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 C in the pH range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 C in the acid range. N-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mM, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. Mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against S. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. The lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. Digestion of the cell walls of S. mutans BHT by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. Mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.
