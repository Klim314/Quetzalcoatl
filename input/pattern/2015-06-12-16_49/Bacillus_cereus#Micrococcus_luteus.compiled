TI  - Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides as potent Gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  - Twelve 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides have been tested as potential antibacterials. All the compounds had MICs between 0.49 and 15.63 microg/ml toward Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis indicating, in most cases, equipotent or even more effective action than cefuroxime. In order to clarify if the observed antibacterial effects are universal, further research were undertaken to test inhibitory potency of two most potent compounds 3 and 11 on clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. Compound 11 inhibited the growth of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) at MICs of 1.95-7.81 microg/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at MICs of 0.49-1.95 microg/ml and MDR-MRSA at MIC of 0.98 and 3.90 microg/ml, respectively. Finally, inhibitory efficacy of 3 and 11 on planktonic cells and biofilms formation in clinical isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested. The majority of cells in biofilm populations of MSSA and MRSA were eradicated at low level of 3, with MBICs in the range of 7.82-15.63 microg/ml.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and genotypic-phenotypic characteristics of bacteriocin-producing Bacillus subtilis KKU213: potential as a probiotic strain.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and probiotic properties of Bacillus subtilis strain KKU213, isolated from local soil, were investigated. The cell-free supernatant (CFS) of a KKU213 culture containing crude bacteriocins exhibited inhibitory effects on Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial activity of the CFS precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate (AS) remained even after treatment at 60 and 100 degrees C, at pH 4 and 10 and with proteolytic enzymes, detergents and heavy metals. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE and overlaid with the indicator strains B. cereus and S. aureus, the 40% AS precipitate exhibited inhibitory activity on proteins smaller than 10 kDa. However, proteins larger than 25 kDa and smaller than 10 kDa were still observed on a native protein gel. Purified subtilosin A was prepared by Amberlite XAD-16 bead extraction and HPLC and analyzed by Nano-LC-QTOF-MS. Its molecular mass was found to be 3.4 kDa, and it retained its antibacterial activity. These results are consistent with the detection of the anti-listerial subtilosin A gene of the sbo/alb cluster in the KKU213 strain, which is 100% identical to that of B. subtilis subsp. subtilis 168. In addition to stable and cyclic subtilosin A, a mixture of many extracellular antibacterial peptides was also detected in the KKU213 culture. The KKU213 strain produced extracellular amylase, cellulase, lipase and protease, is highly acid-resistant (pH 2) when cultured in inulin and promotes health and reduces infection of intestinally colonized broiler chickens. Therefore, we propose that bacteriocin-producing B. subtilis KKU213 could be used as a potential probiotic strain or protective culture.
TI  - Bacillus Spp. isolated from the conjunctiva and their potential antimicrobial activity against other eye pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we attempted to screen and investigate antibacterial activity of Bacillus species, which were isolated from conjunctiva, against other eyes pathogens. METHODS: To examine predominant isolates of Bacillus subtilis, B. pumilus, B. cereus and B. mojevensis, isolated from conjunctiva for their antimicrobial activity against indicator microorganisms as Micrococcus luteus, Staphyloccocus aureus, S. epidermidis, S.hominis, S. lugdunensis, S.warneri, S. haemolyticus, B. cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. Growth inhibitions of indicator microorganisms were tested using agar diffusion tests by cells and supernatants of five B. mojevensis, one B. subtilis, four B. cereus and five B. pumilus strains which were isolated from conjunctiva. RESULTS: The Bacillus isolates showed variable ability of inhibition against the tested microorganisms. Two strains of B. pumillus, 1 strain of B. subtilis, 5 strains of B. mojevensis, 1 strain of B. cereus were efficacious against the tested microorganisms. Most resistant microorganism to these bacteria was Proteus mirabilis. Two of Gram positive bacteria, S. lugdenensis (K15-9) and S. aureus (SDA48), were also found as resistant. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, Bacillus spp isolated from conjunctiva showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Human eye-derived microorganisms and their antimicrobial effects might be a useful source of natural products for the future.
TI  - Antibacterial tetraoxygenated xanthones from the immature fruits of Garcinia cowa.
AB  - A phytochemical investigation of the acetone extract from the immature fruits of  Garcinia cowa led to the isolation of two novel tetraoxygenated xanthones, garcicowanones A (1) and B (2), together with eight known tetraoxygeanted xanthones. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus TISTR 688, Bacillus subtilis TISTR 008, Micrococcus luteus TISTR 884, Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 1466, Escherichia coli TISTR 780, Pseudomonas aeruginosa TISTR 781, Salmonella typhimurium TISTR 292 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. alpha-Mangostin showed potent activity (MIC 0.25-1 mug/mL) against three Gram-positive strains and garcicowanone A and beta-mangostin exhibited strong antibacterial activity against B. cereus with the same MIC values of 0.25 mug/mL.
TI  - Influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - The results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. To be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (DA) and molecular weights (MW) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. They were tested at different pH values for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi), four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (DA and MW) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. Considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower DA and the lower pH give the larger efficiency. Antibacterial activity was further enhanced for Gram-negative bacteria with decreasing MW, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the Gram-positive. Concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. Fungal growth decreased with increasing MW for F. oxysporum and decreasing DA for A. solani, but no MW or DA dependences were observed with A. niger.
TI  - Further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  - The antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide anion radical (.O2(-)), methoxy radical (.CH2OH), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.CO2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.NO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.DPPH) radical. It reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising activity against .CO2(-), .CH2OH and .DPPH radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .NO, .O2(-) and .OH radicals (38%, 23% and 15%, respectively). The antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. To varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (MIC 0.003-0.038 mg/mL and MBC 0.013-0.052 mg/mL, MIC 0.008-0.016 mg/mL and MFC 0.090-0.520 mg/mL, respectively). According to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.
TI  - Capillary electrophoresis of microbial aggregates.
AB  - Uncontrolled aggregation of bacterial cells is a significant disadvantage of electrophoretic separations. Various aspects of the electrophoretic behavior of different strains of Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus(1), and Micrococcus luteus bacteria and Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria were investigated in this study. Our findings indicate that bacteria can be rapidly analyzed by CZE with surface charge modification by calcium ions (Ca(2+)). Bound Ca(2+) ions increase zeta potential to more than 2.0 mV and significantly reduce repulsive forces. Under the above conditions, bacterial cells create compact aggregates, and fewer high-intensity signals are observed in electropherograms. The above can be attributed to the bridging effect of Ca(2+) between bacterial cells. CE was performed to analyze bacterial aggregates in an isotachophoretic mode. A single peak was observed in the electropherogram.
TI  - Antimicrobial constituents of the leaves of Mikania micrantha H. B. K.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To isolate plant-derived compounds with antimicrobial activity from the leaves of Mikania micrantha, to determine the compounds configuration, and to evaluate their antimicrobial activity against eight plant pathogenic fungi (Exserohilum turcicum, Colletotrichum lagenarium, Pseudoperonispora cubensis, Botrytis cirerea, Rhizoctonia solani, Phytophthora parasitica, Fusarium solani, and Pythium aphanidermatum,) and four plant pathogenic bacteria (gram negative bacteria: Ralstonia dolaanacearum, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae, Xanthomonas Campestris pv. Vesicatoria, and Xanthomonas campestris pv. Citri), and four bacteria (gram positive bacteria: Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Bacillus cereus). METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial constituents of the leaves of M. micrantha were isolated using bioactivity- guided fractionation. The antifungal activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated by the inhibit hypha growth method and inhibit spore germination method. Characterization of antibacterial activity was carried out using the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). MIC and MBC were determined by the broth microdilution method. Six compounds - deoxymikanolide, scandenolide, dihydroscandenolide, mikanolide, dihydromikanolide, and m - methoxy benzoic acid - have been isolated from leaves of Mikania micrantha H. B. K. Deoxymikanolide, scandenolide, and dihydroscandenolide were new compounds. The result of bioassay showed that all of isolated compounds were effective against tested strains and deoxymikanolide showed the strongest activity. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The leaves of M. micrantha may be a promising source in the search for new antimicrobial drugs due to its efficacy and the broadest range. Meanwhile, adverse impact of M. micrantha will be eliminated.
TI  - Skin-associated Bacillus, staphylococcal and micrococcal species from the house dust mite, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and bacteriolytic enzymes.
AB  - Dust mites produce bacteriolytic enzymes, one of which belongs to the NlpC/P60 superfamily comprising bacterial and fungal proteins. Whether this enzyme is derived from the mite or from mite-associated microbes is unclear. To this end, the bacteriology of mites per se, and carpet and mattress dust from a group of asthmatic children and their parents was investigated. Dust from parents' and children's mattresses yielded significantly more colony forming units compared with dust from their corresponding carpets. Zymography demonstrated some dusts contained bacteriolytic enzymes, and in nine of the twelve dust samples from three of five houses examined, a prominent bacteriolytic band was obtained that corresponded to the mite band, although in one home, other lytic bands were detected. Fifty bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilised, commercially obtained Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. 16S rRNA, tuf and rpoB gene sequencing of nine Gram-positive isolates identified them as Bacillus cereus, B. licheniformis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis and Micrococcus luteus, known human skin commensals. 16S rRNA sequence homologies of four of the nine isolates identified as B. licheniformis formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster. All species secreted lytic enzymes during culture although the lytic profiles obtained differed between the rods and the cocci, and none of the bands detected corresponded to those observed in dust or mites. In conclusion, mites harbour a variety of bacterial species often associated with human skin and house dusts contain bacteriolytic enzymes that may be mite-derived. The identification of a novel cluster of B. licheniformis isolates suggests an ecological adaptation to laboratory-reared D. pteronyssinus. It remains to be determined whether the previously described mite-associated 14 K lytic enzyme is derived from a microbial source.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis as a tool for screening soil metagenomic libraries for antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Finding new antimicrobial activities by functional metagenomics has been shown to depend on the heterologous host used to express the foreign DNA. Therefore, efforts are devoted to developing new tools for constructing metagenomic libraries in shuttle vectors replicatable in phylogenetically distinct hosts. Here we evaluated the use of the Escherichia coli-Bacillus subtilis shuttle vector pHT01 to construct a forest-soil metagenomic library. This library was screened in both hosts for antimicrobial activities against four opportunistic bacteria: Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus luteus. A new antibacterial activity against B. cereus was found upon screening in B. subtilis. The new antimicrobial agent, sensitive to proteinase K, was not active when the corresponding DNA fragment was expressed in E. coli. Our results validate the use of pHT01 as a shuttle vector and B. subtilis as a host to isolate new activities by functional metagenomics.
TI  - Co-production of surfactin and a novel bacteriocin by Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis H4 isolated from Bikalga, an African alkaline Hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment.
AB  - Bikalga is a Hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment widely consumed in Burkina Faso and neighboring countries. The fermentation is dominated by Bacillus subtilis group species. Ten B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (six isolates) and Bacillus licheniformis (four isolates) isolated from traditional Bikalga were examined for their antimicrobial activity against a panel of 36 indicator organisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. The Bacillus spp. isolates showed variable inhibitory abilities depending on the method used. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were inhibited in the agar spot assay while only Gram-positive pathogens were inhibited in the agar well diffusion assay. Cell free supernatants (CFS) of pure cultures of 3 B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (G2, H4 and F1) strains inhibited growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, while CFS of 2 B. licheniformis (E3 and F9) strains only inhibited M. luteus. The antimicrobial substance(s) produced by B. subtilis subsp. subtilis H4 was further characterized. The antimicrobial substance(s) produced by H4 was detected from mid-exponential growth phase. The activity was sensitive to protease and trypsin, but resistant to the proteolytic action of proteinase K and papain. Treatment with alpha-amylase and lipase II resulted in a complete loss of antimicrobial effect, indicating that a sugar moiety and lipid moiety are necessary for the activity. Treatment with mercapto-ethanol resulted in a significant loss, indicative of the presence of disulfide bridges. The antimicrobial activity of H4 was heat resistant and active at pH3-10. PCR detection of yiwB, sboA, spoX, albA and spaS, etnS genes and genes coding for surfactins and plipastatins (fengycins) indicated a potential for subtilosin, subtilin and lipopeptide production, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out and a single band of approximately 4kDa had antimicrobial activity. Ultra high performance liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TOFMS) analysis of the 4kDa band allowed identification of surfactin and a protein with a monoisotopic mass of 3346.59Da, which is dissimilar in size to subtilosin and subtilin. Surfactin is a cyclic lipoheptapeptide, which contains a beta-hydroxy fatty acid, but no di-sulfide bridges or sugar residues. The complete loss of activity upon amylase treatment indicates that surfactin was not responsible for the observed antimicrobial effect. However, it cannot completely be ruled out that surfactin acts synergistically with the detected protein, though further investigations are needed to confirm this.
TI  - [Synthesis and antimicrobial ivestigation of 8-quinolinols glucosaminides].
AB  - In the phase transfer system solid calcium carbonate--acetonitrile per acetylated O-beta-D-glucosaminides of 8-quinolinol, 2-methyl-8-quinolinol and 5-chloro-8-quinolinol were synthesized. Zemplen deacetylation was led to corresponding trioles. Obtained O-beta-D-glucosaminides were identified with 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Antimicrobial activity of deacetylated forms has been studied in a test of inhibition of bioluminescence of marine luminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri F1 and method of the serial breeding on the museum steams of Escherichia coli, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus. It was established that glycosylation decrease antimicrobial activity in comparison with non-glycosilated 8-quinolinols.
TI  - Technological properties and probiotic potential of Enterococcus faecium strains  isolated from cow milk.
AB  - AIM: To identify enterococci from the fermentation of milk for the production of  nono, an African fermented dairy product, to determine the technological properties for suitability as starter cultures and safety as probiotics. METHODS AND RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium CM4 and Enterococcus faecium 2CM1 were isolated from raw cow's milk. The strains were phenotypically and genotypically identified. Technological properties, safety investigations, in vitro adherence properties and antimicrobial characteristics were carried out. Strong acidification and tolerance to bile salts were recorded. The strains were bile salts hydrolytic positive and no haemolysis. There was no resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics. The strains exhibited adherence to human collagen type IV, human fibrinogen and fibronectin. The bacteriocins were active against Bacillus cereus DSM 2301, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes. Bacteriocins were stable at pH 4-9 and on treatment with lipase, catalase, alpha-amylase and pepsin, while their activity was lost on treatment with other proteases. The bacteriocins produced were heat stable at 100 degrees C for 10 min. The bacteriocin produced by the strains was identified as enterocin A. CONCLUSIONS: The E. faecium strains in this study exhibited probiotic activity, and the safety investigations indicate their suitability as good candidates for a starter culture fermentation process. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of bacteriocin-producing E. faecium strains as starter cultures in fermented foods is beneficial but, however, their safety investigations as probiotics must be greatly emphasized.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - The constituents of essential oil: antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. from East Anatolia.
AB  - The chemical composition, antimicrobial activity, total phenol content, total antioxidant activity, and total oxidant status of the essential oil from Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. were investigated. Steam distillation was used to obtain the essential oil, and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity was tested by an agar disc diffusion method against the tested microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis NRRL B-744, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12598, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 25933, Escherichia coli 0157H7, E. coli ATCC25922, Micrococcus luteus NRLL B-4375, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Proteus vulgaris RSKK 96026, and Yersinia enterecolitica RSKK 1501. The major compounds found in volatiles of M. congesta were piperitone oxide, linalool oxide, veratrole, pulegone, dihydro carvone, naphthalene, iso-menthone, para-menthone, and cyclohexanone. Compared to that of reference antibiotics, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil is considered as significant. Results showed that M. congesta has the potential for being used in food and medicine depending on its antioxidant and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Identification of a new Bacillus licheniformis strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance.
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistance has spurred a great number of studies for  development of new antimicrobials in the past decade. The purpose of this study was to screen environmental samples for Bacillus strains producing potent antimicrobial agents. A new strain, which showed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica ser. Pullorum, was isolated from soil and designated as B116. This new isolate was identified as Bacillus licheniformis by morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses. The production of bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) started at early exponential phase and achieved highest level at early stationary phase. The BLS was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and its molecular mass was determined as approximately 4 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Culture supernatant of the new isolate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella spp. The BLS was resistant to heat, acid and alkaline treatment. Activity of the BLS was totally lost after digestion by pronase and partially lost after digestion by papain and lipase. The new isolate and relevant BLS are potentially useful in food and feed applications.
TI  - Antibacterial anthraquinone derivatives from a sea anemone-derived fungus Nigrospora sp.
AB  - Chemical investigation of a marine-derived fungus Nigrospora sp., isolated from an unidentified sea anemone, yielded two new hydroanthraquinone analogues, 4a-epi-9alpha-methoxydihydrodeoxybostrycin (1) and 10-deoxybostrycin (2), together with seven known anthraquinone derivatives (3-9). The structures of the two new compounds were established through extensive NMR spectroscopy as well as a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu Kalpha radiation. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1-9 and 10 acetyl derivatives (6a, 7a, 8a-8g, 9a) were evaluated in vitro. Compound 6a, the acetylated derivative of 6, exhibited promising activity against Bacillus cereus with an MIC value of 48.8 nM, which was stronger than that of the positive control ciprofloxacin (MIC = 1250 nM). Analysis of the antibacterial screening data for the metabolites and their acetyl derivatives revealed the key structural features required for this activity.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial properties of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of non-polymeric phenolic (NP) and polymeric tannin (PT) constituents in the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of six brands of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total phenolic content (TPC) and ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) were assessed using the Folin-Ciocalteu and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays, respectively. Minimum inhibitory dose (MID) against Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative. Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed using the disc-diffusion method. Teas were extracted with hot water successively three times for one hour each time. The extracts were fractionated using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography to obtain the NP and PT constituents. RESULTS: Extraction yields ranged from 12 to 23%. Yields of NP fractions (70-81%) were much higher than those of PT fractions (1-11%), suggesting that the former are the major tea components. Ranking of antioxidant properties of extracts was green tea>black tea>herbal tea. For all six teas, antioxidant properties of PT fractions were significantly higher than extracts and NP fractions. Extracts and fractions of all six teas showed no activity against the three Gram-negative bacteria. Green teas inhibited all three Gram-positive bacteria with S. aureus being the least susceptible. Black and herbal teas inhibited the growth of M. luteus and B. cereus, but not S. aureus. The most potent were the PT fractions of Boh Cameron Highlands and Ho Yan Hor with MID of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/disc against M. luteus. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that NP constituents are major contributors to the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of teas of C. sinensis. Although PT constituents have stronger antioxidant and antibacterial properties, they constitute only a minor component of the teas.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity, and phytochemical screening of Voacanga globosa (Blanco) Merr. leaf extract (Apocynaceae).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, cytotoxic,  and phytochemical properties of ethanol extracts of leaves of Voacanga globosa (Blanco) Merr. (V. globosa). METHODS: The extracts were tested against bacteria and fungus through disc diffusion assay; against protozoa through growth curve determination, antiprotozoal and cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: The extract revealed antibacterial activities, inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Antifungal assay showed that it inhibited Candida albicans. The antiprotozoal assay against Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica showed that V. globosa can inhibit the parasites, wherein the action can be comparable to metronidazole. With the in situ cell death detection kit, Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica exposed to V. globosa leaf extract was observed to fluoresce simultaneously in red and yellow signals signifying apoptotic-like changes. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the chemical composition of plant extract containing alkaloids, saponins, 2-deoxysugars, and hydrolysable tannins. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, this study provides scientific evidence on the traditional use of V. globosa leaf extract in treating microbial diseases. Further, the leaf extract can possibly be used to produce alternative forms of antimicrobials.
TI  - A new sesquiterpene from endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp.
AB  - A fungal strain named YLF-14 was isolated from the leaf of Altingia yunnunensis.  Based on the sequence at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the strain was identified as an Aspergillus sp.. A new sesquiterpene 5beta,8abeta-dimethyl-3,4,4abeta,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1,2,5alpha-trime thanol (1) and a known compound 12-N-methylcyclo-(L-tryptophyl-L-phenylalanyl) (2) were isolated from the culture of this strain. Bioassay experiments showed that the two compounds had no obvious effect on the growth of tested bacteria and nematodes.
TI  - Characterization in the archaeological excavation site of heterotrophic bacteria  and fungi of deteriorated wall painting of Herculaneum in Italy.
AB  - Microbiological characterization of frescos in four different locations (Collegio degli Augustali, Casa del Colonnato Tuscanico, Casa dello Scheletro and Casa del Gran Portale) of excavation sites of Herculaneum was carried out. The use of infrared thermography allowed detecting sample points on frescos with greatest moisture not visible to the naked eye, resulting in structural damage. The microclimatic conditions provided perfect habitat for bacteria and fungi, particularly of spore forming and mould. In fact, heterotrophic bacteria were prevalent in all wall paintings monitored (ranging from 18 +/- 2 CFU 100 cm(-2) to 68 +/- 4 CFU 100 cm(-2)), whereas fungi were also detected but at lower levels (ranging from 9 +/- 2 CFU 100 cm(-2) to 45 +/- 3 CFU 100 cm(-2)). Cultural-based method allow us to identify by 16S and 26S rRNA partial sequence analysis heterotrophic microorganisms belonging to different genera of Bacillus and Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium together with the unusual genera as Microascus and Coprinus. By using this approach, Bacillus-related species (B. cereus/B. thuringiensis group, B. simplex/B. muralis group, B. megaterium and B. subtilis) were isolated in all sample points analysed with the exception of the Casa dello Scheletro in which Micrococcus luteus/Arthrobactersp. group and Streptomyces fragilis were found. DGGE analysis of PCR amplified V3 region of rDNA from DNA directly recovered from frescos samples, enabled identification of bacterial species not identified using culturable technology asthose closest related to Microbacterium group, often associated with Brevibacterium, Streptomyces and Stenotrophomonas. Combination of culture-dependent and independent methods provided better microbiology characterization of heterotrophic microbiota present on the surface of ancient frescos of this important archaeological site.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of aerobic culturable arsenic-resistant bacteria from surfacewater and groundwater of Rautahat District, Nepal.
AB  - Arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater is a serious Environmental Health Management issue of drinking water sources especially in Terai region of Nepal. Many studies have reported that due to natural abundance of arsenic in the environment, various bacteria have developed different resistance mechanisms for arsenic compound. In this study, the culturable arsenic-resistant bacteria indigenous to surfacewater as well as groundwater from Rautahat District of Nepal were randomly isolated by standard plate count method on the basis of viable growth on plate count agar amended with arsenate ranging from 0, 0.5, 10, 40, 80 to 160 milligram per liter (mg/l). With respect to the morphological and biochemical tests, nine morphologically distinct potent arsenate tolerant bacteria showed relatedness with Micrococcus varians, Micrococcus roseus, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas sp., Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus smithii 1 and Bacillus smithii 2. The isolates were capable of tolerating more than 1000 mg/l of arsenate and 749 mg/l of arsenite. Likewise, bioaccumulation capability was highest with M. roseus (85.61%) and the least with B. smithii (47.88%) indicating the potential of the organisms in arsenic resistance and most probably in bioremediation.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - Anti-proliferative activity of meroditerpenoids isolated from the brown alga Stypopodium flabelliforme against several cancer cell lines.
AB  - The sea constitutes one of the most promising sources of novel compounds with potential application in human therapeutics. In particular, algae have proved to be an interesting source of new bioactive compounds. In this work, six meroditerpenoids (epitaondiol, epitaondiol diacetate, epitaondiol monoacetate, stypotriol triacetate, 14-ketostypodiol diacetate and stypodiol) isolated from the brown alga Stypopodium flabelliforme were tested for their cell proliferation inhibitory activity in five cell lines. Cell lines tested included human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3), murine macrophages (RAW.267) and Chinese hamster fibroblasts (V79). Antimicrobial activity of the compounds was also evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus. Overall, the compounds showed good activity against all cell lines, with SH-SY5Y and RAW.267 being the most susceptible. Antimicrobial capacity was observed for epitaondiol monoacetate, stypotriol triacetate and stypodiol, with the first being the most active. The results suggest that these molecules deserve further studies in order to evaluate their potential as therapeutic agents.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  - Petals of red, yellow and white roses (Rosa damascene Mill.) of the family Rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus), five species of Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (Penicillium notatum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum). All of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. Micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. Red and yellow petal extracts showed much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. Bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. The fungus, Penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. White roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against Penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. Chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of hexahydroimidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium bromides with varying benzyl substituents.
AB  - Variously substituted benzyl bromides were employed to quaternize hexahydrobenzylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (A) and the resulting bromides (1-11) were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against 10 pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumonia, Candida albicans and Candida krusei. Antimicrobial activities were surprisingly high (MIC: 0.78-400 mug/mL) and the sensitivity of the salts tested has been found to depend strongly both on the benzyl substituents and the microorganisms used. However, the correlation observed between antimicrobial activity and calculated partition coefficient (ClogP) was poor. Acute toxicity assessment of these salts showed LD(50) of 757-2000 mg/kg, after oral administration in mice in 24h.
TI  - In vitro antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antimicrobial activity studies on three Agaricus species with fatty acid compositions and iron contents: a comparative study on the three most edible mushrooms.
AB  - The fatty acids of Agaricus essettei, Agaricus bitorquis and Agaricus bisporus were investigated by using GC and GC-MS. The dominant fatty acids were found to be linoleic (61.82-67.29%) and palmitic (12.67-14.71%) acids among the 13 fatty acids detected in the oils. Total unsaturation for the oils was calculated as 77.50%, 77.44%, and 79.72%, respectively. In vitro antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antimicrobial activities were also studied. The ethyl acetate extract of Agaricus bitorquis showed the highest activity in beta-carotene-linoleic acid, DPPH(.) and ABTS(.)(+) assays, while the hexane extract of Agaricus bisporus exhibited the best metal chelating activity. The ethyl acetate and hexane extract of Agaricus bitorquis and the hexane extract of Agaricus essettei showed meaningful butyrylcholinesterase activity being close to that of galantamine. The extracts were found to be effective on Gram (+) bacteria, especially against Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus flavus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. In conclusion, Agaricus bitorquis and Agaricus essettei demonstrated higher iron content, and better antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antimicrobial activities than those of Agaricus bisporus commonly consumed mushroom. Hence, Agaricus species, particularly Agaricus bitorquis might be useful as antioxidant agents and moderate anticholinesterase agents, and their extracts will probably be used for development of dietary foods, food products and additives.
TI  - Maklamicin, an antibacterial polyketide from an endophytic Micromonospora sp.
AB  - A new spirotetronate-class polyketide, maklamicin (1), was isolated from the culture extract of an endophytic actinomycete of the genus Micromonospora. The structure and relative configuration of 1 were elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data, and the absolute configuration was determined using the modified Mosher method. Maklamicin (1) showed strong to modest antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of raw and processed honey.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate extracts  of raw and processed honey was tested against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi). Both types of honey showed antibacterial activity against tested organisms with the zone of inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 6.94 to 37.94 mm, while E. coli, S. typhi, and P. aeruginosa showed that sensibility towards all the extracts with ZOI ranges between 13.09 to 37.94 mm. The methanol extract showed more potent activity than other organic extracts. Gram-negative bacteria were found to be more susceptible as compared to Gram-positive bacteria except E. faecalis. The broth microdilution assay gave minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value of 625 mug/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranges between 625 mug/mL 2500 mug/mL. The study showed that honey has antibacterial activity (bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect), similar to antibiotics, against test organisms and provides alternative therapy against certain bacteria.
TI  - Biological and docking studies of topoisomerase IV inhibition by thiosemicarbazides.
AB  - 4-Benzoyl-1-(4-methyl-imidazol-5-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (1) was synthesized, and its antibacterial and type IIA topoisomerase (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) activity evaluated. (1) was found to have high therapeutic potential against opportunistic Gram-positive bacteria, and inhibitory activity against topoisomerase IV (IC(50)=90 muM) but not against DNA gyrase. An increase in activity against topoisomerase IV (IC(50)=14 muM) was observed when the imidazole moiety of (1) was replaced with the indole group in 4-benzoyl-1-(indol-2-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (2). However, (2) showed only weak antibacterial activity. Although the results of the bacterial type IIA topoisomerases inhibition study did not parallel antibacterial activities, our observations strongly imply that a 4-benzoylthiosemicarbazide scaffold can be developed into an efficient Gram-positive antibacterial targeting topoisomerase IV. The difference in activity against type IIA topoisomerases between (1) and (2) was further investigated by docking studies, which suggested that these compounds target the ATP binding pocket.
TI  - Diversity of endophytic bacteria in ginseng and their potential for plant growth  promotion.
AB  - Endophytic bacteria have been found in virtually every plant studied, where they  colonize the internal tissues of their host plant and can form a range of different beneficial relationships. The diversity of bacterial endophytes associated with ginseng plants of varying age levels in Korea was investigated. Fifty-one colonies were isolated from the interior of ginseng stems. Although a mixed composition of endophyte communities was recovered from ginseng based on the results of 16S rDNA analysis, bacteria of the genus Bacillus and Staphylococcus dominated in 1-year-old and 4-year-old plants, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clusters: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, and gamma-Proteobacteria, with Firmicutes being predominant. To evaluate the plant growth promoting activities, 18 representative isolates were selected. Amplification of nifH gene confirmed the presence of diazotrophy in only two isolates. Half of the isolates solubilized mineral phosphate. Except four, all the other endophytic isolates produced significant amounts of indole acetic acid in nutrient broth. Iron sequestering siderophore production was detected in seven isolates. Isolates E-I-3 (Bacillus megaterium), E-I-4 (Micrococcus luteus), E-I-8 (B. cereus), and E-I-20 (Lysinibacillus fusiformis) were positive for most of the plant growth promoting traits, indicating their role in growth promotion of ginseng.
TI  - Efficient "one-pot" synthesis of novel 3-azabicyclic spiro-1',2',4'-triazolidin-3'-thiones catalyzed by potassium superoxide and their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - A new series of novel 3-azabicyclic spiro 1',2',4'-triazolidin-3'-thiones 15-21 catalyzed by potassium superoxide under microwave irradiation have been synthesized and studied for their in vitro microbiological evaluation on clinically isolated bacterial strains namely Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa and fungal strains namely Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Candida 6 and Candida 51. Results of the in vitro microbiological evaluation of the synthesized compounds are discussed.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Aureocins 4185, bacteriocins produced by Staphylococcus aureus 4185: potential application in food preservation.
AB  - In the present study, the bacteriocins produced by Staphylococcus aureus 4185, a  strain isolated from bovine mastitis, were purified and partially characterized. After purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, and five runs of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), antimicrobial activity was recovered with 40% and 80% isopropanol, suggesting that more than one antimicrobial peptide, named aureocins 4185, is produced by S. aureus 4185. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed three peptides eluted with 40% isopropanol: peptide A (2,305.3 +/-1.5 Da), peptide B (2,327.3 +/-1.5 Da), and peptide C (3,005.5 +/-1.5 Da), and two peptides eluted with 80% isopropanol: peptide D (6,413.5 +/-1.5 Da) and peptide E (12,834.5 +/-1.5 Da). Although five peptides have been detected, only four small peptide sequences were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF)/TOF mass spectrometry analyses: SLLEQFTGK (eluted with 40% isopropanol), ALLYDER, NNTSHNLPLGWFNVK, and NNLAQGTFNATK (eluted with 80% isopropanol). The sequences SLLEQFTGK and ALLYDER revealed identity with hypothetical peptides with unknown function. The sequences NNTSHNLPLGWFNVK and NNLAQGTFNATK showed similarity to a segment of a precursor of staphylococcal autolysins. The antimicrobial activity detected in the supernatant of strain 4185 proved to be resistant to heat treatment at 65 degrees C; however, treatment at 80 degrees C abolished completely its antimicrobial properties. The concentrated supernatant containing aureocins 4185 exhibited a strong bacteriolytic activity toward Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698. Additionally, aureocins 4185 exhibited antagonistic activity against important foodborne pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, thus showing a potential application in food preservation.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of novel schiff bases of 3-amino-2-methyl  quinazolin 4-(3H)-one.
AB  - In the present study, novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes. The 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one was synthesized from anthranilic acid via the 2-methyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of Infrared (IR), (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, Mass spectral, and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11298)) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC 9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645) activities, using the paper disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by the agar streak dilution method. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4g and 4c was found to exhibit the highest anti-bacterial activity and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4k exhibited the highest anti-fungal activity.
TI  - Blechnum orientale Linn - a fern with potential as antioxidant, anticancer and antibacterial agent.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blechnum orientale Linn. (Blechnaceae) is used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of various skin diseases, stomach pain, urinary bladder complaints and sterilization of women. The aim of the study was to evaluate antioxidant, anticancer and antibacterial activity of five solvent fractions obtained from the methanol extract of the leaves of Blechnum orientale Linn. METHODS: Five solvent fractions were obtained from the methanol extract of B. orientale through successive partitioning with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol and water. Total phenolic content was assessed using Folin-Ciocalteu's method. The antioxidant activity was determined by measuring the scavenging activity of DPPH radicals. Cytotoxic activity was tested against four cancer cell lines and a non-malignant cell using MTT assay. Antibacterial activity was assessed using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution assays. Standard phytochemical screening tests for saponins, tannins, terpenoids, flavonoids and alkaloids were also conducted. RESULTS: The ethyl acetate, butanol and water fractions possessed strong radical scavenging activity (IC50 8.6-13.0 microg/ml) and cytotoxic activity towards human colon cancer cell HT-29 (IC50 27.5-42.8 microg/ml). The three extracts were also effective against all Gram-positive bacteria tested: Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Stapylococcus epidermidis(minimum inhibitory concentration MIC 15.6-250 mug/ml; minimum bactericidal concentration MBC 15.6-250 microg/ml). Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids and tannins. Ethyl acetate and butanol fractions showed highest total phenolic content (675-804 mg gallic acid equivalent/g). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that this fern is a potential candidate to be used as an antioxidant agent, for colon cancer therapy and for treatment of MRSA infections and other MSSA/Gram-positive bacterial infectious diseases.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic and biological studies on the new symmetric Schiff base  derived from 2,6-diformyl-4-methylphenol with N-aminopyrimidine.
AB  - A phenol based novel Schiff base polydentate symmetric ligand was prepared. The complexes were prepared by reacting ligand and the metal chlorides of Cu (II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Fe(II) in methanol to get a series of mononuclear complexes. The complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, conductivity measurements, magnetic susceptibility data, IR, UV-Vis, NMR and API-ES mass spectral data. The mononuclear structure of the complexes was confirmed on the basis of elemental analyses, magnetic susceptibility and API-ES mass spectral data. The ligand and all the metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, S. aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9345), one Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli ATCC 4230), and three yeast (Candida albicans ATCC 14053, Candida krusei ATCC 6258 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019) strains. Therefore, newly synthesized the ligand and two complexes [(Cu(II) and Co(II)] showed good biological activity against all tested bacteria and yeast strains.
TI  - New antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of falcarindiol isolated in Crithmum maritimum L. leaf extract.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of a chloroformic extract obtained from Crithmum maritimum leaves led to the chemical isolation of falcarindiol, a polyacetylene widely distributed within the Apiaceae family. Structure of this compound was confirmed by NMR and activity was tracked using a screening microplate bioassay. Falcarindiol strongly inhibited the growth of Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus cereus, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 50 microg ml(-1). Moreover, this compound showed cytotoxicity against IEC-6 cells with an IC50 value of 20 microM after 48 h of exposition. These results suggest that Crithmum maritimum could be potentially used in food manufactures and cosmetology as preservative agents and biopesticides, or in medicine as new antibiotics, confirming the interest in studying halophytic species as sources of bioactive compounds.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oregano (Origanum vulgare Linn.) against gram positive  bacteria.
AB  - The present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of infusion, decoction and essential oil of oregano (Origanum vulgare) against 111 Gram-positive bacterial isolates belonging to 23 different species related to 3 genera. Infusion and essential oil exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, S. aureus, Micrococcus roseus, M. kristinae, M. nishinomiyaensis, M. lylae, M. luteus, M. sedentarius, M. varians, Bacillus megaterium, B. thuringiensis, B. alvei, B. circulans, B. brevis, B. coagulans, B. pumilus, B. laterosporus, B. polymyxa, B. macerans, B. subtilis, B. firmus, B. cereus and B. lichiniformis. The infusion exhibited maximum activity against B. laterosporus (17.5 mm mean zone of inhibition+/-1.5 Standard deviation) followed by B. polymyxa (17.0 mm+/-2.0 SD) and essential oil of oregano exhibited maximum activity against S. saprophyticus (16.8 mm+/-1.8 SD) followed by B. circulans (14.5 mm+/-0.5 SD). While all these tested isolates were found resistant to decoction of oregano.
TI  - Structure and applications of a rhamnolipid surfactant produced in soybean oil waste.
AB  - Soybean oil soapstock was utilized as an alternative carbon source for the production of rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI strain. The chemical composition and properties of the rhamnolipid mixture obtained were determined to define its potential applications. The chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid has revealed the presence of ten different homologues. The monorhamnolipid RhaC10C1) and the dirhamnolipid Rha2C10C10 were the main components of the mixture that showed predominance of 44% and 29%, respectively, after 144-h of cultivation. The biosurfactant was able to form stable emulsions with several hydrocarbons and showed excellent emulsification for soybean oil and chicken fat (100%). The rhamnolipid removed 67% of crude oil present in sand samples and presented antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Mucor miehei at 64 microg/mL and inhibition of Neurospora crassa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus at 256 microg/mL. The results demonstrated that the rhamnolipid produced in soybean oil soapstock can be useful in environmental and food industry applications.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Dodonaea viscosa using contact bioautography technique.
AB  - The crude ethanolic extract and n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous fractions of Dodonaea viscosa were analyzed for antibacterial potential against four Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Preliminary screening showed inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The thin layer chromatograms of the fractions were then subjected to contact bioautography, which showed inhibition zone at different R(f) values against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the presence of antibacterial components. The MIC of each fraction was determined through a 96-well micro-titer plate method. The non-viability of the organisms was ascertained by determining the MBC of the fractions.
TI  - Anthocyanins, antioxidative, and antimicrobial properties of American cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) and their press cakes.
AB  - Amounts of total phenolics, anthocyanins, and ascorbic acid in 4 American cranberry varieties harvested at 4 stages of maturity were measured. The larger amount of phenolic compounds was found in berries of "Black Veil" cultivar (504 mg/100 g) at II stage of maturity. Significantly larger amounts of anthocyanins were determined in the overripe berries of the cultivars "Ben Lear" and "Black Veil." The amount of ascorbic acid in berries increased during ripening from I to III stage, and slightly decreased in the overripe berries. The biggest quantities of ascorbic acid were found in the ripe berries of "Ben Lear" cultivar (15.8 mg/100 g). The distribution of anthocyanins pigments was determined by HPLC-UV/MS in mature berries. The composition of individual anthocyanins in berries was quite similar in all the studied cranberry cultivars. While skins of cranberries are rich in anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds, the extracts of the by-products of cranberries juice-berry cakes, were analyzed and obtained results were compared with the properties of extracts made from whole berries. The anthocyanins and total phenolics content, radical scavenging activity, antimicrobial activity of the whole berries, and their press cakes extracts were measured. All investigated extracts from berries and their press cakes showed good radical scavenging activity and revealed antimicrobial properties. It was found that Bacillus cereus (ATCC 10876) and Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 9341) were the most sensitive among 10 tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Molecular characterization of early colonizer bacteria from wastes in a steel plant.
AB  - AIMS: Forty-nine bacteria isolated from four newly-produced waste samples of a steel industry, which had a high content of CaO, MgO, Cr and P2O5, were characterized molecularly and phenotypically by susceptibility testing against heavy metals. METHODS AND RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolates belonged to nine genera, Pseudomonas, Micrococcus, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Dietzia, Kocuria, Diaphorobacter, Staphylococcus and Brevibacillus. Besides, some isolates could be affiliated to species: M. luteus, Ac. junii, Ac. schindleri, B. cereus, K. marina, D. nitroreducens and Staph. warneri. The bacteria that were characterized are taxonomically diverse, and Pseudomonas and Micrococcus predominated. Fingerprinting BOX-PCR revealed high genomic heterogeneity among the isolates. Among the heavy metal compounds Zn, Ni, Pb and Cu were least toxic to the bacterial isolates, whereas Ag inhibited all isolates at 0.001 mmol l(-1). CONCLUSIONS: Heterotrophic bacteria, affiliated with several phylogentic groups, were able to colonize different wastes of a steel industry. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study extends our knowledge of the early colonizers bacteria populating siderurgic environments. Some of these bacteria could have potential for recycling siderurgic waste for steel production.
TI  - Wound healing, anti-microbial and antioxidant potential of Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh.
AB  - Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh (Loranthaceae) of the order Santalales, is used ethnomedicinally for treating ulcers, asthma, impotence, paralysis, skin diseases, and wounds. In this context, validations of the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in wound healing activity was studied, besides anti-microbial activity and antioxidant activity were performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. The ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Dendrophthoe falcata ethanolic extract (DFEE) was investigated for the evaluation of its healing efficiency on excision and incision wound models in rats. The results showed that Dendrophthoe falcata extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expressions were also well correlative with the healing pattern observed. Three of the fractions A-C (petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol, respectively) obtained from the extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Serratia marcescens, and five fungi Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis: dimorphic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger: systemic fungi, and some infectious bacteria Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi. The results also indicated that DFEE possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase levels and increased the catalase activity.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from the seeds of Enterolobium contortisiliquum (leguminosae).
AB  - Seeds of Enterolobium contortisiliquum were subjected to steam distillation to obtain a light yellow essential oil in a yield of 3 ml/kg of seeds. The major components of the oil were identified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and were furfural, limonene, linalool, estragole, carvone, and apiole with carvone representing more than 50% of the total composition. Antimicrobial activities of the essential oil were determined against four species of gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus) and two gram negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescencs). The essential oil inhibited the growth of all tested bacteria but was most effective against the gram positive bacteria. Chemicals that are responsible for the antibacterial effect of the essential oil were determined using the bio-autography thin layer chromatography (TLC) technique. The active compounds responsible for the activity were found to be carvone and estragole.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of some Schiff bases of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones.
AB  - In the present study, a series of novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes via cyclized intermediate 6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures were confirmed by means of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectral and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC-155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC-4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC-11778, Escherichia coli ATCC-25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-11298) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC-9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC-46645) activities by paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one 10 was found to be the most potent anti-microbial activity with MICs of 18.9, 19.1, 18.8, 21.7, 18.2, 19.3, 16.7, 8.6 and 10.1 microg/ml against above mentioned respective strains. Compounds were found to exhibit more anti-fungal than anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of labdane diterpenoids from Stemodia foliosa.
AB  - As part of a continuing interest in exploring the chemistry of Brazilian medicinal plants, three new labdane diterpenoids, 6alpha-acetoxymanoyl oxide (1), 6alpha-malonyloxymanoyl oxide (2), and 6alpha-malonyloxy-n-butyl ester manoyl oxide (3), together with the known betulinic acid, lupeol, sitosterol, and stigmasterol, were isolated from the aerial parts of Stemodia foliosa. The structures of 1-3 were established on the basis of interpretation of spectroscopic data, including HRESIMS, and 1D and 2D NMR techniques. All compounds were tested against a bacteria panel consisting of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, B. anthracis, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and M. phlei. Compound 2 showed moderate activity against these strains, with MIC values in the range 7-20 microg/mL.
TI  - Antimicrobial protein from Streptomyces fulvissimus inhibitory to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Fermented culture of Streptomyces fulvissimus was found to secrete an antibacterial protein inhibitory to Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. The extracellular protein from the fermented culture on concentration revealed a high molecular weight peptide of 63kDa on SDS-PAGE gel and the region on gel displayed inhibitory activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Bioactivity of the extra cellular protein was non-sensitive to proteinase K, alpha chymotrypsin, protease, EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid), PMSF (phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride) and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) but partially susceptible to amylase and heat. Glycoprotein nature of the proteinaceous compound was confirmed by periodic acid schiffs (PAS) staining. The secretary protein of S. fulvissimus demonstrated a significant activity against MRSA strain. It could be an important source for developing new drugs to control multidrug resistant gram positive bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Miconia species (Melastomataceae).
AB  - This work evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the methanol and chloroform extracts of the leaves of Miconia cabucu, Miconia rubiginosa, and Miconia stenostachya using the disc-diffusion method. The results obtained showed that the methanol extracts of the leaves of M. rubiginosa and M. stenostachya and the chloroform extract of the leaves of M. cabucu presented antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by Manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  - Although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. Here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. After being treated with Manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of Pichia pastoris was slightly affected. Microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. Viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed E. coli and B. subtilis cells. Under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) were killed. In the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than L-dopa, N-acetyldopamine (NADA) or N-beta-alanyldopamine (NBAD) did, suggesting that DHI and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. The antifungal activity of DHI was detected using P. pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Beauveria bassiana. These results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (DCE)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.
TI  - Bacterial, fungal and yeast contamination in six brands of irreversible hydrocolloid impression materials.
AB  - This study assessed the level of contamination of six commercially available irreversible hydrocolloids (two containing chlorhexidine) and identified the contamination present in the materials. Petri dishes containing selective and enriched culture media were inoculated with alginate powder (0.06 g), in triplicate. After incubation (37 degrees C/7 days), the colony-forming units (CFU) were counted and Gram stained. Biochemical identification of the different morphotypes was also performed. The contamination levels for the materials were: Jeltrate--389 CFU/g; Jeltrate Plus--516 CFU/g; Jeltrate Chromatic--135 CFU/g; Hydrogum--1,455 CFU/g; Kromopan--840 CFU/g; and Greengel--59 CFU/g. Gram staining revealed the presence of Gram-positive bacillus and Gram-positive cocci. The bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus sp., Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, and Nocardia sp.; the filamentous fungi Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Rhizopus sp., Neurospora sp.; and the yeast Candida sp. were isolated. The contamination detected in the impression materials points out the need for adopting measures to improve the microbiological quality of these materials. The use of contaminated materials in the oral cavity goes against the basic principles for controlling cross-contamination and may represent a risk for debilitated or immunocompromised patients.
TI  - New triazole and triazolothiadiazine derivatives as possible antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Triazole and triazoles fused with six-membered ring systems are found to possess  diverse applications in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry. The new 1,2,4-triazole and 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazine derivatives were synthesized as novel antimicrobial agents. The reaction of 1H-indol-3-acetic acid with thiocarbohydrazide gave the 4-amino-3-mercapto-5-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole. The reaction of triazole with arylaldehydes in ethanol gave the 4-arylideneamino-3-mercapto-5-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazoles (I). The 3-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-6-aryl-7H-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazines (II) were obtained by condensing triazole with phenacyl bromides in absolute ethanol . The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida glabrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi University, Faculty of Medicine) were investigated and significant activity was obtained.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus pumilus during the fermentation of African locust bean (Parkia biglobosa) for Soumbala production.
AB  - AIMS: To examine predominant isolates of Bacillus subtilis and B. pumilus isolated from Soumbala for their antimicrobial activity against indicator microorganisms as Micrococcus luteus, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococus facium, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aspergillus ochraceus and Penicillium roqueforti. METHODS AND RESULTS: Growth inhibition of indicator microorganisms by cells and supernatants of three B. subtilis and two B. pumilus strains was investigated using agar diffusion tests. Inactivation of indicator microorganisms was investigated in laboratory broth and during the fermentation of African locust bean for Soumbala production. The Bacillus isolates showed variable ability of inhibition and inactivation according to the indicator microorganism. The supernatants of pure cultures of B. subtilis inhibited one strain of B. cereus, one of Staph. aureus and E. coli and caused abnormal germination of Aspergillus ochraceus. The supernatant of mixed cultures of B. subtilis and indicators inhibited all the indicators. A treatment with protease eliminated the inhibitions. Isolates of B. subtilis inactivated all the indicators organisms during the fermentation of African locust bean as well as in laboratory broth with about five to eight decimal reduction. CONCLUSION: Bacillus isolates from Soumbala inhibit and inactivate Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as ochratoxin A producing fungi during both laboratory cultivation and natural fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Selection of starter cultures of Bacillus spp. for controlled production of Soumbala.
TI  - Culturable bacteria present in the fluid of the hooded-pitcher plant Sarracenia minor based on 16S rDNA gene sequence data.
AB  - The culturable microbial community within the pitcher fluid of 93 Sarracenia minor carnivorous plants was examined over a 2-year study. Many aspects of the plant/bacterial/insect interaction within the pitcher fluid are minimally understood because the bacterial taxa present in these pitchers have not been identified. Thirteen isolates were characterized by 16S rDNA sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. The Proteobacteria were the most abundant taxa and included representatives from Serratia, Achromobacter, and Pantoea. The Actinobacteria Micrococcus was also abundant while Bacillus, Lactococcus, Chryseobacterium, and Rhodococcus were infrequently encountered. Several isolates conformed to species identifiers (>98% rDNA gene sequence similarity) including Serratia marcescens (isolates found in 27.5% of pitchers), Achromobacter xylosoxidans (37.6%), Micrococcus luteus (40.9%), Bacillus cereus (isolates found in 10.2%), Bacillus thuringiensis (5.4%), Lactococcus lactis (17.2%), and Rhodococcus equi (2.2%). Species-area curves suggest that sampling efforts were sufficient to recover a representative culturable bacterial community. The bacteria present represent a diverse community probably as a result of introduction by insect vectors, but the ecological significance remains under explored.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and pollen composition of honey samples collected from different provinces in Turkey.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples from different sources were collected and investigated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 27736, Morganella morganii, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4375, Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, and Candida albicans. Pathogens exhibited different sensitivities towards the honey samples. The results showed that majority of the honey samples (75%) generally inhibitied the bacteria tested. The honey samples which were obtained from Izmir (samples 1 and 2) proved more effective as inhibitors against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus. The honey which was obtained from Mugla (sample 5) exhibited high anticandidal activity on C. albicans. A comparison of the honey samples on the basis of pollen content revealed that they were heterofloral, and samples which had highest antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus were dominated by pollen from Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae (sample 1), and Trifolium, Trigonella, Cyperaceae, Zea mays and Anthemis taxa (sample 2). The honey proved more effective on bacteria than antibiotics.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Varthemia iphionoides Boiss. extracts.
AB  - The hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, ethanol and water extracts of aerial parts of Varthemia, Varthemia iphionoides, were investigated for cytotoxic activity against human myelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells; DPPH radical-scavenging activity; antioxidative activity in the linoleic acid system; reducing power; antibacterial activity; the contents of phenolic compounds. A pronounced cytotoxic effect on human leukemia (HL-60) cells was shown in the hexane, chloroform and ethanol extracts, with inhibition of 89.0, 68.4 and 62.3%, respectively, at a concentration of 200 microg extract/ml. High DPPH radical-scavenging activity, antioxidative activity in the linoleic acid system and reducing power were found in the water and ethanol extracts, and were correlated to the contents of phenolic compounds. Antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides was shown in the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts. A compound responsible for the antibacterial activity was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract, and identified as 3-oxocostusic acid.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - Combined Plate Microbial Assay (CPMA): a 6-plate-method for simultaneous first and second level screening of antibacterial residues in meat.
AB  - This paper proposes an improved high throughput microbial method for the simultaneous performance of first and second level screening for antibacterial residues in meat. It is based on growth inhibition of B. subtilis on agar medium pH 6, 7.2 and 8, of B. cereus on agar medium pH 5.9, of M. luteus on agar medium pH 8 and of E. coli on agar medium pH 7.2 (research or first level screening) and on the use of confirmatory solutions (Pase, Paba, MgSO4) for the identification or second level screening. In kidney control samples, dialysis membranes were interposed between samples and the agar surface to both prevent the action of lysozyme and reduce false positive results. The proposed method detects beta-lactams, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides and quinolones at MRL concentrations and reliably indicates the inhibitor family. Results are obtained in 18-24 h.
TI  - Investigations on bacteria as a potential biological control agent of summer chafer, Amphimallon solstitiale L. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae).
AB  - Studying the bacteria of hazardous insects allows the opportunity to find potentially better biological control agents. Therefore, in this study, bacteria from summer chafer (Amphimallon solstitiale L., Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) we isolated and identified the insecticidal effects of bacteria isolated from A. solstitiale and Melolontha melolontha L. (common cockchafer, Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) and the mixtures of these bacterial isolates were investigated on A. solstitiale larvae. Crystals from Bacillus sp. isolated from M. melolontha were also purified, and tested against the second and third-stage larvae of A. solstitiale. The bacterial isolates of A. solstitiale were identified as Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus, based on their morphology, spore formation, nutritional features, and physiological and biochemical characteristics. The insecticidal effects of the bacterial isolates determined on the larvae of A. solstitiale were 90% with B. cereus isolated from A. solstitiale, and 75% with B. cereus, B. sphaericus and B. thuringiensis isolated from M. melolontha within ten days. The highest insecticidal effects of the mixed infections on the larvae of A. solstitiale were 100% both with B. cereus+B. sphaericus and with B. cereus+B. thuringiensis. In the crystal protein bioassays, the highest insecticidal effect was 65% with crystals of B. thuringiensis and B. sphaericus isolated from M. melolontha within seven days. Finally, our results showed that the mixed infections could be utilized as microbial control agents, as they have a 100% insecticidal effect on the larvae of A. solstitiale.
TI  - Purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.
AB  - Bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO) was purified with amberlite CG 50 H+ resin, CM sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. The activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a choromogenic substrate at pH 6.0. Purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with SDS-PAGE and Rz value (A412/A280). Rz value for the purified LPO was 0.8. Km value at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C for the LPO was 0.20 mM. Vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C. Bovine LPO showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Bacillus subtilis var. niger ATCC 10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Bacillus brevis FMC3, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 5, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Bacillus cereus EU, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Yersinia enterocolytica, Listeria monocytogenes scoot A, Bacillus megaterium EU, Bacillus megaterium DSM32, Klebsiella oxytocica, Staphylococcus aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. The LPO--100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of an eudesmane sesquiterpene isolated from common Varthemia, Varthemia iphionoides.
AB  - The ethyl acetate extract of the whole aerial parts of Varthemia iphionoides (Compositae) showed a pronounced antibacterial activity. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethyl acetate extract and further purification of the most antibacterially active fraction led to the isolation and identification of an antibacterial sesquiterpene, selina-4,11(13)-dien-3-on-12-oic acid. This compound exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against six bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of this compound which was determined by the agar dilution method ranged between 250 and 500 microg/ml.
TI  - Synthesis of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine were synthesised and characterised by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, Mass spectral and elemental analysis. The compounds were screened for antibacterial (Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 9144), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4678), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922)) and antifungal (Candida albicans (ATCC 2091) and Aspergillus niger (ATCC 9029)) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. 4-(4-(4-Hydroxy-benzylidene-imino)phenyl)-morpholine (7) was found to be the most potent antimicrobial activity with MIC of 25, 19, 21, 16, 29, 20 and 40 microg/ml against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus, M. luteus, E. coli, C. albicans and A. niger, respectively. All the other compounds exhibited moderate activity against the bacterial and fungal organisms tested.
TI  - Synthesis and study of antibacterial and antifungal activities of novel 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl] acetylamino]thiazoles.
AB  - Several 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl]acetylamino]thiazoles derivatives were synthesized by reacting 4-substituted-2-(chloroacetylamino)thiazoles with benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-thioles in acetone and in the presence of K2CO3. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, 1H-NMR, and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida globrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac.of Medicine) were investigated and in this investigation, a significant level of activity was illustrated.
TI  - [Microbiological method for the detection of antibiotic residues in meat using mixed-mode, reverse-phase and cation-exchange cartridge].
AB  - A microbiological method for screening of residual benzylpenicillin (PCG), oxytetracycline (OTC) and spiramycin (SPM) in meat using a single mixed mode, reversed-phase and cation-exchange cartridge was developed. A meat sample was extracted with 0.1 mol/mL pH 4.5 phosphate buffer and the extract was applied to a MCX cartridge. The cartridge was washed, and adsorbed antibiotic residues were eluted with acetonitrile for acidic fractions and acetonitrile containing 5% ammonia solution-0.1 mol/mL pH 4.5 phosphate buffer (9:1, v/v) for basic fractions. Each eluate was evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in phosphate buffer to prepare test solutions for microbiological assay. When the diameter of the inhibition zone was more than 12 mm, the result was considered positive. In this method, the average recoveries of PCG at 0.05 microg/g, OTC at 0.1 microg/g and SPM at 0.2 microg/g were 70%, 92% and 84%, respectively. Tolerances of the three antibiotics were detected. All the results demonstrate that this method is simple, rapid and useful for screening of these three antibiotic residues in meat.
TI  - [Interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. Neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland. The checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. In one case Salmonella Enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. Additive effects were predominant--49%. In 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. In combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. The best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of some medicinal plants used in Iran.
AB  - Forty-five species of 29 plant families used in the traditional medicine by Iranian people, showed antibacterial activities against one or more of the bacterial species: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. No plant showed activity against Serratia marcescens; Bordetella bronchiseptica being the most susceptible species. All extracts showed the same activity 18 months later.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of grapefruit seed extract against Paenibacillus larvae  subsp. larvae.
AB  - Twenty-one samples of grapefruit seed extract (GSE) either from marketed products or provided by an apiculturist were analysed to verify their inhibition activity, in particular against Paenibacillus larvae subsp. larvae, responsible for American foulbrood. The bactericide capacity of GSE has been measured in Bacillus subtilis BGA, Bacillus cereus 11778, Bacillus cereus K250 and Micrococcus luteus 9341a; these bacteria are normally used in the laboratory to study inhibitors. The results showed that not all GSE have the same inhibitory activity and two of those analysed do not inhibit the five bacteria used. Considering that 19 samples inhibited American foulbrood bacillus, the authors conclude that the use of a natural product (such as GSE) to control this important disease of bees, can be used as a substitute for chemotherapeutic products, after appropriate expedients.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of plants used in Iranian folkloric medicine.
AB  - Fifty methanolic plant extracts belonging to 44 plant species of 33 families finding use in Iranian folkloric medicine were screened for antibacterial activity. Thirty samples, including 28 species in 20 families, had antibacterial activity against at least on one of the bacteria. Among the active plants, 32.6% were active against G(-), 62% against G(+), and 47.3% against both G(-) and G(+) bacteria. Dianthus coryophyllus was active against all tested G(-) and G(+) bacteria except Micrococcus luteus. Most susceptible G(-) bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bordetella bronchiseptica and least susceptible G(-) bacterium was Escherichia coli. In G(+) bacteria, most and least susceptible were Staphylococcus aureus and M. luteus, respectively. The least MIC, as 0.62 mg/ml, belonged to Myrtus communis seeds against S. aureus, Bacillus cereus and B. bronchiseptica, and to Terminalia chebula ripe seeds against S. aureus.
TI  - Characterization of a broad range antimicrobial substance from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this research was to isolate and characterize an antimicrobial substance from the Bacillus cereus type strain ATCC 14579. METHODS AND RESULTS: A substance with antimicrobial activity was isolated from B. cereus ATCC 14579. The substance was produced during late exponential growth and well into the stationary phase with a maximum 9 h after inoculation. The inhibitory substance was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and shown to be highly active against closely related Bacillus spp. Clinically relevant species such as Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. The substance was characterized as a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) with a molecular mass of ca 3.4 kDa. The BLIS was very heat stable, and sensitive only to pronase E and proteinase K. Antimicrobial activity was stable and high in the pH range of 2.0-9.0, and relatively unaffected by organic chemicals. CONCLUSIONS: An antimicrobial substance produced by the B. cereus type strain ATCC 14579 was characterized, with a wide spectrum of activity and the potential to be applied as a control agent against pathogenic bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study is the first report of a substance with antimicrobial activity from the B. cereus type strain.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of tick defensin against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Defensins are a major group of antimicrobial peptides and are found widely in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. Invertebrate defensins have been identified from insects, scorpions, mussels and ticks. In this study, chemically synthesized tick defensin was used to further investigate the activity spectrum and mode of action of natural tick defensin. Synthetic tick defensin showed antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive bacteria but not Gram-negative bacteria and low hemolytic activity, characteristic of invertebrate defensins. Furthermore, bactericidal activity against pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was observed. However, more than 30 min was necessary for tick defensin to completely kill bacteria. The interaction of tick defensin with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and its ability to disrupt the membrane potential was analyzed. Tick defensin was able to disrupt the membrane potential over a period of 30-60 min consistent with its relatively slow killing. Transmission electron microscopy of Micrococcus luteus treated with tick defensin showed lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane and leakage of cellular cytoplasmic contents. These findings suggest that the primary mechanism of action of tick defensin is bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis. In addition, incomplete cell division with multiple cross-wall formation was occasionally seen in tick defensin-treated bacteria showing pleiotropic secondary effects of tick defensin.
TI  - Synthesis of 6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a series of 1-ethyl/benzyl-6-fluoro-7-(substituted piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, mass spectral and elemental analysis. The in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the compounds were evaluated by paper disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. The in vivo antibacterial activity of the compounds against Escherichia coli was also evaluated by mouse protection test. All the compounds exhibited significant antibacterial and weak antifungal activities. The in vivo antibacterial activity (ED50) against E. coli was 50-160 mg kg(-1) in the order of 7<9<8<10. 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-(2,5-dioxo-piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carbox ylic acid (7) was found to exhibit the most potent in vitro antimicrobial activity with MIC of 4.1, 3.1, 3.1, 2.4, 1, 1, 25 and >100 microg mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger.
TI  - Development of a rapid 1-h fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay for Listeria species.
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is cytotoxic to the lymphocyte-origin hybridoma Ped-2E9 cell line. The relative cytotoxicity can be calculated by assaying the release of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) from the infected cell line. In this study, a fluorogenic substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, MUP) was used to quantify the ALP activity. The assay is 3.5-fold more sensitive than the colorimetric-based assay and requires only 1 h to differentiate virulent from avirulent strains. In addition to various Listeria species, 27 different common foodborne or clinical microorganisms were tested with the fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay and only six cultures (Bacillus cereus, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas putida, Corynebacterium glutamicum and Micrococcus luteus) showed cytotoxic effects similar to L. monocytogenes. To use this assay as a confirmatory test for virulent L. monocytogenes suspect strains, pure cultures must be isolated from the sample prior to testing.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated Bacillus sp. Strain 8 A.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by Bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: A bacteriocin produced by the bacterium Bacillus cereus 8 A was identified. The antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. A crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and several species of Bacillus. Clinically relevant bacteria such as Streptococcus bovis and Micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. Bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees C, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees C. It was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase K and pronase E. Bacteriocin activity was observed in the pH range of 6.0-9.0. CONCLUSIONS: A bacteriocin produced by Bacillus cereus 8 A was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.
TI  - Antimicrobial studies on three species of Hypericum from the Canary Islands.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of several extracts and fractions of the aerial parts  of Hypericum canariense, Hypericum glandulosum and Hypericum grandifolium was investigated using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods against twelve reference microorganisms (eight bacterial and four fungal strains). The methanol extract and chloroform fraction of H. canariense, as well as the methanol extracts, butanol and chloroform fractions of both H. glandulosum and H. grandifolium exhibited a good antibacterial activity against four Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus var. mycoides, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica with the diameters of growth inhibition area in the range 10-25 mm and MICs values between 0.03 and 0.29 mg/ml. Neither the infusions and aqueous fractions of the species studied nor the butanol fraction of H. canariense showed any antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms. Amongst the active extracts, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination showed that the H. canariense chloroform fraction was the most active against M. luteus, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. No antifungal activity was seen with any of the extracts or fractions tested. The results of this study support the use of these species in Canarian traditional medicine to treat skin infections.
TI  - Essential oil constituents and in vitro antimicrobial activity of Decalepis hamiltonii roots against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Hydrodistillation of Decalepis hamiltonii roots yielded an essential oil (0.33% v/w) that contained 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (37.45%), 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (31.01%), 4-O-methylresorcylaldehyde (9.12%), benzyl alcohol (3.16%), and alpha-atlantone (2.06%) as major constituents, with aromatic aldehydes constituting the main fraction of this root's essential oil. The oil was tested for its antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens responsible for food spoilage and human pathologies using standard antimicrobial assays. It exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus roseus, and Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration range of 1:0 with inhibitory activities of 27, 23, 16, 19, 22, 19, and 23 mm, respectively, which are comparable to those of the standards. The roots of D. hamiltonii, therefore, may be considered as an inexpensive source of an essential oil rich in antimicrobial compounds against foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Biochemical mineralization of native gold.
AB  
TI  - [Comparative study of the elemental composition of vegetative and dormant microbial cells].
AB  - X-ray microanalysis showed that vegetative cells, viable resting forms, and nonviable forms (micromummies) of the bacteria Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae differ in the contents of bioelements S, P, Ca, and K and the Ca/K and P/S ratios. Viable resting forms (cystlike refractory cells and bacillar endospores) had more calcium and less phosphorus and potassium than vegetative cells, the difference being higher for bacilli than for micrococci and yeasts. The distinctive feature of all viable resting microbial forms was their low P/S ratios and high Ca/K ratios. The differences revealed in the cellular content and ratios of bioelements probably reflect changes in ionic homeostasis accompanying the transition of vegetative microbial cells to the dormant state. Relevant potassium parameters indicate that the membranes of viable resting forms retain their barrier function. At the same time, the nonviable forms, even morphologically intact, of B. cereus and S. cerevisiae exhibited an anomalously low content of potassium, while those of M. luteus had an anomalously high content of this element. This suggests that the cellular membranes of micromummies lose their barrier function, which results in a free diffusion of potassium ions across the membranes. The possibility of using the elemental composition parameters for quick analysis of the physiological state of microorganisms in natural environments is discussed.
TI  - Gas sensor arrays for early detection of infection in mammalian cell culture.
AB  - The detection of bacterial infections in a mammalian cell culture process is realised using a gas sensor array. In production-scale and laboratory-scale cultivations of a perfused recombinant CHO-cell culture producing human blood coagulation Factor VIII, we show that the gas sensor array identifies bacterial contamination earlier than conventional methods. The sensitivity of the instrument is verified by inoculation of a blank cell culture medium with defined bacterial cell counts.
TI  - [Synthesis of anabiosis autoinducers in non-spore-forming bacteria as a mechanism regulating their activity in soil and subsoil sedimentary rocks].
AB  - Non-spore-forming bacteria of the genera Arthrobacter and Micrococcus, isolated from permafrost subsoil, were found to produce greater amounts of the d1 extracellular factor than closely related collection strains isolated from soil. The effect of this factor, responsible for cell transition to anabiosis, was not species-specific. Thus, the d1 crude preparation isolated from the culture liquid of the permafrost isolate Arthrobacter globiformis 245 produced an effect on the collection strain Arthrobacter globiformis B-1112 and also on Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus cereus. The crude d1 preparation from the permafrost isolate of Arthrobacter differed from the chemical analogue of this factor, 4n-hexylresorcinol, in the level of the induced cell response, which may have resulted from different cell sensitivity to various homologs of alkylhydroxybenzenes contained in the d1 preparation. Thus, additional evidence was obtained indicating that autoregulation of bacterial growth and development is implemented at the level of intercellular interactions in microbial communities. Abundant production of the d1 anabiosis-inducing factors by bacteria isolated from permafrost subsoil is probably a result of special antistress mechanisms responsible for the survival of these bacteria under extreme conditions of natural deep cooling.
TI  - Inhibition tests for detection and presumptive identification of tetracyclines, beta-lactam antibiotics and quinolones in poultry meat.
AB  - A combination of three plates, seeded with strains of Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus or Escherichia coli, can be used for detection of residues of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. The sensitivity of each plate is optimal for only one of these groups, resulting in detection limits (LOD) lower than the corresponding maximum residue limits (MRL) and in distinct inhibition patterns typical for each antibiotic family. Beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin G, ampicillin and amoxicillin give only inhibition zones on the plate with M. luteus. Tetracyclines are detected up to the MRL level with B. cereus, and fluoroquinolones with E. coli. The LODs of the antibiotics tested were as follows: penicillin G (PENG) 0.9 ng, ampicillin (AMPI) 0.6 ng and amoxicillin (AMOX) 1.0 ng on the plate with M. luteus; tetracycline (TET) 4 ng, oxytetracycline (OXY) 3 ng, doxycycline (DOX) 0.6 ng, and chlortetracycline (CHL) 0.3 ng on the plate with B. cereus; enrofloxacin (ENRX) 1.5 ng, ciprofloxacin (CIPX) 0.5 ng and flumequine (FLUM) 1.5 ng on the plate with E. coli. The combination of plates enables the laboratory to select appropriate chromatographic techniques for identification and quantification of the residues. On the other hand, the three groups can also be detected on one plate seeded with Bacillus subtilis, although the limits of detection are higher: PENG 0.4 ng, AMPI and AMOX 3 ng, TET 5 ng, OXY 8 ng, DOX 1 ng, CHL 0.5 ng, ENRX 4 ng, CIPX 10 ng and FLUM 4 ng. The test was applied to 228 broiler fillets and to 27 turkey thighs, originating from different poultry slaughterhouses. Nineteen broiler fillets contained inhibiting substances. The positive results of the inhibition tests were confirmed with a chromatographic technique. Doxycycline residues were found in 16 samples and amoxicillin in two.
TI  - Cytotoxic cardenolides and antibacterial terpenoids from Crossopetalum gaumeri.
AB  - From the methanol extract of the roots of (Crossopetalum gaumeri, four new highly cytotoxic cardenolides, securigenin-3beta-O-beta-6-deoxyguloside (2), 19-hydroxy-sarmentogenin-3beta-O-beta-6-deoxyguloside (4), sarmentogenin-3beta-O-[alpha-allosyl-(1-->4)-beta-6-deoxy alloside] (5), and securigenin-3beta-O-[alpha-allosyl-(1-->4)-beta-6-deoxyal loside] (6) were isolated. The dichloromethane extract afforded the new diterpene 3,15-dihydroxy-18-norabieta-3,8,11,13-tetraene (7) as well as the new triterpene 2,3,7-trihydroxy-6-oxo-1,3,5(10),7-tetraene-24-nor-friedelane-29-o ic acid methylester (11). The new terpenoids lack cytotoxicity and the antibacterial activity is moderate to low.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - New phloroglucinol derivatives from Hypericum papuanum.
AB  - Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the petroleum ether extract of the aerial parts of Hypericum papuanum led to the isolation of five new tricyclic phloroglucinol derivatives. On the basis of extensive 1D and 2D NMR experiments as well as MS studies, their structures were elucidated as the C-3 epimers of 8-hydroxy-4,4, 7-trimethyl-9-(2-methylpropionyl)-3-(1-methylvinyl)-5beta -H-tricyclo[ 5.3.1.0(1,5)]undec-8-ene-10,11-dione (1,2); the C-3 epimers of 8-hydroxy-4,4, 7-trimethyl-9-(2-methylbutyryl)-3-(1-methylvinyl)-5beta-H-++ +tricyclo[5. 3.1.0(1,5)]undec-8-ene-10,11-dione (3, 4), and 8-hydroxy-4,4, 7-trimethyl-9-(2-methylpropionyl)-5beta-H-tricyclo[5.3 .1.0(1, 5)]undec-8-ene-10,11-dione (5), and their corresponding tautomers (1a, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a). Compounds 1/1a-5/5a were named ialibinones A-E, respectively. Compounds 1/1a-4/4a showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  - Mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. Mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. The morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. Different bacterial strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. The results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by a surface film. The basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane. The membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. The results of this investigation seem to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. This type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.
TI  - Macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
AB  - A cDNA encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant African snail Achacina fulica Ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rAch) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kDa. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rAch was composed of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol N-acetylglucosamine residues. Antimicrobial activity using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed that the rAch had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. The rAch showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rAch inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis in addition to E. coli and S. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus. The rAch was also effective in preventing growth of Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results suggested that the rAch had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Identification and semiquantitative estimation of antibiotics added to complete feeds, premixes, and concentrates.
AB  - Classical microbiological methods for determining antimicrobial compounds in feeds are nonspecific. Thus, there is a need to identify biological activity, and bioautography is used for this purpose. A routine method for detecting the following antimicrobial substances in feeds is described: avilamycin, avoparcin, Zn-bacitracin, erythromycin, flavomycin, furazolidone, lasalocid, monensin, narasin, penicillin, salinomycin, spiramycin, tetracyclines, tylosin, and virginiamycin. Carbadox can be detected by UV light examination of the plates prior to bioautography. Semiquantitative estimations of antibiotic content are compared with quantitative determinations of the above mentioned substances in feeds, except erythromycin, penicillin, and tetracyclines. Detection limits range from 0.1 mg/kg (chlortetracycline) to 20 mg/kg (lasalocid). The method involves agar diffusion of buffered samples, a neutral extraction of polyether antibiotics followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and an acid extraction for other antibiotics followed by TLC. Five test bacteria were used for the main detection by agar diffusion: Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538P, Corynebacterium xerosis NCTC 9755, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633. Identification after TLC was achieved by bioautography with the most sensitive microorganism(s). This method allows one laboratory technician to analyze up to 30 feed samples within 2.5 working days, provided that feeds of the same category are analyzed in the same run, and that labels of additives are available. Qualitative and semiquantitative information are valuable when performing a quantitative antibiotic determination and it provides proof that the activity determined is due to the tested substance. This last feature is essential from the perspective of quality assurance of results.
TI  - Suitability of the Charm HVS and a microbiological multiplate system for detection of residues in raw milk at EU maximum residue levels.
AB  - In this paper we assessed the suitability of the Charm HVS and a newly developed  microbiological multiplate system as post-screening tests to confirm the presence of residues in raw milk at or near the maximum permissible residue level (MRL). The multiplate system is composed of Bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis plate at pH 8.0 for detection of beta-lactam antibiotics and tylosin, Bacillus cereus plate at pH 6.0 for detection of tetracyclines, Micrococcus luteus plate at pH 8.0 for detection of macrolides, Bacillus subtilis BGA plate at pH 8.0 for detection of aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-containing plate seeded with B. subtilis BGA at pH 7.0 for detection of sulphonamides, Escherichia coli plate at pH 6.0 for detection of quinolone and polymyxin, and Staphylococcus epidermidis plate at pH 6.0 for detection of novobiocin. For each test plate an action level is proposed in such a way that residues can be detected in raw bulk tank milk at levels near or below the established EU MRLs of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, macrolides, sulphonamides, colistin, and quinolones. The Charm HVS test used to confirm the presence of tetracycline and macrolide residues gave false-positive results near the EU MRLs. The multiplate system gave valid results. Based on data for raw bulk tank milk samples and the proposed action level for each test plate for suspected samples, we demonstrated that the multiplate system is a reliable post-screening method that can be performed easily and cheaply in microbiological laboratories.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of extracts from selected planktonic freshwater cyanobacteria--a comparative study of bacterial bioassays.
AB  - Aqueous and methanol extracts from five selected cyanobacteria were examined for  antibacterial properties in six different bacterial bioassays. All five cyanobacteria revealed antibacterial properties. Methanol extracts made from Tychonema bourrellyi, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii showed the most pronounced inhibitory effects, Aqueous extracts made from Microcystis aeruginosa and T. bourrellyi possessed evident antibacterial properties. The bacterial bioassays were based on agar diffusion tests and included pour-plate methods commonly used to detect residues of antibacterial substances in food. In addition, a pourplate bioassay with Aeromonas hydrophila was developed and described. Antibacterial effects were observed in five of the six bacterial bioassays. No antibacterial effect was observed in the Micrococcus luteus bioassay. Bioassays based on Aer. hydrophila, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis grown in Antibiotic Medium 8, pH5.85, seemed to be sensitive and suitable. The MIC value of diluted MeOH extracts made from C. raciborskii and T. bourrellyi against Aer. hydrophila corresponded to 38 mg freeze-dried cyanobacteria. Bacillus subtilis was more sensitive when grown in a culture medium with pH 5.85 than 7.9. The antibacterial properties of extracts from the cyanobacteria examined differed from defined cyanotoxins and antibacterial substances. The pattern of inhibition in the bacterial bioassays indicated that various antibacterial substances are involved.
TI  - Comparison of monolayer and bilayer plates used in antibiotic assay.
AB  - Standard curves of 5 antibiotics were determined in an antibiotic assay using bilayer and monolayer agar plates and AOAC-specified test organisms and agar media. Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341a and antibiotic medium No. 2 were used to prepare the penicillin G standard curve. The same organism and antibiotic medium No. 11 were used to prepare the erythromycin standard curve. Standard curves for streptomycin, tetracycline, and gentamicin were prepared, respectively, with antibiotic medium No. 5 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, antibiotic medium No. 8 and B. cereus ATCC 11778, and antibiotic medium No. 11 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. Assays of inhibition by meat fortified with penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin also were performed on monolayer and bilayer plates. Differences in standard curves and inhibitory responses obtained with monolayer and bilayer plates were < 10%. Thus, monolayer plates are acceptable for use in analyses of meat and poultry for antibiotics residues, with savings in laboratory resources and time.
TI  - [Formation of a resting form of Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus].
AB  - Under certain cultivation conditions, the bacteria Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus form cystlike refractive cells (up to 60% of the total number) that retain viability over a long time, are metabolically inactive and thermotolerant and possess specific ultrastructure. These properties allow them to be attributed to a new type of resting forms of microorganisms.
TI  - BE-24566B, a new antibiotic produced by Streptomyces violaceusniger.
AB  
TI  - Transformation of microorganisms with the plasmid vector with the replicon from pAC1 from Acetobacter pasteurianus.
AB  - A number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria species was screened for the expression of the gram-negative plasmid pACK5 and pACT72 with replicon of pAC1 plasmid from Acetobacter pasteurianus. As was described previously, both plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Acetobacter aceti, Shigella spp. and Citrobacter spp. Expressions of plasmids were successful in twelve species tested, Comamonas terrigena, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megatericum, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Micrococcus luteus, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptoccocus feacalis, and the stability of plasmid DNA was tested after cultivation in non-selective conditions.
TI  - A rapid method to quantify bacterial contamination on hatching eggs. 1. Correlation of optical density with initial bacterial count.
AB  - The use of optical-density (OD) readings after a 6-h incubation period, as a suitable method to quantify the bacterial contamination on hatching eggs, was established by the use of pure cultures of five bacterial isolates found to be the most prevalent on the hatching eggs examined. These isolates were identified as Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus gallinarum, Streptococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas cepacei and Bacillus cereus. It was established that the OD reading was repeatable when the same inoculum was used to inoculate five different cultures, which were incubated for 6 h at 37 degrees C. This repeatability was not affected by bacterial isolate, or bacterial concentration of the inoculum, or when mixed bacterial cultures were used. A direct relationship was established between the OD reading (at 540 nm) after 6 h and the log of the bacterial concentration at the start of incubation. The OD reading after 6 h of incubation is a repeatable, rapid and simple method to quantify the bacterial concentration at the start of the incubation period.
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - Periodic acid-Schiff-positive organisms in primary cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection. Case report and an investigation of the periodic acid-Schiff staining properties of bacteria.
AB  - Primary cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection frequently presents as a single necrotic bulla on the extremity of an immunocompromised patient. In lesional biopsy specimens and smears, the large gram-positive rods of B cereus may be mistaken for Clostridium species. This is a potentially serious error, as Bacillus species are resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. We studied a case in which large periodic acid-Schiff-staining organisms were seen in the biopsy specimen from a necrotic bulla on the finger of a neutropenic patient with diffuse large cell lymphoma. The tissue biopsy specimen subsequently yielded a pure culture of B cereus. Staining with periodic acid-Schiff was then performed on a series of bacterial species in human tissue and from smears of culture colonies. The following bacterial species were found to be consistently periodic acid-Schiff positive after diastase digestion: B cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Propionibacterium acnes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  - Pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees C to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
TI  - Detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Cell walls from various Gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. Bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. After renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. One to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls incorporated into gels. Crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various Gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (15 bands), Micrococcus luteus (1 band), Bacillus megaterium (4 bands), Bacillus sp. (6 bands), B. cereus (3 bands), B. subtilis (7 bands), Staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), Streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and Strep. pyogenes (5 bands). Molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kDa. Lytic activities against cell walls of Corynebacterium sepedonicum (Clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of Strep. pyogenes (45.7 kDa), Strep. faecalis (67 kDa), B. megaterium (67 kDa), and Staph. aureus (67 kDa).
TI  - [Antibacterial spectrum of lisosubtilin G10X].
AB  - Data on the antibacterial spectrum of lysosubtilin G10X, a preparation of lytic enzymes from Bacillus subtilis SK-52 are presented. Lysosubtilin was active against grampositive and gramnegative pathogenic bacteria. When it was used as a substrate of live lyophilized microbial cells the highest lysis levels were observed in B. brevis, B. cereus, B. pumilis, B. subtilis and S. faecalis. Preincubation of the substrate in acid media mainly increased the levels of the lysis by enzyme preparation. Sometimes the increase was very high (B. sphaericus, B. subtilis 720, E. coli K12 and MRE-600). Such a preincubation provided cell lysis in some strains not liable to the effect of lysosubtilin (B. cereus 1312, C. renale, M. luteus, S. aureus KP, 800, 805 and 126001, S. pyogenes 291). An increase in the lysosubtilin concentration in the reaction mixture in the majority of the cases did not provide favourable results. However, some strains resistant to the preparation at a concentration of 1000 units/ml were lysed with its 10 times higher doses. An increase in the lysis level was also achieved with increasing the time of the incubation with the enzyme preparation. Proceeding from the preparation antibacterial spectrum it is possible to recommend it for treatment of diseases in agricultural animals. Its use in veterinary was a success.
TI  - Effect of exposure of Pieris brassicae larvae to 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid on the natural antibacterial activity of serum.
AB  - Larvae of the cabbage white butterfly, Pieris brassicae, were reared on a semisynthetic diet with or without 20 ppm of the herbicide 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) and using three assays the sera were subsequently tested for natural antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli K12, and Micrococcus luteus. These assays showed that exposure of larvae to 2,4,5-T lowered the antibacterial activity of the serum against E. coli and M. luteus compared with control animals. Spectrophotometric tests for the presence of a lysozyme-like principle in the serum also revealed similar trends with a significant loss of enzyme activity in 2,4,5-T-treated insects. Overall total serum protein levels of control and 2,4,5-T-treated insects were similar, suggesting a specific effect of the herbicide on certain serum components such as lysozyme. The possible mode of action of the herbicide on production of antibacterial factors is discussed.
TI  - Extracellular product of Nocardia amarae induces bacterial cell flocculation.
AB  - The fact that Nocardia amarae YK1 produced a bacterial flocculation-inducing substance (designated as FIX) was discovered. FIX had a function of flocculating proliferous cells. FIX-induced flocculation was inhibited by making cells resting, but not completely by adding chloramphenicol. FIX worked widely on Gram-positive to -negative bacteria. In the presence of FIX, Achromobacter cycloclastus IAM1013, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus IAM1517, Bacillus subtilis IAM1069, Escherichia coli C600-1, E. coli IAM1239, Flavobacterium lutescens IAM1667, Klebsiella pneumoniae IAM1102, Micrococcus luteus IAM1313 and Pseudomonas putida IAM1002 formed flocs. B. cereus IAM1029, however, exhibited no flocculation.
TI  - Antibiotic identification by high voltage electrophoresis bioautography.
AB  - The high voltage electrophoresis bioautography method is applicable to meat, milk, and animal feeds. Meat is freeze-dried, powdered, and extracted with acetonitrile-water (9 + 1), and the extract is concentrated by evaporation at room temperature. Milk is examined directly or following acetonitrile-water extraction. Feed is extracted with acetonitrile-water. Samples or extracts are applied to preliminary assay plates of antibiotic medium No. 1 at pH 6 and 8, seeded with Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 9341), M. luteus DHSR (ATCC 9341A), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), or B. cereus K250 TR (NCIB 11183), and nutrient agar at pH 7 seeded with B. subtilis BGA. Inactivation of penicillinase indicates beta-lactam antibiotics. Addition of trimethoprim increases sensitivity to sulfonamides. After 18-24 h incubation at 30 degrees C, plates yielding clear inhibition zones guide selection of conditions for subsequent electrophoresis bioautography. Extracts are applied (5-100 microL) to 10 mm diameter wells on electrophoresis plates 60 cm long and 40 cm wide, with a gel depth of 1.6 mm. The support medium is 1% agar and 1% agarose in Tris/succinic acid buffers pH 6 and pH 8. A potential of 1500 V is applied for 1.5 h at 15 degrees C. Following electrophoresis, the migrated antibiotics are visualized by over-layering with antibiotic medium No. 1, pH 6 or 8, seeded with M. luteus or B. cereus spore suspension; plates are incubated for 18-24 h at 30 degrees C. Identification is based on results of preliminary screening together with electrophoretic migration distances and inhibition zone appearances compared with standards.
TI  - [Antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment].
AB  - This study was carried out to understand the antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment in boiling water. The samples included the core and the outer layers of onion, the white and the green parts of green onion, garlic bulb, ginger, ginger root, sweet pepper, chili pepper, brown pepper, and mustard. The test microorganisms included Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium phlei, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Micrococcus luteus. Raw garlic bulb could inhibit all of the test strains. The antibacterial activities of green onion are slightly weak than that of onion. However, green onion could inhibit P. aeruginosa and M. luteus, but onion could inhibit E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. faecalis, and B. cereus. Ginger and ginger root could only inhibit M. luteus. Chili pepper could inhibit V. parahaemolyticus and P. vulgaris. Brown pepper could also inhibit P. vulgaris. Sweet pepper and mustard showed no antibacterial activity to all of the test strains. In general, antibacterial components in the spice plants were heat labile. All the spices tested lost their antibacterial activities within 20 min at 100 degrees C.
TI  - Effects of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide on bacterial growth.
AB  - The effects of low concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on actively dividing cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus roseus, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus megaterium, and Bacillus cereus were studied. Fresh cultures of each organism were incubated for 24 h at 25 degrees C on both nutrient agar and mineral salts glucose agar plates under atmospheres containing various low concentrations of NO in air (0 to 1.9 ppm [0 to 2.0 micrograms/g of air]), NO2 in air (0 to 5.5 ppm [0 to 8.8 micrograms/g of air]), or NO and NO2 in air. Bacteria grown under air only were used as controls. After incubation, the colonies that developed on the plates were counted. None of the bacteria tested was affected by NO or NO2 at the indicated concentrations while growing on nutrient agar. Serratia marcescens, B. circulans, B. subtilis, B. megaterium, and B. cereus grown on mineral salts glucose agar were not significantly affected by NO or NO2. Low concentrations (0 to 1.9 ppm) of NO were bacteriostatic to log-phase cultures of M. roseus, M. luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus grown on mineral salts glucose agar. Bacteriostatic activity over a 24-h interval was maximal at an initial NO concentration of 1 ppm. Appreciable amounts of NO2 were produced in 24 h at initial NO concentrations greater than 1 ppm. These results suggest that NO2 may reduce the bacteriostatic activity of NO. Low concentrations (0 to 5.5 ppm) of NO2 in air did not affect any of the bacteria tested. At these low concentrations, NO affected bacterial growth, although NO2, NO2-, and NO3- did not. In addition, it was determined that the bacteriostatic activity observed in this study was not due to an increase in the acidity of the medium.
TI  - [Effects of photochemical smog from a flow reactor on bacteria. I. Determination  of the effects of photochemical smog on bacteria].
AB  - To measure the damage to bacteria from photochemical smog Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus and spores of Bacillus cereus have been exposed to defined gas-mixtures. A smog-simulation-chamber has been used which allowed adjustment of reproducible and longterm constant smog formations due to the flow system. Two methods have been applied to examine the bactericidal effects of the photo-chemical smog: adsorption of bacteria to membrane filters and spraying on silk threads. Smog mixtures formed by olefines (propene 4200 ppb, isobutene 3000 ppb, trans-2-butene 1600 ppb) and nitrogene oxides (500-700 ppb) showed bactericidal effects at ozone levels of 500 ppb. The survival of exposed bacteria is influenced less by gasing with 500 ppb ozone than with the smog mixture.
TI  - Biosynthesis of ribothymidine in the transfer RNA of Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis. A methylation of RNA involving 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate.
AB  - The methyl moiety of ribothymidine in the tRNA of Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and probably Bacillus cereus is dervied from a 1-carbon folate derivative and not S-adenosylmethionine. Micrococcus luteus (M. lysodeikticus) tRNA appears to be almost devoid of ribothymidine. S. faecalis tRNA lacking ribothymidine can be methylated in vitro with formation of ribothymidine. 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate has been identified as the 1-carbon donor involved in ribothymidine formation in S. faecalis and implicated in the analogous reaction in B. subtilis. The reaction requires FADH2 and/or another reducing agent present in cell extracts for the reduction of the methylene moiety.
TI  - [Antibiotic residues in organs and muscle tissues of broilers. I. Bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin and viriniamycin residues following administration of diets containing low levels of these antibiotics (author's transl)].
AB  - Two groups of broilers were fed two different feed mixtures. A feed containing a  mixture of bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin and virginiamycin (20 ppm each) was administered to sixity broilers. Sixty other broilers were given a similar feed not containing any antibiotics. After slaughter, samples of kidney, liver and breast were examined for the presence of antibiotic residues. All samples were found to be negative for antibiotic residues. Four micro-organisms were used in performing the tests: Bacillus cereus Kiel, Bacillus subtilis 165, Bacillus subtilis BGA and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the conjunctival sac of the horse].
AB  - The AA. report the results of taxonomic research conducted on the conjunctival sac of 59 horses for identification of the present bacterial flora. In the controlled animals, it was observed, at the level of the considered niche, a community constituted of normal bacterial populations, but not autochtonous in the significance they attributed from DUBOS et al., relative to the characterization of the indigenous microbiota of the intestine. The isolated normal bacterial flora seems to be constituted of: Micrococcus (subgroup 6 of Baird-Parker, M. luteus, Micrococcus spp.) isolated in 49,15% of the samples; Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis (18,64%); Moraxella osloensis, M. phenylpiruvica, M. equi and Moraxella spp. (11,86%); Bacillus cereus (11,86%); Neisseria catarrhalis (8,47%); Streptococcus equi and Str. zooepidemicus (6,77%); Corynebacterium spp. (6,77%) and Acinetobacter lwoffi (5,08%). The AA. have found, besides, a particular group of bacteria of uncertain classification, attributed to the coryneforms and found in 30,50% of the examined horses. So-called transient bacteria taxa have been considered are Streptomyces spp., isolated in the 10,16% of the controlled subjects, Aerococcus viridans and Bacillus spp. found in only one equine.
