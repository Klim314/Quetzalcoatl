TI  == bacterial etiologies of five core syndromes: laboratory-based syndromic surveillance conducted in guangxi, china.
AB  == background: under the existing national surveillance system in china for selected infectious diseases, bacterial cultures are performed for only a small percentage of reported cases. we set up a laboratory-based syndromic surveillance system to  elucidate bacterial etiologic spectrum and detect infection by rare etiologies (or serogroups) for five core syndromes in the given study area. methods: patients presenting with one of five core syndromes at nine sentinel hospitals in guagnxi, china were evaluated using laboratory-based syndrome surveillance to elucidate bacterial etiologies. we collected respiratory and stool specimens, as  well as csf, blood and other related samples for bacterial cultures and pulse field gel electrophoresis (pfge) assays. results: from february 2009 to december  2011, 2,964 patients were enrolled in the study. etiologies were identified in 320 (10.08%) patients. streptococcus pneumonia (37 strains, 24.18%), klebsiella pneumonia (34, 22.22%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (19, 12.42%) and haemophilus influenza (18, 11.76%) were the most frequent pathogens for fever and respiratory syndrome, while salmonella (77, 81.05%) was most often seen in diarrhea syndrome  cases. salmonella paratyphi a (38, 86.36%) occurred in fever and rash syndrome, with cryptococcus neoformans (20, 35.09%), streptococcus pneumonia (5, 8.77%), klebsiella pneumonia (5, 8.77%),streptococcus suis (3, 5.26%) and neisseria meningitides group b (2, 3.51%) being the most frequently detected in encephalitis-meningitis syndrome. to date no pathogen was isolated from the specimens from fever and hemorrhage patients. conclusions: in addition to common  bacterial pathogens, opportunistic pathogens and fungal infections require more attention. our study contributes to the strengthening of the existing national surveillance system and provides references for other regions that are similar to the study area.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  == zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (cas) and metalloproteases (mps) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of  nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. the development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. there is a wealth of data regarding bacterial cas and zinc mps present  in many pathogenic species, such as neisseria spp., helycobacter pylori escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, haemophilus influenzae, listeria spp, vibrio spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, streptomyces spp., clostridium spp., enterococcus spp., etc. some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. however, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial mps have been reported except for clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-ca families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and h. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from e. coli, h. pylori, m. tuberculosis, brucella spp., s. pneumoniae, s. enterica and h. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. the catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these cas are well understood as x-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have  been characterized so far. in vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. only  for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis and s. pneumoniae cas it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas and mps represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further  studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == identification of a novel streptococcal adhesin p (sadp) protein recognizing galactosyl-alpha1-4-galactose-containing glycoconjugates: convergent evolution of bacterial pathogens to binding of the same host receptor.
AB  == bacterial adhesion is often a prerequisite for infection, and host cell surface carbohydrates play a major role as adhesion receptors. streptococci are a leading cause of infectious diseases. however, only few carbohydrate-specific streptococcal adhesins are known. streptococcus suis is an important pig pathogen and a zoonotic agent causing meningitis in pigs and humans. in this study, we have identified an adhesin that mediates the binding of s. suis to galactosyl-alpha1-4-galactose (galalpha1-4gal)-containing host receptors. a functionally unknown s. suis cell wall protein (ssu0253), designated here as sadp (streptococcal adhesin p), was identified using a galalpha1-4gal-containing affinity matrix and lc-esi mass spectrometry. although the function of the protein was not previously known, it was recently identified as an immunogenic cell wall protein in a proteomic study. insertional inactivation of the sadp gene abolished s. suis galalpha1-4gal-dependent binding. the adhesin gene sadp was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. characterization of its binding specificity showed that sadp recognizes galalpha1-4gal-oligosaccharides and binds its natural glycolipid receptor, gbo(3) (cd77). the n terminus of sadp was shown  to contain a galalpha1-gal-binding site and not to have apparent sequence similarity to other bacterial adhesins, including the e. coli p fimbrial adhesins, or to e. coli verotoxin or pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin i also recognizing the same galalpha1-4gal disaccharide. the sadp and e. coli p adhesins represent a unique example of convergent evolution toward binding to the same host receptor structure.

TI  == evaluation of pyelonephritis in culled indoor and outdoor high parity sows.
AB  == the present trial was conducted in hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor  high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. all rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. in outdoor sows escherichia (e.) coli and actinobaculum (a.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. besides e. coli and a. suis, clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (staphylococcus (s.) albus,  s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. were  concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida, proteus spp. were concurrently found beside e. coli and a. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. in indoor sows e. coli and a. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida,  proteus spp. were found beside e. coli and a. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. however only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus  faecalis), staphylococci (s. albus, s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. implications: in eastern european climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.

TI  == mobilomefinder: web-based tools for in silico and experimental discovery of bacterial genomic islands.
AB  == mobilomefinder (http://mml.sjtu.edu.cn/mobilomefinder) is an interactive online tool that facilitates bacterial genomic island or 'mobile genome' (mobilome) discovery; it integrates the arrayome and trnacc software packages. arrayome utilizes a microarray-derived comparative genomic hybridization input data set to generate 'inferred contigs' produced by merging adjacent genes classified as 'present'. collectively these 'fragments' represent a hypothetical 'microarray-visualized genome (mvg)'. arrayome permits recognition of discordances between physical genome and mvg sizes, thereby enabling identification of strains rich in microarray-elusive novel genes. individual trnacc tools facilitate automated identification of genomic islands by comparative analysis of the contents and contexts of trna sites and other integration hotspots in closely related sequenced genomes. accessory tools facilitate design of hotspot-flanking primers for in silico and/or wet-science-based interrogation of cognate loci in unsequenced strains and analysis of islands for features suggestive of foreign origins; island-specific and genome-contextual features are tabulated and represented in schematic and graphical forms. to date we have used mobilomefinder to analyse several enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus suis genomes. mobilomefinder enables high-throughput island identification and characterization through increased exploitation of emerging sequence data and pcr-based profiling  of unsequenced test strains; subsequent targeted yeast recombination-based capture permits full-length sequencing and detailed functional studies of novel genomic islands.

TI  == [antimicrobial action of ammonium salts of fused heterocycles containing ortho-nitrogen].
AB  == by alkylation of hexamethylenetetramine with halogenated derivatives of ketones,  ethers, esters or amides of acids, alkyl- and aralkyl halides the corresponding n-monoalkylated compounds of hexamethylenetetramine were obtained. the quaternization of pyridine nitrogen in 5,6-benzoquinoline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, quinoline, 1,10-phenanthroline molecules with alkyl- or aralkylhalides was carried out. the susceptibility of gram-positive (streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (e. coli, salmonella cholerae suis, salmonella enteridis gartneri) microorganisms to synthesized quaternary ammonium  salts by disc difussion method has been detected. the bacteriostatic action of 0.5-1% solutions of all compounds was assessed in comparison with benzalkonium chloride. it was shown, that the most effectiveness against all strains is possessed by quaternary hexamethylenetetramine ammonium salts, and especially salts, containing 1-propynyl- or hydroxycarbamoylmethyl radicals. the action of these two compounds against salmonella and streptococcus was stronger than the action of benzalkonium chloride. susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to these compounds were detected. it was shown, that 1% solutions of chlorides of n-(1-propynyl) hexamethylenetetramonium and n-(hydroxycarbamoylmethyl) hexamethylenetetrammonium demonstrate the same bacteriostatic action against p. aeruginosa as well as benzalkonium chloride.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == immunochemical characterization of an igg-binding protein of streptococcus suis.
AB  == several bacterial species express surface proteins with affinity for the constant region (fc) of immunoglobulin (ig) of different animal species. previous studies  from our group have reported the presence of an igg-binding protein in various serotypes of streptococcus suis. this molecule was also shown to bind in a non-immune fashion chicken igy and to our knowledge this characteristic is unique. in the present study, by dot-blotting, we showed that the native protein, obtained by affinity chromatography, reacted more strongly with igg from various  animal species than the denatured material. using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the affinity of the native 60-kda protein (previously identified as a 52-kda protein) towards igg of various animal species was compared to pig igg. bovine, goat and human igg were able to compete effectively  with pig igg whereas chicken igy constituted a poor competitor. peptide mapping analysis using denatured protein indicated that pig and bovine igg recognized the same proteolytic fragment whereas chicken igy did not. the smallest proteolytic fragment that retained the binding activity towards the igg of the different animal species tested had a molecular mass of approximately 40 kda. fragments with mr < 40 kda showed specific binding activities. that is, the smallest fragment binding pig and bovine igg had a mr of 30 kda whereas for goat and human igg a fragment of less than 16 kda still showed binding activity. finally, we observed that antisera raised against a heat-shock protein of pseudomonas aeruginosa reacted with the 60-kda s. suis protein indicating that the s. suis 60-kda protein is a member of the 60-kda hsp family that possesses the characteristic of binding in a non-immune way mammalian igg and chicken igy.

TI  == cleavage of influenza a virus h1 hemagglutinin by swine respiratory bacterial proteases.
AB  == cleavage of influenza a virus hemagglutinin (ha) is required for expression of fusion activity and virus entry into cells. extracellular proteases are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage activation of avirulent avian and mammalian influenza viruses and contribute to pathogenicity and tissue tropism. the relative contributions of host and microbial proteases to cleavage activation in natural infection remain to be established. we examined 23 respiratory bacterial pathogens and 150 aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from the nasal cavities of pigs for proteolytic activity. no evidence of secreted proteases was  found for the bacterial pathogens, including haemophilus parasuis, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, and streptococcus suis. proteolytic bacteria were isolated from 7 of 11 swine nasal samples and included staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus hyicus, aeromonas caviae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and enterococcus sp. only p. aeruginosa secreted a protease, elastase, that cleaved influenza virus ha. however, compared to trypsin, the site of cleavage by elastase was shifted one amino acid in the carboxy-terminal direction and resulted in inactivation of the virus. under the conditions of this study, we identified several bacterial isolates from the respiratory tracts of pigs that secrete proteases in vitro. however, none of these proteolytic isolates demonstrated direct cleavage activation of influenza virus ha.

TI  == enhancement of host resistance to bacterial infections in normal and immunosuppressed mice with actinobacillus suis.
AB  == a single intraperitoneal (ip) inoculation of heat-killed actinobacillus suis atcc 15,557 (as 15,557) into normal and immunosuppressed (dexamethasone-treated) mice  led to remarkable nonspecific resistance to ip challenge with lethal doses of opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans. the duration of this enhanced protective action and the minimal effective dose, in normal mice, induced by as 15,557 were superior to those induced by other bacterial immunostimulants such as heat-killed lavtobacillus casei yit 9018 (lc 9018) and penicillin-treated streptococcus pyogenes, su (ok-432). in immunosuppressed mice; the reduced in vivo killing activity of peritoneal exudate cells (pecs) against p. aeruginosa infection was markedly augmented by ip injection of as 15,557. the degree of pec  augmentation induced by as 15,557 was higher than that induced by lc 9018 or by ok-432. the toxicity and histopathological changes associated with as 15557 were  very low, as compared with those by produced by lc 9018 and ok-432. the results suggest that as 15,557, which showed a strong resistance-enhancing capacity against opportunistic bacterial infections, may be a useful bacterial immunostimulant.

TI  == cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. in a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. the data were unsuitable for  determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. all strains of streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of actinobacillus  suis were highly susceptible to the drug (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (mic 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be  highly resistant to cefadroxil (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
