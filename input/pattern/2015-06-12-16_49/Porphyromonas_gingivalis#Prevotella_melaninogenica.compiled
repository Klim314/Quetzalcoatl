TI  - The effect of blue light on periodontal biofilm growth in vitro.
AB  - We have previously shown that blue light eliminates the black-pigmented oral bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella melaninogenica. In the present study, the in vitro photosensitivity of the above black-pigmented microorganisms and four Fusobacteria species (Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. nucleatum, F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, F. nucleatum ss. polymorphum, Fusobacterium periodonticum) was investigated in pure cultures and human dental plaque suspensions. We also tested the hypothesis that phototargeting the above eight key periodontopathogens in plaque-derived biofilms in vitro would control growth within the dental biofilm environment. Cultures of the eight bacteria were exposed to blue light at 455 nm with power density of 80 mW/cm2 and energy fluence of 4.8 J/cm2. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of bacteria was performed to demonstrate the presence and amounts of porphyrin molecules within microorganisms. Suspensions of human dental plaque bacteria were also exposed once to blue light at 455 nm with power density of 50 mW/cm2 and energy fluence of 12 J/cm2. Microbial biofilms developed from the same plaque were exposed to 455 nm blue light at 50 mW/cm2 once daily for 4 min (12 J/cm2) over a period of 3 days (4 exposures) in order to investigate the cumulative action of phototherapy on the eight photosensitive pathogens as well as on biofilm growth. Bacterial growth was evaluated using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. The selective phototargeting of pathogens was studied using whole genomic probes in the checkerboard DNA-DNA format. In cultures, all eight species showed significant growth reduction (p < 0.05). HPLC demonstrated various porphyrin patterns and amounts of porphyrins in bacteria. Following phototherapy, the mean survival fractions were reduced by 28.5 and 48.2 % in plaque suspensions and biofilms, respectively, (p < 0.05). DNA probe analysis showed significant reduction in relative abundances of the eight bacteria as a group in plaque suspensions and biofilms. The cumulative blue light treatment suppressed biofilm growth in vitro. This may introduce a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.
TI  - A chlorhexidine-loaded biodegradable cellulosic device for periodontal pockets treatment.
AB  - Absorbent points widely used in endodontic therapy were transformed into bioresorbable chlorhexidine delivery systems for the treatment of the periodontal pocket by preventing its recolonization by the subgingival microflora. These paper points (PPs) were first oxidized to promote their resorption, then grafted with beta-cyclodextrin (CD) or maltodextrin (MD) in order to achieve sustained delivery of chlorhexidine. We investigated the oxidation step parameters through the time of reaction and the nitric and phosphoric acid ratios in the oxidizing mixture, and then the dextrin grafting step parameters through the time and temperature of reaction. A first selection of the appropriate functionalization parameters was undertaken in relation to the degradation profile kinetics of the oxidized (PPO) and oxidized-grafted samples (PPO-CD and PPO-MD). Samples were then loaded with chlorhexidine digluconate (digCHX), a widely used antiseptic agent in periodontal therapy. The release kinetics of digCHX from PPO-CD and PPO-MD samples were compared to PP, PPO and to PerioChip((R)) (a commercial digCHX containing gelatine chip) in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The cytocompatibility of the oxidized-grafted PP was demonstrated by cell proliferation assays. Finally, the disc diffusion test from digCHX loaded PPO-MD samples immersed in human plasma was developed on pre-inoculated agar plates with four common periodontal pathogenic strains: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Aggregatibacter actinomycetem comitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. To conclude, the optimized oxidized-dextrin-grafted PPs responded to our initial specifications in terms of resorption and digCHX release rates and therefore could be adopted as a reliable complementary periodontal therapy.
TI  - Molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - The human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. This study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. An in-depth 16S rRNA gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. A complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. This included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found in all samples regardless of age and health status. Yet, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected in children. In contrast, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. Obligate anaerobes like Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of Porphyromonas and Prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Tannerella forsythia. Unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptococcus intermedius and Prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were scarce. The findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. The study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.
TI  - Does periodontopathic bacterial infection contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis?
AB  - There is a significant association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontal disease (PD). Patients with longstanding active RA have been found to have a substantially increased frequency of PD compared with healthy subjects. Further, patients with PD have been shown to have a higher prevalence of RA than patients without periodontitis. Antibodies to Gram-negative, anaerobic periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Tannerella forsythia have been detected in the serum and synovial fluid of RA patients. These pathogens have also been identified in the synovial fluid of RA patients, with higher levels of bacterial DNA in RA patients than in controls. This review examines the association between periodontopathic bacteria and the etiology of RA.
TI  - The short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects was performed. Bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: No halitosis (identified by VSC assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone, in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. At day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, Fusobacterium sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Tannerella forsythia. A decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: P. gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, S. aureus, and Treponema denticola. Baseline VSC scores were correlated with several bacterial species. The use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of VSC compared to rinsing alone. CONCLUSIONS: VSC scores were not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. The active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. Tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.
TI  - A 6-month study of the effects of 0.3% triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on dental implants.
AB  - AIM: Supportive therapy to maintain dental implants is increasingly important. This study examined the effect of a 0.3% triclosan/2% copolymer dentifrice on oral biofilms and gingival inflammation (GI) on dental implants and peri-implant tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty adults with a dental implant and contra-lateral tooth were enrolled in this 6 month, double-blind, two-treatment, parallel group study. Sixty subjects were randomly assigned to a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice test group and 60 subjects to a fluoride dentifrice control group and instructed to brush twice daily for 6 months. At baseline, 3, and 6 months, a calibrated dentist assessed dental plaque, GI and collected supragingival dental plaque for microbiological analysis. RESULTS: Subjects in the triclosan/copolymer group demonstrated significantly lower levels of dental plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding on probing at 3 and 6 months at both the implant and contra-lateral tooth compared with the fluoride group (p<0.05). There were significantly fewer Gram-negative anaerobes in the triclosan/copolymer group (p<0.05) including >90% reductions in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Solobacterium moorei, and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: Twice daily use of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice may enhance dental implant maintenance by reducing dental plaque and GI.
TI  - The identification of genes specific to Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens using genomic subtractive hybridization.
AB  - Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens, which are often isolated from periodontal sites, were once considered two different genotypes of P. intermedia. Although the genomic sequence of P. intermedia was determined recently, little is known about the genetic differences between P. intermedia and P. nigrescens. The subtractive hybridization technique is a powerful method for generating a set of DNA fragments differing between two closely related bacterial strains or species. We used subtractive hybridization to identify the DNA regions specific to P. intermedia ATCC 25611 and P. nigrescens ATCC 25261. Using this method, four P. intermedia ATCC 25611-specific and three P. nigrescens ATCC 25261-specific regions were determined. From the species-specific regions, insertion sequence (IS) elements were isolated for P. intermedia. IS elements play an important role in the pathogenicity of bacteria. For the P. intermedia-specific regions, the genes adenine-specific DNA-methyltransferase and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase were isolated. The P. nigrescens-specific region contained a Flavobacterium psychrophilum SprA homologue, a cell-surface protein involved in gliding motility, Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845 glutathione peroxide, and Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 leucyl-tRNA synthetase. The results demonstrate that the subtractive hybridization technique was useful for distinguishing between the two closely related species. Furthermore, this technique will contribute to our understanding of the virulence of these species.
TI  - Methods for optimizing DNA extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time PCR.
AB  - Methods for the optimal extraction of genomic DNA for real-time PCR enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, Parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of DNA content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time PCR approach. Evidence was obtained that P. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded DNA from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. This nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mM diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol at 4 degrees C overnight. A final purification of the DNA to remove any potential PCR inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of DNA by real-time PCR and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.
TI  - The microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. METHODS: Microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the Dental School of the University of Athens, who were split into three age groups. A total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: All of the test species, except Parvimonas micra and Porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial profiles for the different oral surfaces. Supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of Actinomyces species and Green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the Yellow complex. The profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. Many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. Periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. Specifically, the Red complex species (Tannerella forsythia, P. gingivalis, Treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (P < 0.05) in all sample locations. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. Differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of Orange and Red complex species.
TI  - Selective antibacterial and apoptosis-modulating activities of mastic.
AB  - Mastic is a resinous exudate obtained from the stem and the main leaves of Pistacia lentiscus. We have reported the antiplaque effect of mastic-containing chewing gum on the oral cavity. We hypothesize that mastic may be a multifunctional food which has some beneficial pharmaceutical properties. The aim of this study was to assess the biological activity of solid and liquid types of mastic by cytotoxicity against fibroblasts, radical-scavenging activities and inhibitory effect on cell death of oral polymorphonuclear leukocytes (OPMNs). Mastic showed selective antibacterial action against Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella melaninogenica, but no anti-HIV activity. Among a total of thirteen human cell types, promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 was the most sensitive to the cytotoxicity of mastic, followed by myeloblastic leukemia (ML-1, KG-1), erythroleukemia (K-562), oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), glioblastoma (T98G, U87MG) and normal oral cells (gingival fibroblast, pulp cell, periodontal ligament fibroblast, most resistant). Mastic did not induce the differentiation of myelogenous leukemic cells into maturing cells with higher nitroblue tetrazolium-reducing activity, but induced apoptotic cell death, characterized by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation and a decline in the intracellular concentration of putrescine. The cytotoxicity of mastic against leukemic cells did not diminish during its storage. On the other hand, mastic inhibited the spontaneous apoptosis of OPMNs. Mastic showed hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity. The selective antibacterial and apoptosis-modulating activity of mastic suggests its possible beneficial effects on oral health.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - [Preparation and antibacterial activity of quaternary ammonium salt monomers].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prepare three quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) monomers, and to compare their antibacterial activities against four oral bacterial strains. METHODS: Three antibacterial monomers [methacryloxyethyl benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-BC), methacryloxyethyl m-chloro benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-m-CBC), methacryloxyethyl cetyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DMAE-CB)] were synthesized according to the general structure of target monomers. Their antibacterial effects were investigated using the broth dilution test on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica ). RESULTS: Three different monomers were successfully obtained. All the tested bacterial strains were susceptible to the three monomers, among which DMAE-CB exhibited the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.2 to 4.8 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: All these three QAS monomers have different antibacterial activities against four oral bacteria strains. The data indicate that DMAE-CB may be a candidate antibacterial agent for oral infectious diseases.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Lagos, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: Twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. Eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral centre. INTERVENTION: Adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. RESULTS: Two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. Sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001). Infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, Streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, Staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (Porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, Peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, Prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, Clostridium perfringens 3.2%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. The anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. Over 92% of the streptococci were sensitive to the beta-Lactams contrast low susceptibility with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.
TI  - Periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type I: report of three cases within a family.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentin dysplasia type I (DDI) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. It is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (PAL). In this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of DDI but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. METHODS: A 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of DDI. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. Subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The mother presented 34.9% of sites with PD > or =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with CAL > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with BOP; both daughters presented no sites with PD or CAL >3 mm and <10% of sites with BOP. Microbiologic analysis detected Gemella morbillorum, Neisseria mucosa, and Staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. The daughters showed high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (Porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (Fusobacterium periodonticum and F. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (Streptococcus gordonii) and purple (Veillonella parvula) complexes. The mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (N. mucosa, Prevotella melaninogenica, Treponema denticola, and V. parvula). CONCLUSION: A combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid PAL and to provide oral health in patients with DDI.
TI  - PCR-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using PCR method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. The presence of selected pathogens (Actinomyces israelii, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Tannerella forsythensis, Enterococcus faecium, Prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using PCR. RESULTS: T. denticola (P = .012, .02) and E. faecalis (P = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while P. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (P = .01, .015). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. METHODS: Samples were collected from the root canals using #15 Hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization techniques. RESULTS: The mean number of species per sample was 22. Enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), Campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), Leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), Neisseria mucosa (87.5%), Prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), Eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), Streptococcus anginosus (75%), and Veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. The species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), E. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), E. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), N. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), V. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), C. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), Treponema socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), Micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), Prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). Most of these species were also found in high proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  - Propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in Turkey and from Brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of EEP on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. All strains were susceptible and MIC values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. Propolis from Kazan-Ankara showed most effective MIC values to the studied microorganisms. MBC values of Kazan-Ankara EEP samples were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. Death was observed within 4 h of incubation for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for Prevotella oralis and Prevotella melaninogenica and Porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for Veillonella parvula. It was shown that propolis samples were more effective against Gram positive anaerobic bacteria than Gram negative ones. The organic chemical compositions of EEPs were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main compounds of EEPs were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. Because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.
TI  - Microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. METHODS: Ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. Subsequently, a period of 21 days of washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. Microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: The species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were Prevotella melaninogenica and Veillonella parvula. The mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). Proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSION: The tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.
TI  - Properties of hemagglutination by Prevotella melaninogenica.
AB  - Although Prevotella melaninogenica belongs to the commensal oral microbiota, some strains possess putative virulence factors. For example, we have previously described fimbriated, hemagglutinating strains of P. melaninogenica, isolated from patients with periodontal disease. The aim of this investigation was to compare some chemical and physical properties of hemagglutination (HA) of P. melaninogenica with those of other pigmented gram-negative anaerobes. HA of 13 P. melaninogenica strains proved to be considerably weaker than that of the major periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis. Vigorous shaking reduced HA of shaken cells but the shaken supernatant had the same hemagglutinating activity as non-shaken cells. The hemagglutinating agent on P. melaninogenica seemed to be a protein, which can be separated from the cell and binds to lactose-, galactose-, and raffinose-containing carbohydrates on the erythrocytes. Adherence to epithelial cells did not differ significantly between the hemagglutinating and non-hemagglutinating strains of P. melaninogenica. Although P. melaninogenica is able to agglutinate erythrocytes, this potential virulence factor is of a considerably lower magnitude than that of major periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Black stains in the mixed dentition: a PCR microbiological study of the etiopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this work is to emphasize that particular stains on the third cervical of the buccal and lingual surfaces in mixed dentition, called "black stain." Previous research showed the microbiological etiology of this discoloration by chromogen bacterias. Our study shows bacteria spp involved in stains by means of PCR process and electrophoresis gel on the agarose medium. Sample was formed by 100 subject with black stain and 100 control subjects stain-free. A statistical analysis (SPSS 10.0) using X2 was performed in this study. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella melaninogenica, were not involved in both in black stain subjects and in the control. On the contrary, Actinomyces could be involved in the pigmentation process.
TI  - Serum antibodies to oral anaerobic bacteria in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to determine the component that causes the disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which shows great resemblance to periodontitis in a pathologic context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within this study, the pathogen-specific IgG levels formed against Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC 381, Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4, Bacteroides forsythus ATCC 43047, and Prevotella intermedia 25611 oral bacteria were researched from the blood serum samples of 30 RA patients and 20 healthy controls with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. RESULTS: The IgG levels of P gingivalis, P intermedia, P melaninogenica, and B forsythus were found to be significantly higher in RA patients when compared with those of the controls. Of the other bacteria antibodies, A actinomycetemcomitans was not found at greater levels in RA serum samples in comparison with the healthy samples. CONCLUSION: The antibodies formed against P gingivalis, P intermedia, P melaninogenica, and B forsythus could be important to the etiopathogenesis of RA.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. METHODOLOGY: Saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. The subjects were asked to place the strip (Listerine PocketPaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. After 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C for seven days. Colony counts (CFU/mL) were determined for each sample. The colonies on the plates were washed with 1 mL of TE buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by DNA probes and the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by Wilcoxon sign rank and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: A modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). Most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels, including the pathogens A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, E. corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., P. intermedia, and S. noxia, as well as the beneficial species A. meyeri, A. georgia, A. gerencseriae, A. odontolyticus, and P. acnes after strip placement. In contrast, A. viscosus, P. melaninogenica, P. gingivalis, P. micros, Streptococcus spp., T. forsythensis, and V. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. These changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022). CONCLUSION: The use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. In addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.
TI  - Phototargeting oral black-pigmented bacteria.
AB  - We have found that broadband light (380 to 520 nm) rapidly and selectively kills  oral black-pigmented bacteria (BPB) in pure cultures and in dental plaque samples obtained from human subjects with chronic periodontitis. We hypothesize that this killing effect is a result of light excitation of their endogenous porphyrins. Cultures of Prevotella intermedia and P. nigrescens were killed by 4.2 J/cm2, whereas P. melaninogenica required 21 J/cm2. Exposure to light with a fluence of 42 J/cm2 produced 99% killing of P. gingivalis. High-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated the presence of various amounts of different porphyrin molecules in BPB. The amounts of endogenous porphyrin in BPB were 267 (P. intermedia), 47 (P. nigrescens), 41 (P. melaninogenica), and 2.2 (P. gingivalis) ng/mg. Analysis of bacteria in dental plaque samples by DNA-DNA hybridization for 40 taxa before and after phototherapy showed that the growth of the four BPB was decreased by 2 and 3 times after irradiation at energy fluences of 4.2 and 21 J/cm2, respectively, whereas the growth of the remaining 36 microorganisms was decreased by 1.5 times at both energy fluences. The present study suggests that intraoral light exposure may be used to control BPB growth and possibly benefit patients with periodontal disease.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates of prevotella and porphyromonas species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study determined the beta-lactamase production and the antimicrobial resistance of 72 Prevotella species and 48 Porphyromonas species isolated from different clinical specimens. METHODS: All strains were identified using API 32 ID. The beta-lactamase production was determined by nitrocefin disks. E test strips of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cefoxitin, clindamycin, metronidazole and imipenem were tested for each strain. RESULTS: Nineteen Prevotella melaninogenica, 18 Prevotella intermedia, 16 Prevotella denticola, 11 Prevotella loescheii and 8 Prevotella bivia strains were identified. Four were clindamycin resistant. The highest beta-lactamase production was found at a rate of 68.4% in P. melaninogenica species. Additionally, 33 Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and 15 Porphyromonas gingivalis strains were identified. None of them produced beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: In view of the emerging antibiotic resistance among anaerobes, the current local susceptibility profile of our Prevotella and Porphyromonas species will establish the basis for additional surveys tracing significant changes in the antimicrobial resistance of our clinical isolates.
TI  - Susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  - Since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (PMC) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. Both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola and Prevotella melaninogenica. The MIC of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the MIC of PMC from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. The highest MIC value of PMC was detected for E. faecalis whereas E. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. The highest MIC values of chlorhexidine were observed for P. aeruginosa whereas E. coli and P. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. Since the MIC values observed are much lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis subjects from different geographic locations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most clinical studies assume that the subgingival microbiota is similar from one geographic location to another. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in chronic periodontitis subjects from four countries. METHOD: Subjects with chronic periodontitis (N, Sweden=101; USA=115; Brazil=58; Chile=26) were recruited. Subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing (BOP), suppuration, pocket depth (PD) and attachment level (AL) at six sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples=6036). % DNA probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. Significance of differences in proportions of each species among countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p-Values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: On average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in the four countries. Thirteen species differed significantly in adjusted mean proportions among countries even after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Porphyromonas gingivalis, one species that differed in proportions among countries, comprised adjusted means of 7.5, 11.9, 1.6 and 6.6% of the microbiota in subjects from Brazil, Chile, Sweden and USA (p<0.001), while mean proportions of Treponema denticola were 6.7, 4.2, 0.8 and 2.3, respectively (p<0.001). In contrast, a key periodontal pathogen, Tannerella forsythensis, exhibited mean proportions ranging from 6.2-8.5% and did not differ significantly among countries. Besides these species, prominent species in Brazil were Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 (8.4%, 7.2%) and Prevotella intermedia (6.5%); in Chile, Prevotella melaninogenica (6.4%) and Neisseria mucosa (5.3%); in Sweden A. naeslundii genospecies 2 (8.4%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (7.1%) and Peptostreptococcus micros (5.0%); in USA A. naeslundii genospecies 2 (7.5%), P. intermedia (6.8%) and C. gingivalis (6.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from chronic periodontitis subjects in four countries showed surprisingly marked differences. These differences persisted after adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status.
TI  - Sensitivity of genera Porphyromonas and Prevotella to the bactericidal action of  C-terminal domain of human CAP18 and its analogues.
AB  - This paper reports the effect of the synthesized 27-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal domain of human CAP18 (hCAP18), a human cationic antibacterial protein or cathelicidin, on certain strains belonging to the genera Porophyromonas and Prevotella. The domain binds lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Porophyromonas gingivalis and Porophyromonas circumdentaria as well as enterobacterial LPS. Two analogues of hCAP18, designated LL/CAP18 and FF/CAP18, were also tested to determine whether additional activity was obtained. The analogue peptides replaced with hydrophobic and cationic amino acid residues showed more potent bactericidal and LPS-binding activities than the original one.
TI  - Distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". Saliva was taken by expectoration. Forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. Samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of total DNA probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. The significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the Quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. The proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and ANOVA. RESULTS: Microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects, with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. Proportions of Veillonella parvula and Prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. Cluster 1 comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while Cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. V. parvula, P. melaninogenica, Eikenella corrodens, Neisseria mucosa, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium periodonticum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii and Porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in Cluster 1 and S. mitis, S. oralis and S. noxia were significantly higher in Cluster 2. These findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. The microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the Actinomyces species. Species of different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus Streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. S. oralis, S. mitis and S. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. CONCLUSIONS: Proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. The microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. The microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.
TI  - Faropenem, a new oral penem: antibacterial activity against selected anaerobic and fastidious periodontal isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of faropenem, an oral penem, was compared with those of penicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefoxitin, clindamycin, erythromycin and metronidazole against 106 isolates of anaerobic pathogens involved in systemic infections. The organisms tested comprised Porphyromonas gingivalis (29), Prevotella spp. (eight), Prevotella melaninogenica (seven), Prevotella intermedia (five), Actinomyces spp. (25), Fusobacterium nucleatum (14), Peptostreptococcus spp. (11), Bacteroides ureolyticus (five) and Bacteroides forsythus (two). The antimicrobial properties of faropenem were investigated by studying MICs, MBCs, time-kill kinetics and post-antibiotic effect (PAE). Faropenem was highly active against all the anaerobes tested (MIC(90) < or = 0.5 mg/L) and was bactericidal against both beta-lactamase-positive and -negative anaerobes, with a maximum bactericidal effect at 10 x MIC at between 12 and 24 h. In addition, faropenem had an in vitro PAE on all the tested isolates and this was not influenced by beta-lactamase production. Faropenem may be useful for treating infections caused by periodontal bacteria or oral flora.
TI  - [Study of bacteriology on local application of Tinidazole stilus in treatment for periodontitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to evaluate the antiseptic efficacy of Tinidazole stilus against periodontal pathogen. METHODS: A total of 41 patients with periodontitis were included in this study. 26 of them were treated by Tindazole stilus and other 15 cases were treated by metronidazole stilus as controls. The prevalence of subgingival bacteria from both group were examined. RESULTS: The eliminate rates for Black pigmented anaerobic rod (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedius, Prevotella melaninogenicus), Fusobacteriums, Prevotella oris, Prevotella oralis, Eubacterium and Actinomyces were 95.8% 94.1%, 83.3% and 76.5%. The anti-bacterial efficiency of Tinidazole against periodontal pathogen was significantly higher than that of metronidazole (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It appears to be effective to use Tinidazole stilus as local application against periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Frequency of reactivity for Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella spp. in supra- and subgingival plaques, and periodontal clinical parameters according to subject age.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study was conducted to assess the association between selected clinical parameters and the distribution of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Prevotella nigrescens (Pn), and Prevotella melaninogenica (Pm) in supra- and subgingival plaque samples measured by an immunoslot blot assay (IBA) using their monoclonal antibodies. METHODS: Plaque samples from 299 patients aged 6 to 69 randomly chosen from a group of dental outpatients were examined. Plaque index, gingival index, and probing depths were evaluated according to the criteria of positive (cell number > or = 10(6)) or negative (<106) reactivity to the 4 different monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: An increase in probing depth in subjects exhibiting either a positive or negative reaction for the 4 test bacteria was associated with increasing age. Comparing bacteria-positive subgingival plaque samples to their corresponding bacteria-negative counterparts, we found an increased plaque index in children positive for any of the 4 bacteria; in addition, that for Pg and Pi was increased in subjects 40 to 49 years old. The gingival index increased with increasing amount of Pi and Pn, but not with Pg and Pm in those 20 to 29 years of age. The frequency of Pg reactivity in subgingival plaque was markedly enhanced in subjects older than 30 to 39 years of age, and was significantly higher than that in supragingival plaque. The frequency of Pi and Pn reactivity was significantly increased in adults aged 20 to 29 and plateaued at older ages. The frequency of Pm reactivity was relatively low and independent of subject age. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in probing depth with increasing age was not affected by the occurrence of periodontopathic bacteria. The high rate of occurrence of Pg, together with Pi and Pn, in subgingival plaque of the adult age groups was suggested to be associated with the high frequency of periodontal disease in the older age groups (above 30 to 49 years of age). The IBA appears to be useful for the efficient and rapid detection of periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Quantitative microbiological study of human carious dentine by culture and real-time PCR: association of anaerobes with histopathological changes in chronic pulpitis.
AB  - The bacteria found in carious dentine were correlated with the tissue response of the dental pulps of 65 teeth extracted from patients with advanced caries and pulpitis. Standardized homogenates of carious dentine were plated onto selective and nonselective media under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions. In addition, real-time PCR was used to quantify the recovery of anaerobic bacteria. Primers and fluorogenic probes were designed to detect the total anaerobic microbial load, the genera Prevotella and Fusobacterium, and the species Prevotella melaninogenica, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Micromonas (formerly Peptostreptococcus) micros. The pulpal pathology was categorized according to the cellular response and degenerative changes. Analysis of cultured bacteria showed a predominance of gram-positive microorganisms, particularly lactobacilli. Gram-negative bacteria were also present in significant numbers with Prevotella spp., the most numerous anaerobic group cultured. Real-time PCR analysis indicated a greater microbial load than that determined by colony counting. The total number of anaerobes detected was 41-fold greater by real-time PCR than by colony counting, while the numbers of Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp. detected were 82- and 2.4-fold greater by real-time PCR than by colony counting, respectively. Real-time PCR also identified M. micros, P. endodontalis, and P. gingivalis in 71, 60, and 52% of carious samples, respectively. Correlation matrices of the real-time PCR data revealed significant positive associations between M. micros and P. endodontalis detection and inflammatory degeneration of pulpal tissues. These anaerobes have been strongly implicated in endodontic infections that occur as sequelae to carious pulpitis. Accordingly, the data suggest that the presence of high levels of these bacteria in carious lesions may be indicative of irreversible pulpal pathology.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of lactoperoxidase-generated hypothiocyanite upon black pigmented anaerobe growth.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro effect of lactoperoxidase with or without its substrates (hydrogen peroxide, thiocyanate) on the growth of 4 different black pigmented anaerobe (BPA) strains associated with the development and progress of periodontal diseases: Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, Prevotella intermedia NCTC 9336, Prevotella loescheii ATCC 15930, and Prevotella melaninogenica NCTC 9338. A 5-min lactoperoxidase-generated OSCN--HOSCN incubation at pH 6.0, 7.0 or 8.0 resulted in a decrease of the growth rate (tested by turbidimetry in liquid cultures) of the 4 BPA strains, whilst lactoperoxidase alone actually promoted bacterial growth.
TI  - A microbiological study of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. METHODS: Bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. Some isolates were also subjected to partial 16S rDNA sequencing. Plaque samples were also assayed for the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: The culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly Capnocytophaga spp and Streptococcus spp. The latter included S. constellatus, S. oralis, and S. sanguis. Other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. The aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. Anaerobic species included Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica, and P. nigrescens, as well as Peptostreptococcus spp. ELISA detected P gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. Prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PLS have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. However, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with PLS.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Inhibition of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxicity by bacteria from the subgingival flora.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces a pore-forming leukotoxin that lyses human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes. Certain proteolytic bacteria may coexist with A. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets. We aimed therefore to examine whether oral bacteria can modify the leukotoxicity of A. actinomycetemcomitans. A total of 55 strains representing 45 bacterial species of the subgingival flora were tested. Each strain was incubated with the highly toxic strain of A. actinomycetemcomitans HK 1519 and the leukotoxic activity of the suspension against human polymorphonuclear leukocytes was determined from the activity of the lactate dehydrogenase released upon lysis of the leukocytes. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella loeschii inhibited the leukotoxicity of A. actinomycetemcomitans cells as well as the activity of leukotoxin purified from the same strain. The bacterial strains without the ability to block leukotoxic activity also failed to destroy pure leukotoxin even after 5 h of incubation. The proteolytic degradation of leukotoxin by P. gingivalis was mainly dependent on the activity of the enzymes R- and K-gingipains. P. intermedia and P. nigrescens also degraded the leukotoxin by enzymes. The results imply a role of the periodontal microflora in modifying the virulence of A. actinomycetemcomitans by destroying its leukotoxin.
TI  - Differences in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of two periodontitis populations of different geographical origin. A comparison between Spain and The Netherlands.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the subgingival microbiota of two geographically distinct patient populations using identical clinical and bacteriological methods. Adult patients with a diagnosis of periodontitis were consecutively selected according to pre-defined clinical criteria. Microbiological samples were taken from the deepest four sites with bleeding. The samples were plated on blood agar plates, for the determination of the total anaerobic counts and identification of specific bacterial pathogens, and on TSBV and McConkey for isolation of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods, respectively. Thirty-one patients in Spain and 30 patients in The Netherlands were selected. Both patient groups showed similar clinical characteristics, both in terms of age, gender and periodontal clinical variables. A. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent (23.3% vs. 3.2%) in the Dutch group, while Porphyromonas gingivalis was significantly more prevalent (64.5% vs. 36.7%) in the Spanish group. Bacteroides forsythus and most commensal periodontal pathogens showed similar prevalences, except Peptostreptococcus micros that was significantly more frequent in the Dutch group (96.7% vs. 74.2%). In summary, the subgingival microbiota from the Spanish group was characterised by a high prevalence of P. gingivalis and low of A. actinomycetemcomitans, while the flora from the Dutch group was characterised by a high prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. micros.
TI  - "Checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum IgG responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). Smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject; 2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic DNA probes. Serum IgG antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. RESULTS: Cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. Corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. Heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). Higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Eubacterium nodatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula, and Actinomyces naeslundii in controls. Cases displayed higher IgG levels against P. gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against F. nucleatum, T. denticola, E. nodatum, and Capnocytophaga ochracea. Positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. In cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species out of which only one was positive (V. parvula). Both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. A logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. Smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. CONCLUSION: A combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.
TI  - Identifying clinically important gram-negative anaerobes from the oral cavity.
AB  - Gram-negative oral anaerobes have frequently been associated with periodontal disease, some species more frequently than others. The confusing classification of these organisms has often obscured the association with disease of particular species within this group of organisms. This investigation aimed to compare different identification methods that could be applied in clinical research. Clinical isolates were collected and identified by three different methods: screening with phenotypic tests, commercial identification kits, and a 16S rRNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Forty-three reference strains of 19 Prevotella and Porphyromonas species were also included in the investigation. The phenotypic screen easily differentiated Porph. gingivalis from the other pigmented species. The screen also gave a good indication of separation of the lactose-fermenting species from the lactose non-fermenting species, although diversity can be seen in beta-galactosidase activity. Commercial identification kits did not add much to identification achieved with the phenotypic screen, only 20% of Porph. gingivalis isolates could be identified to species level with the kits. Neither the kits nor the phenotypic screen could differentiate Pr. intermedia and Pr. nigrescens. With the PCR method, Pr. intermedia and Pr. nigrescens were easily separated, and Porph. gingivalis was readily identified. Because of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, Pr. melaninogenica and Pr. veroralis could not be separated by the PCR method.
TI  - Activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. Gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions. Peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii) and Porphyromonas spp. (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. The MICs of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium innocuum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Anaerobiospirillum spp., Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and the Prevotella oris-buccae group. Fusobacterium naviforme and Fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while Fusobacterium varium strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other Fusobacterium species, such as Fusobacterium ulcerans and Fusobacterium russii, as well as Veillonella spp., the Prevotella melaninogenica group, Prevotella bivia, Clostridium difficile, and Bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (MIC(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Association of black-pigmented bacteria with endodontic infections.
AB  - Black-pigmented bacteria (BPB) have been associated with endodontic infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate further the presence of BPB with the clinical signs and symptoms associated with endodontic infections. Microbial samples were collected from the root canals of 40 intact teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis. Conventional laboratory methods were used for identification of the strains of BPB isolated in pure culture. In addition, the polymerase chain reaction and specific primers for 16S r-RNA genes were used to differentiate Prevotella nigrescens from Prevotella intermedia. Twenty-two (55%) samples were positive for the growth of BPB. Of those, 11 of 22 (50%) were identified as P. nigrescens, 8 of 22 (36%) were P. intermedia, 2 of 22 (9%) were Porphyromonas gingivalis, and 1 of 22 (5%) was Prevotella melaninogenica. Sixteen of the 22 root canals positive for the growth of BPB were associated with purulent drainage either from the root canal or an associated sinus tract. Statistical analysis did not show a significant relationship for the presence of BPB with clinical signs and symptoms.
TI  - Relationship of the subgingival microbiota to a chairside test for aspartate aminotransferase in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF). METHODS: Thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. Within each subject, the AST contents of GCF from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. AST-positive site refers to one that had an AST level > or = 800 microIU. Subgingival plaque samples from one AST-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. One site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. Clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. Culture and immunofluorescence (IF) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga species, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the AST test and certain specific pathogens. RESULTS: The GCF scores and total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in AST-positive sites than either AST-negative or healthy sites. The prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as C rectus, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga species, P. intermedia, and P. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. In analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the AST test by logistic regression, only P. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. The odds ratio of having a high proportion of P. gingivalis in the presence of a positive AST test was 1.21. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that at AST-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. Although only the correlation of P. gingivalis and AST values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of AST levels in GCF.
TI  - Inflammatory cytokine production and specific antibody responses against possible causative bacteria in patients with multilesional periapical periodontitis.
AB  - We examined the induction of inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) by several species of possible causative bacteria in periapical periodontitis. Assays were done on human whole blood cultures from patients with differing numbers of periapical lesions; those having radiographically clear periapical lesions in 10 or more teeth (high lesion group), in one or two teeth (low lesion group), and healthy volunteers having no periapical lesions (no lesion group). Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845 induced interleukin-6 more strongly in subjects from the high lesion group than in the other groups. To ascertain the degree of sensitization by test bacteria, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in serum and saliva from the six subjects to different bacterial species. Porphylomonas gingivalis cells reacted strongly with sera from the high lesion group. Thus, Prevotella melaninogenica and Porphylomonas gingivalis may be involved in multilesional periapical periodontitis by inducing specific cytokines and/or humoral immune responses.
TI  - Comparison of lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Campylobacter and Wolinella spp. by tricine-SDS-PAGE.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of 11 bacterial strains from the type species of the genera Bacteroides (B. fragilis), Prevotella (Pr. melaninogenica), Porphyromonas (Po. gingivalis), Campylobacter (C. fetus subsp. fetus), and Wolinella (W. succinogenes), and from the type strains of B. distasonis, B. forsythus, B. ureolyticus, Po. levii, Po. macacae, and C. gracilis, were extracted with hot water-phenol (Westphal method). S-form LPSs, obtained from all organisms, were well resolved with tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. Lipid A was not stained. Also profiles from LPS of Escherichia coli, serotypes 0111:B4 and 055:B5, could be distinguished. While W. succinogenes showed a relatively short S-form LPS on electrophoregrams, the other bacteria, including B. fragilis, exhibited long-ladder LPSs. Po. gingivalis displayed the largest number of bands and the longest O-chain. The long O-chain of this bacterium may be important for its virulence.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  - Microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). The study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. In each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (P1, P2, M1, M2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). These teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). A 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with an external sling suture. With oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, S. mutans, S. sanguis, Selenomonas sputigena, T. denticola, and T. vincentii) were present. Semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and Pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (P < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. These results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.
TI  - Fermentation product analysis in the identification of black-pigmented bacteria from periodontitis.
AB  - A quantitative procedure is described for the analysis of fermentation products of eight representative black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobic bacterial strains (Porphyromonas gingivalis 381, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611, Prevotella nigrescens ATCC 33563, Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845, Prevotella denticola ATCC 33185, and Prevotella loescheii ATCC 15930) from oral sites in humans, using gas-liquid chromatography. This procedure for the identification of clinical isolates was carried out and the results were in agreement with those obtained by other chemical, biochemical and serological assays. The isolates were classified as Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and two serotype groups of Porphyromonas gingivalis, based on the quantity of fatty acids.
TI  - [The effect of tinidazole in the treatment of adult periodontitis].
AB  - Fifty-two adult periodontitis patients were treated by the tablets of tinidazole  (TNZ), and 23 patients treated by metronidazole (MNZ) served as control group. The effective rate of TNZ in adult periodontitis patients was 73.1%, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (43.5%). Antimicrobial studies showed that the capability of TNZ to kill the periodontal dominant anaerobic bacteria, especially B. gingivalis and B. melaninogenicus, was better than that of MNZ. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of TNZ to Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Veillonella, Eubacterium, Antinomyces, Peotostreptococus and Anaerobic Streptococus was lower than that of MNZ and actylspiramycine.
TI  - Phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation on biofilms of Porphyromonas and Prevotella species.
AB  - Species of Prevotella (Pr.) and Porphyromonas (Po.) and other microorganisms were cultivated as biofilms on agar medium and examined for their susceptibility to argon laser irradiation (continuous mode; wavelengths, 488-514 nm; fluences, 20-200 J cm(-2)). Fluences of 35 to 80 J cm(-2) inhibited biofilm growth in Po. endodontalis, Po. gingivalis, Pr. denticola, Pr. intermedia, Pr. melaninogenica and Pr. nigrescens. A fluence of 70 J cm(-2) did not affect biofilm growth in species of Bacillus, Candida, Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. The phototoxic effects of argon laser irradiation against Prevotella and Porphyromonas species were: (1) caused by the radiation alone; (2) modified by biofilm age; (3) dependent on the presence of atmospheric oxygen; (4) influenced by medium supplements of hemin, hemoglobin and blood; (5) greater when compared with other microbial species; (6) demonstrated without augmentation with an exogenous photosensitizer; and (7) apparently unrelated to the protoporphyrin content of the cells. Overall, these in vitro findings suggest that low doses of argon laser radiation may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of clinical infections caused by biofilm-associated species of Prevotella or Porphyromonas.
TI  - An investigation into the use of SDS-PAGE of cell surface extracts and proteolytic activity to differentiate Prevotella nigrescens and Prevotella intermedia.
AB  - By comparison of the cell surface proteins derived from the outer membrane and fibrils from 14 Prevotella intermedia and 19 Prevotella nigrescens strains using SDS and analysed by SDS-PAGE, it was possible to distinguish the two species. A polypeptide of approx. 21 kDa distinguished P. intermedia strains, whereas two polypeptides of approx. 18 and 22 kDa could be used to identify P. nigrescens strains. Four other human oral black pigmented bacterial species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella melaninogenica) did not have the 18-, 21- or 22-kDa polypeptides shown by P. intermedia or P. nigrescens. The cell-associated proteolytic activity of eight strains of P. intermedia, 14 strains of P. nigrescens and one strain of P. gingivalis (W50) was assessed using four chromogenic substrates. The hydrolysis of the substrate GPPNA (indicative of dipeptidyl peptidase IV-like activity) and SAAPPNA (elastase-like activity) by P. intermedia strains varied from 32 to 114 units and 0.5 to 12.6 units of activity respectively, where one unit was defined as the amount of protease enzyme catalysing the formation of 1 nmol of p-nitroaniline under experimental conditions. 37.5% (3 of 8) of P. intermedia strains hydrolysed SAAPPNA (chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity) with activities of between 7 and 12 units. The hydrolysis of GPPNA and SAAAPNA by P. nigrescens strains was 32-149 and 3-16 units, respectively. 57% (8 of 14) of P. nigrescens strains hydrolysed SAAPPPNA with activities ranging from 3 to 8 units. None of the P. intermedia or P. nigrescens strains examined were found to have trypsin-like enzyme activity (BAPNA hydrolysis). The GPPNA and SAAAPNA hydrolytic activity associated with the proteases from Porphyromonas gingivalis W50 was at least twice that of P. intermedia and P. nigrescens strains. The similar peptidase activities of P. intermedia and P. nigrescens against chromogenic substrates cannot be used to differentiate the species, but SDS-PAGE of cell surface protein extracts allowed unambiguous speciation between P. intermedia and P. nigrescens. This simple technique of cell surface protein analysis can be performed in most laboratories and offers a convenient way by which to differentiate the two species.
TI  - Cell envelope and cell wall immunization of Macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  - The nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. Animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, and Actinomyces viscosus. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. P. gingivalis and P. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. The high P. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low P. gingivalis numbers being recovered. P. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable P. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella buccae, Bacteroides macacae and Prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp. and Eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. Campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of Fusobacterium spp. decreased. Plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. Pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth. Attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups, and the F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. Radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. Although immunization with P. gingivalis and P. intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted in greater bone loss than immunization with F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.
TI  - Correlation of the periodontal status 6 years after puberty with clinical and microbiological conditions during puberty.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the oral clinical and microbiological status of young adults 6 years after puberty and to compare these findings with the conditions observed during puberty. Clinical and microbiological parameters were monitored in 42 individuals 10 x between the ages of 11 and 14 years. 33 individuals were re-examined 10 years after the start of this monitoring. Microbiology included 2 subgingival samples per subject taken from the mesiobuccal aspects of the upper 1st molars. The samples were subject to continuous anaerobic culturing. Individuals with a marked and sustained increase in mean papillary bleeding scores during puberty (group A, n = 16) differed 6 years later from individuals without pronounced puberty gingivitis (group C, n = 8) in several aspects. Individuals in group A had a significantly higher gingival bleeding tendency and an increased number of sites with more than 3 mm attachment loss. The subjects in group C showed the lowest anaerobic total cultivable counts. Spirochetes were detected only in group A subjects (4 samples in 3 individuals). In all positive sites, spirochetes had been identified at least 8 out of 10 times during puberty. A. actinomycetemcomitans was present in only one individual of group A. P. gingivalis had not been detected during puberty; none of the samples were P. gingivalis positive 6 years later. P. intermedia was found in 27% of all samples, isolates belonging to the P. melaninogenica group of black pigmenting anaerobes had a frequency of 6%, 6 years after puberty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Periodontopathogens in elderly Chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  - If an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. To test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural Chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group, each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. Assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. Subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia group, Prevotella melaninogenica group, Capnocytophaga, Selenomonas, Campylobacter rectus as well as predominant Streptococcus and Actinomyces species. During the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. The latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "Best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and Actinomyces recovery. Similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. It is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.
TI  - Succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  - This report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. Tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. Tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. Microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. After implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly elevated. Following fixture placement, P. intermedia replaced P. melaninogenica as the predominant Black Pigmented Anaerobic Bacilli (BPAB) in the mouth. After abutment connection stage, levels of P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatun, Haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. Three months after bridge installations, P. intermedia and A. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. At six months after bridge installation, levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months. Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their levels correlated with gingival redness. P. intermedia, Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. Correlation was detected between P. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum. Our studies show a transitional increase in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their levels.
TI  - Oligonucleotide probes to the 16S ribosomal RNA: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens.
AB  - Eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16S ribosomal RNA  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens. The 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. Alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated I Bi-2 to I Bi-6 (for P. intermedia) and 2Bi-2 (for P. nigrescens) with the 16S rRNA suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. A 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated Bi) reliably detected both species. Because of the high degree of concordance between the 16S rRNAs of both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. Thus probe I Bi-I recognised P. intermedia while I Bi-I detected both P. intermedia and P. nigrescens at low stringency. However, under conditions of high stringency only P. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2Bi-I. These probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with DNA from the closely related P. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as Prevotella melaninogenica, P. denticola, P. loescheii, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Py. endodontalis, Py. gingivalis, Py. levii, and Py. macacae.
TI  - Immunobiological activities of a 55-kilodalton cell surface protein of Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611.
AB  - A protein was extracted from whole cells of Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 with sodium lauroylsarcosine and purified by chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose fast-flow column. The The apparent molecular weight of the protein was 55,000. A mouse polyclonal antibody specific for the protein recognized the cell surface structure of P. intermedia and also reacted with proteins in lysates of other black-pigmented anaerobic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas endodontalis and Prevotella melaninogenica, but not with those in lysates of Porphyromonas gingivalis or with the purified fimbriae of P. gingivalis 381. The N-terminal sequence of the 55-kDa protein showed only low homology with the cell surface proteins of any black-pigmented bacteria reported to date. The level of immunoglobulin G antibody to the antigen was higher in the sera of patients with periodontitis than in the sera of healthy volunteers. The protein induced interleukin-1 alpha, -1 beta, -6, and -8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures and interleukin-1 beta and -6 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cell and gingival fibroblast cultures. The protein induced interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha activities in peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeJ as well as from C3H/HeN mice and also induced cytokine activities in the sera of both strains of mice primed with muramyldipeptide.
TI  - The lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis is not antigenically cross-reactive with that of other species.
AB  - Large numbers of Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Bacteroides strains were screened by 3 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and 8 rabbit antisera raised against Porphyromonas gingivalis, in order to detect any possible recognition of non-P. gingivalis surface antigens by these immunoreagents. All three MAbs, which were LPS-specific, extensively recognized LPS from 10 P. gingivalis strains in immunoblotting, whereas they recognized none of the 34 non-P. gingivalis strains. Rabbit antisera were similarly specific for P. gingivalis cells in immunofluorescence and with LPS in grid-blotting, but several of them recognized LPS from one Prevotella melaninogenica and 5 Prevotella intermedia strains in Western blotting. Since several pre-immune sera and an irrelevant serum raised to a Streptococcus species recognized up to 5 of these preparations, we exclude that the reactions were due to antigens shared by P. gingivalis and Prevotella. Rather, we consider that they were false-positive reactions due to natural antibodies, stimulated in a non-specific manner upon immunization with P. gingivalis, in animals whose immune systems were sensitized to Prevotella species before immunization.
TI  - Phylogeny of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  - The phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (CFB) phylum was examined by 16S rRNA sequence comparative analysis. Approximately 95% of the 16S rRNA sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonas and related species by a modified Sanger sequencing method. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. The bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. The first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of Prevotella, including P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and the ruminal species P. ruminicola. Two oral species, P. zoogleoformans and P. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus Prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. These two species and six species of Bacteroides, including the type species B. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. The third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. The first contained Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, P. asaccharolytica, P. circumdentaria, P. salivosa, [Bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [Bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [Bacteroides] forsythus and [Bacteroides] distasonis. [Bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. With few exceptions, the 16 S rRNA data were in overall agreement with previously proposed reclassifications of species of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas. Suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.
TI  - Isolation of periodontal species after guided tissue regeneration.
AB  - One advanced localized periodontal lesion in each of 10 patients was treated using the guided tissue regeneration procedure. Six weeks after placement of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes, microbial samples were taken from each treated site and the membranes were removed. Six weeks later the cases were re-evaluated. They had all healed successfully with varying amounts of gain of clinical attachment. Gram-negative, anaerobic rods were found in all samples and made up 31% of all organisms cultivated. In 1 patient, Porphyromonas gingivalis was found in a proportion of 17.5%. Six of the other 9 patients harbored Prevotella intermedia (mean proportion 21.3%) and 6 Prevotella melaninogenica (6.8%). Fusobacterium and Capnocytophaga were also frequently found. The results demonstrate that ePTFE membranes are frequently colonized by periodontal microorganisms. The importance of bacterial colonization on clinical success is presently not known. Further studies are needed to determine the effect of the presence or absence of putative pathogens during guided tissue regeneration.
TI  - Black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in periodontitis.
AB  - Black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes have been associated with periodontal disease and tooth loss since they were first isolated by Burdon in 1928. Porphyromonas gingivalis, which is usually not isolated from children, adolescents or adults with no periodontal breakdown, has been recognized as one of the most important periodontopathogens. Its presence is strongly correlated with deep periodontal pockets, which are assumed to be its main habitat. Correlations have been shown also with attachment loss, clinical inflammation and serum antibody levels, indicating an aetiological role in the periodontal disease. Their pathogenicity in animal models resembling periodontal disease is documented. They are frequently isolated from periodontal abscesses. The relationship between Prevotella intermedia and periodontal disease is not clear. It is frequently isolated from advanced periodontitis, often as the only black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobic species; however, the prevalence in adults with no periodontal breakdown is high. It is found frequently in periodontal abscesses and in acute necrotizing and ulcerative gingivitis. Serogroup I is found predominantly in deep periodontal pockets, whereas all serogroups (I-III) are found in shallow pockets and gingivitis. No conclusive difference in pathogenicity between serogroups has been found. Pr. melaninogenica, Pr. denticola and Pr. loescheii are frequently found in the gingival crevice in preschool children and other age groups with gingivitis, but are seldom found in deep periodontal pockets.
TI  - Classification of black-pigmented anaerobes by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS)  and conventional tests (CTs).
AB  - Clinical (66: dental 53; vaginal 4; wound 9) and reference (5*) strains of pigmented Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli were examined in pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS) and conventional tests (CTs). The strains were identified in CTs as: Prevotella intermedia (48*); Pr. melaninogenica (1); Pr. corporis (7); Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (12*); P. endodontalis (1*) and P. gingivalis (2*). Numerical classification based on CTs resolved five clusters comprising strains identified as (I) Pr. corporis, (II) Pr. melaninogenica, (III) Pr. intermedia, (IV) P. gingivalis and (V) P. asaccharolytica and P. endodontalis. Numerical classification based on PMS showed a similar division, with decreasing homogeneity in the order Pr. intermedia, Pr. corporis, P. asaccharolytica, in agreement with the ordering of homogeneity for these species in CTs. PMS clusters corresponding the Porphyromonas spp. were clearly distinct from those of Prevotella spp. PMS and CT classifications disagreed on cluster membership for only six of the strains. PMS identification from blind challenge sets agreed with conventional identification for 64 of 67 strains.
TI  - Occurrence of plasmids in black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes.
AB  - Black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes are causative agents of pyogenic infections and are closely linked to various forms of periodontal diseases. Whereas many studies have shown a high incidence of plasmids in intestinal Bacteroides spp., there have been only a few reports of plasmid analyses in pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes. According to previous reports and confirmed in this study, plasmids can be present in Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Prevotella intermedia, Pr. melaninogenica, and B. levii but have not been detected in P. gingivalis or other black-pigmented species. There were no correlations between plasmids and phenotypes such as resistance to antibiotics or bacteriocinogenicity. The highest carriage rate was found in isolates from cases of chronic otitis media, but the relationship between this site of infection and a high incidence of plasmids could be incidental. The size of plasmids ranged from 1.5 to 29 MDa. Plasmids with molecular weight > 10 MDa were described for the first time in these organisms. Repeated plasmid analyses showed that the plasmid patterns were generally stable.

TI  - Antimicrobial action of AXOL on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial action of AXOL was tested against a panel of periodontopathic bacteria, which included Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, Treponema sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The AXOL commercial solution (undiluted) was effective in inhibiting some of the bacteria but not all. The rational for the use of antimicrobials is discussed.
TI  - Microbiota associated with residual clefts and neighboring teeth in patients with cleft lip, alveolus, and palate.
AB  - Twenty patients with residual clefts or pronounced soft tissue grooves, treated for uni- or bilateral cleft lip, alveolus, and palate were included in this study. Ten patients were recalled for dental prophylaxis at regular intervals, 10 patients were not. One microbiologic sample was obtained from the cleft area and two samples from a tooth adjacent to the cleft (sites adjacent and distant to the cleft). Between the recall and the nonrecall group there were notable differences in the presence of anaerobic Gram-negative organisms. Fusobacterium spp., Prevotella melaninogenica, and P. intermedia were more often found in nonrecall patients. While rarely seen in recall patients, spirochetes and motile rods were a common feature of nonrecall patients. The putative periodontal pathogens Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were not detected in either group. The differences between the recall and the nonrecall groups were more pronounced when the respective samples from teeth were related to each other than when the samples obtained from the clefts were compared. The cleft flora was less complex irrespective of how good maintenance was and resembled the flora of teeth of well-maintained patients. Samples from clefts were never Wolinella positive, and harbored significantly less Capnocytophaga and Actinomyces viscosus than samples from dental sites.
TI  - Immunoglobulins in milk from cows immunized with oral strains of Actinomyces, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium.
AB  - Immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. A total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium. Two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. The mean percentages of IgG1, IgG2, IgM, and IgA in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. ELISA and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. The highest titers determined by ELISA belonged to the IgG1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. The concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by ELISA and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. The functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of Actinomyces, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Streptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, Capnocytophaga, and Wolinella. Minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. High-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.
TI  - Classification of oral pigmented anaerobic bacilli by pyrolysis mass spectrometry and biochemical tests.
AB  - Clinical (66) and reference (5) strains of pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, identified as Prevotella intermedia (47), Pr. melaninogenica (1), Pr. corpora (8), Porphyromonas asaccharolyticus (12), P. endodontalis (1) and P. gingivalis (2), were examined by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS) and in conventional tests. Numerical classification based on conventional test reaction patterns (CTRPs) resolved five clusters, four comprising strains identified as Pr. intermedia, Pr. corpora, Pr. melaninogenica, and P. gingivalis respectively, and one comprising strains identified as P. asaccharolyticus and P. endodontalis. Numerical classification based on PMS showed a similar division, with decreasing homogeneity of chemical composition in the order Pr. intermedia, Pr. corpora, P. asaccharolyticus, which agreed with the order of homogeneity in CTRPs. PMS clusters corresponding to the genus Porphyromonas were clearly distinct from those of the genus Prevotella. PMS and CTRP classification disagreed on cluster membership for six strains. PMS identification from blind challenge sets was in agreement with conventional identification for 64 of 67 strains.
TI  - Microbiology of healthy and diseased periodontal sites in poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetics.
AB  - A group of poorly-controlled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients  were examined in a cross-sectional design for total microbial levels, microbial incidence, and the percent levels of selected periodontal microorganisms. These organisms were selected on the basis of prior reports that associated them with either periodontal disease or health. One periodontally-healthy and one periodontally-diseased site were examined in each IDDM patient. Increased levels of the periodontal pathogens Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., Bacteroides gracilis, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus (formerly Wolinella recta) were found at the periodontal diseased sites. Increased prevalence of the organisms P. intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., and C. rectus were found at the diseased sites. A significantly higher percentage of P. intermedia was found at the sites exhibiting deep pockets and attachment loss.
TI  - Periodontal bone loss in mice induced by different periodontopathic organisms.
AB  - Periodontal bone loss in mice orally inoculated with Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Pept. magnus and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was compared to that in sham-inoculated mice. Six-to-8-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with 1 x 10(5), 1 x 10(7) or 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units (c.f.u.) of bacteria in 50 microliters of medium. Ten mice received each concentration of bacteria and 10 sham-inoculated mice acted as controls. Five mice from each of the groups were killed 6 weeks after inoculation and the remaining five mice at 12 weeks. Right hemimandibles were defleshed, stained and bone loss was measured using an image analyser. All the organisms tested were associated with bone loss. Animals that had received Pept. anaerobius and Pept. magnus had up to 18% more bone loss than those sham inoculated. In contrast, mice inoculated with A. actinomycetemcomitans had up to 38% more bone loss than the sham-inoculated animals, this amount of loss occurring at the lowest inoculation of 1 x 10(5) c.f.u. These data demonstrate a differential ability of micro-organisms to cause periodontal bone loss in mice.
TI  - Putative periodontopathogens in "diseased" and "non-diseased" persons exhibiting  poor oral hygiene.
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of some putative periodonto-pathogens in "test" and "control" sites in "diseased" and "non-diseased" persons, respectively, from an adult rural Kenyan population exhibiting poor oral hygiene and widespread loss of attachment (LA). 14 persons (less than 35 years) were assigned to a "diseased" category on the basis of at least 4 sites with LA greater than or equal to 4 mm; at least 5 mm LA and a pocket greater than or equal to 4 mm interproximally in a lower incisor ("test" site): and less than 2 mm LA and no pocket greater than or equal to 4 mm distal to a lower canine or mesial to a lower first premolar ("control" site). Age-matched "non-diseased" persons were identified on the basis of no sites with LA greater than 2 mm and no pockets greater than or equal to 4 mm associated with LA. Paperpoint samples from test and control sites as well as a scraping sample from the dorsum of tongue were examined for presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, B. melaninogenicus group, Capnocytophaga, Selenomonas spp., and Wolinella recta. P. gingivalis was found in 79% of test sites and 36% of control sites in "diseased" persons, and in 18% and 35% of test and control sites, respectively, in "non-diseased" persons. "No other bacterial group discriminated significantly between test and control sites or between diseased and non-diseased subjects. The surprisingly high occurrence of P. gingivalis in non-diseased subjects, both subgingivally and on tongue, indicates that deep periodontal pockets are not prerequisite ecological environments for P. gingivalis establishment.
TI  - Human lactoferrin binding to Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and  Prevotella melaninogenica.
AB  - Human isolates of Porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 16), Prevotella intermedia n = 82) and Prevotella melaninogenica (n = 18) from diseased periodontal pockets were examined for interaction with human lactoferrin (HLf) in a standardized 125I-labeled protein binding assay. The highest HLf binding was found in P. intermedia strains, followed by P. gingivalis and P. melaninogenica. Further characterization of the interaction was performed with 1 representative strain from each species. HLf binding to P. gingivalis reached a saturation instantly and was optimal at pH 5.0-6.5. The corresponding values for P. melaninogenica were 90 min and pH 3.0-5.5. The HLf binding to the 2 strains seem to be nonspecific. In contrast, P. intermedia demonstrated specific binding, and a time-saturability within 60 min with an optimal uptake at pH 6.0-7.5. Scatchard analysis implied 45,000 receptors per cell with an affinity constant of 5.5 x 10(-7) M on P. intermedia strain 4H. The binding capacity in all 3 strains was affected by the culture medium. HLf binding components in these strains were susceptible to heat or proteases. Binding was eliminated in P. gingivalis and was enhanced in P. intermedia and P. melaninogenica by periodate treatment. Unlabeled HLf or bovine lactoferrin effectively displaced labeled HLf binding. Various proteins and carbohydrates did not inhibit HLf binding. Our data suggest that HLf binds to these periodontitis-associated species and that this mechanism is distinct from the previously known ligand interactions in oral bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Rapid presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by using 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives.
AB  - A rapid method for presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods was developed. Using filter paper spot tests for indole production, sialidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-fucosidase, and trypsinlike enzyme activities, 100% of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Bacteroides levii and 89% of Prevotella corporis isolates were correctly identified to the species level. Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis could not be differentiated from each other but could be distinguished from all other species tested. Similarly, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, and Prevotella melaninogenica could not be differentiated from each other. The methods described are based on 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives of the various substrates and are simple to perform, rapid (less than 15 min), and applicable to difficult-to-cultivate anaerobic rods.
TI  - Clinical documentation and occurrence of putative periodontopathic bacteria in human immunodeficiency virus-associated periodontal disease.
AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated gingivitis (HIV-G) and HIV-associated periodontitis (HIV-P) are two intraoral lesions manifested by patients with HIV infection. Periodontal indices were measured for 87 subjects in 5 study groups: HIV-seropositive patients with healthy periodontium (HIV-H), with HIV-G, or with HIV-P; and non-HIV-infected subjects with healthy periodontium (H) or with adult chronic periodontitis (P). The quantitative clinical parameters were compared and statistically significant intergroup differences were noted. The mean scores on PI and PD do not discriminate between HIV-seropositive and non-HIV-infected seronegative cohorts, but a significant difference in the GI between HIV-H and H was noted. When categories of PD and AL are examined, some differences become apparent. Generally, the PD and AL of HIV-P are not as great as those of P. PI correlates well with GI (r = 0.86) in P, but does not (r = 0.33) in HIV-P. In addition, the occurrence of selected putative periodontopathic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, spirochetes, and motile eubacteria) in these lesions was determined by brightfield (after staining), darkfield and immunofluorescent microscopy. No difference in microbiological profile in the bacterial groups monitored was found between P and HIV-P. Spirochetes were found to be more abundant than P. gingivalis in the lesions of P and HIV-P. In marked contrast, P. gingivalis was found to be in highest numbers in samples from the gingival crevice of H as determined by indirect immunofluorescence.
TI  - Cross-inhibition between black-pigmented Bacteroides species.
AB  - Cross-inhibition within the group of black-pigmented Bacteroides, including both  oral and non-oral strains, was studied by means of a membrane filter technique. It was found that B. gingivalis possessed the most extended inhibitory capacity among all species tested. B. gingivalis showed inhibitory activity against B. intermedius, B. endodontalis, B. loescheii, and B. melaninogenicus. B. endodontalis was active against some B. intermedius strains. Among the saccharolytic species, some B. melaninogenicus strains were inhibitory for some B. endodontalis strains, some B. gingivalis strains, and some B. intermedius strains. These inhibitory activities observed in vitro may play a role in the colonization of the periodontal pocket.
