TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy?
AB  == heart valve repair or replacement is a serious problem. patients can benefit from an open dialogue between both cardiologists and gastroenterologists for the optimal effective patients care. the focused update on infective endocarditis of  the american college of cardiology/american heart association 2008 (acc/aha guidelines) and guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective endocarditis (new version 2009) of the european society of cardiology (esc guidelines) describe prophylaxis against infective endocarditis (ie) as not  recommended for gastroscopy and colonoscopy in the absence of active infection but increasing evidence suggests that the role of ie antibiotic prophylaxis remains a dark side of the cardio-oncology prevention. new evidences concerning infective endocarditis due to streptococcus bovis, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, and new findings indicate that there is a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in  patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy especially in elderly patients and in cancer and immunocompromised patients, to avoid serious consequences.

TI  == trends in diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis: a review.
AB  == mastitis (inflammation of mammary gland) is a most devastating disease condition  in terms of economic losses occurring throughout the world. the etiological agents may vary from place to place depending on climate; animal species and animal husbandry and include wide variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria; and fungi. they may be either contagious viz. staphylococcus aureus; streptococcus agalactiae or environmental viz. s. dysgalactiae, s. uberis, corynebacterium bovis and coagulase negative staphylococcus. conventional diagnostic tests viz. california mastitis test (cmt); r-mastitest and mast-o-test methods are applied under field conditions; whereas somatic cell count and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc) are useful for early mastitis detection and detection of sub clinical or chronic mastitis respectively. in vitro culture based diagnosis require further study as they can detect only viable cells. the advent of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technology along with its various versions like multiplex and real time pcr has improved the rapidity and sensitivity of diagnosis. circulating micro rna (mirna) based diagnosis; immune assay and proteomics based detection along with biochips and biosensors prove to  be asset to diagnosticians for advanced diagnosis of this economically important  condition. improvement of milking hygiene; implementation of post-milking teat disinfection; regular control of the milking equipments; implementation of milking order; improvement of bedding material are the general measures to prevent new cases of mastitis. the use of antibiotics (intramammary infusions; bacteriocins) and herbs (terminalia spp.) are important for prophylaxis and therapeutics. vaccines viz. cell based; recombinant (staphylococcal enterotoxin type c mutant) or chimeric (paua); live (s. uberis 0140j stain based) and bacterial surface extract based; dna-based and dna-protein based have greatly aided in management of bovine mastitis. quorum sensing and disease resistant breeding using novel biomarkers viz. toll like receptors (tlr) 2 and 4, interleukin (il) 8; breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (brca1) and calcium channel voltage-dependent alpha 2/delta sub unit 1 (cacna2d1) are also indispensable. this mini review gives an overview of all these different aspects  that act as trend setters as far as the diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis  is concerned to help the diagnosticians; epidemiologists and researchers not to remain ignorant about this grave condition.

TI  == cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies using quantitative real-time pcr and  bacterial culture to identify contagious mastitis cases in large dairy herds.
AB  == diagnostic strategies to detect contagious mastitis caused by mycoplasma bovis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae in dairy herds during an outbreak have been minimally studied with regard to cost and diagnostic sensitivity. the objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for identification of infected cows in two california dairy herds during contagious mastitis outbreaks. m. bovis was  investigated in a subset of a herd (n=1210 cows) with an estimated prevalence of  2.8% (95% ci=1.9, 3.7), whereas staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae were studied  in a second herd (n=351 cows) with an estimated prevalence of 3.4% (95% ci=1.5, 5.3) and 16.8% (95% ci=12.9, 20.7), respectively. diagnostic strategies involved  a combination of testing stages that utilized bacterial culture, quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr), or both. strategies were applied to individual or pooled samples of 5, 10, 50 or 100 samples. culture was considered the gold standard for sensitivity estimation of each strategy. the reference strategy was the strategy  with the lowest cost per culture-positive cow which for both m. bovis and strep.  agalactiae consisted of 2 stages, culture of samples in pools of 5 followed by culture of individual samples in positive pools with a sensitivity of 73.5% (95%  ci: 55.6, 87.1) and 96.6% (95% ci: 27.7, 84.8), respectively. the reference strategy for staph. aureus consisted of 3 stages, culture of individual samples in pools of 100 (stage 1), culture constituents of those positive from stage 1 in pools of 5 (stage 2), culture constituents of those positive from stage 2 individually (stage 3) which resulted in a sensitivity of 58.3% (95% ci: 88.3, 99.6). the most cost-effective alternative to the reference strategy was whole herd milk culture for all 3 pathogens. qpcr testing was a component of the second most cost-effective alternative for m. bovis and the third most cost-effective alternatives for the 3 pathogens. a stochastic model was used to assess the effect of prevalence or herd size on the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies. in the current study, increasing the prevalence of mastitis did not alter the ranking of strategies by cost-effectiveness. however, larger herds could benefit from testing larger pools such as 50 or 100 samples to improve cost-effectiveness. several diagnostic strategy options exist to identify contagious mastitis in herds, decisions should be based on cost and sensitivity of the strategies available.

TI  == construction of isogenic mutants in streptococcus gallolyticus based on the development of new mobilizable vectors.
AB  == streptococcus gallolyticus is an emerging cause of infective endocarditis that has been epidemiologically linked to colorectal cancer. s. gallolyticus is poorly transformable using electroporation and no defined mutant has been published yet. hence, we used mobilization to introduce plasmid dna from streptococcus agalactiae into s. gallolyticus using the transfer origin of the conjugative element tngbs1 (orittngbs1), followed by a classical homologous recombination technique. two isogenic mutants of s. gallolyticus ucn34, one deleted for the pil1 pilus operon and another for the sortase a gene, were constructed and characterized. this genetic tool should help in unravelling virulence mechanisms  of this bacterium.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == dynamics of fecal microbial communities in children with diarrhea of unknown etiology and genomic analysis of associated streptococcus lutetiensis.
AB  == background: the sequences of the 16s rrna genes extracted from fecal samples provide insights into the dynamics of fecal microflora. this potentially gives valuable etiological information for patients whose conditions have been ascribed to unknown pathogens, which cannot be accomplished using routine culture methods. we studied 33 children with diarrhea who were admitted to the children's hospital in shanxi province during 2006. results: nineteen of 33 children with diarrhea could not be etiologically diagnosed by routine culture and polymerase chain reaction methods. eleven of 19 children with diarrhea of unknown etiology had streptococcus as the most dominant fecal bacterial genus at admission. eight of nine children whom three consecutive fecal samples were collected had streptococcus as the dominant fecal bacterial genus, including three in the streptococcus bovis group and three streptococcus sp., which was reduced during and after recovery. we isolated strains that were possibly from the s. bovis group from feces sampled at admission, which were then identified as streptococcus lutetiensis from one child and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from two children. we sequenced the genome of s. lutetiensis and identified five antibiotic islands, two pathogenicity islands, and five unique genomic islands. the identified virulence genes included hemolytic toxin cylz of  streptococcus agalactiae and sortase associated with colonization of pathogenic streptococci. conclusions: we identified s. lutetiensis and s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus from children with diarrhea of unknown etiology, and found pathogenic islands and virulence genes in the genome of s. lutetiensis.

TI  == characterization of a new camp factor carried by an integrative and conjugative element in streptococcus agalactiae and spreading in streptococci.
AB  == genetic exchanges between streptococci occur frequently and contribute to their genome diversification. most of sequenced streptococcal genomes carry multiple mobile genetic elements including integrative and conjugative elements (ices) that play a major role in these horizontal gene transfers. in addition to genes involved in their mobility and regulation, ices also carry genes that can confer  selective advantages to bacteria. numerous elements have been described in s. agalactiae especially those integrated at the 3' end of a trna(lys) encoding gene. in strain 515 of s. agalactiae, an invasive neonate human pathogen, the ice (called 515_trna(lys)) is functional and carries different putative virulence genes including one encoding a putative new camp factor in addition to the one previously described. this work demonstrated the functionality of this camp factor (camp factor ii) in lactococcus lactis but also in pathogenic strains of veterinary origin. the search for co-hemolytic factors in a collection of field strains revealed their presence in s. uberis, s. dysgalactiae, but also for the first time in s. equisimilis and s. bovis. sequencing of these genes revealed the prevalence of a species-specific factor in s. uberis strains (uberis factor) and  the presence of a camp factor ii encoding gene in s. bovis and s. equisimilis. furthermore, most of the camp factor ii positive strains also carried an element  integrated in the trna(lys) gene. this work thus describes a camp factor that is  carried by a mobile genetic element and has spread to different streptococcal species.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == examining the effect of intramammary infections with minor mastitis pathogens on  the acquisition of new intramammary infections with major mastitis pathogens--a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  == major mastitis pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and the coliforms are usually considered more virulent and damaging to the udder than minor mastitis pathogens  such as corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns). the current literature contains several studies detailing analyses with conflicting results as to whether intramammary infection (imi) with the minor pathogens decreases, increases, or has no effect on the risk of a quarter acquiring a new intramammary infection (nimi) with a major pathogen. to investigate the available scientific evidence regarding the effect of imi with minor pathogens on the acquisition of nimi with major pathogens, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. the total extant english- and french-language literature in electronic databases was searched and all publications cited by relevant papers were investigated. results from 68 studies were extracted from 38 relevant papers. random-effects models were used to investigate the effects of cns and c.  bovis on acquisition of new imi with any of the major pathogens, as well as individually for the minor pathogens and staph. aureus. significant heterogeneity among studies exists, some of which could be accounted for by using meta-regression. overall, observational studies showed no effect, whereas challenge studies showed strong and significant protective effects, specifically  when major pathogens were introduced into the mammary gland via methods bypassing the teat end. underlying risk can account for several unmeasured factors, and studies with higher underlying risk found more protective effects of minor pathogens. larger doses of challenge organisms reduced the protective effect of minor pathogens, and studies with more stringent diagnostic criteria for pathogen imi identified less protection. smaller studies (those utilizing fewer than 40 cows) also showed a greater protective effect than larger studies.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == phenotyping and genotyping of streptococci in bovine milk in argentinean dairy herds.
AB  == most veterinary and milk hygiene laboratories identify streptococci and enterococci based on serological and biochemical tests. the analysis of 16s rdna  was suggested to be used for more exact identification; however, its use has not  been considered so far in monitoring studies. the objective of the present study  was to compare a conventional phenotypic method with restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis of 16s rdna (16s rdna rflp) for identification of streptococci isolated from composite milk samples collected in connection with intramammary infection (imi) in six argentinean dairy farms. composite milk samples (n = 1223) from cows belonging to six herds were collected for bacteriological analysis. twelve reference strains and fifty streptococci or streptococcuslike isolates were identified to species level by the api 20 strep system, conventional biochemical tests and 16s rdna rflp in a blind assay. the remaining streptococci or streptococcus-like isolates (n = 40) were identified to the species level both by 16s rdna rflp and conventional biochemical tests. as indicated by kappa values, agreement between the 16s rdna rflp and the conventional scheme for identification of streptococcus agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, s. uberis, s. equinus and enterococcus faecalis was 0.91, 0.73, 0.92, 0.81 and 0.85, respectively. together with the less frequently isolated streptococcal species, the conventional scheme correctly identified 77 out of 90  isolates (85.5%). thus, the use of 16s rdna rflp is considered valuable for monitoring studies due to its affordable cost for standard laboratories.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in cirrhotic patients: case series and description of the prognostic role of acute renal failure.
AB  == aim: to analyze the mortality risk factors in cirrhotic patients with bacterial meningitis (bm). background: cirrhotic patients are susceptible to infections. despite its high mortality rate, bm has not been extensively studied in this group of patients. study: bm patients diagnosed with cirrhosis, between 1987 and  2008, were studied. bm was defined as the presence of signs or symptoms of meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (csf) leukocyte count >100/mm3 or the presence of bacteria in csf. results: we identified 4955 infections among 7591 cirrhotic patients; 12 (0.2%) had bm. the mean age at diagnosis was 60+/-16 years. abnormal mental status (83%), fever (67%), and neck stiffness (67%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. the sensitivity of csf culture was 75%  (streptococcus pneumoniae, 2; staphylococcus aureus, 2; listeria monocytogenes, 1; group b streptococcus, 1; streptococcus agalactiae, 1; streptococcus bovis, 1; and escherichia coli, 1), and its correlation with blood culture was 78%. five patients died. on admission, the serum creatinine level was 1.63+/-0.93 mg/dl. a  serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dl was associated with increased mortality (p=0.028). the model for end-stage liver disease score, gastrointestinal bleeding, bilirubin level >3.5 mg/dl, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus,  and results of cytology and biochemistry tests of csf were not associated with mortality. conclusions: bm in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high mortality rate. the clinical and microbiologic features of bm in cirrhotic patients differ from those in the general population. a serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dl on admission is associated with a higher risk of mortality.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of streptococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples in korea.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance of streptococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples. a total of 178 isolates  belonging to 6 different streptococcus species were examined: s. uberis (n = 99), s. bovis (n = 30), s. oralis (n = 24), s. salivarius (n = 13), s. intermedius (n  = 7), and s. agalactiae (n = 5). only 8.9% (16/178) of the isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested in this study, and s. agalactiae and s. intermedius isolates were all resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial agent  tested. overall, the most frequently observed resistance was to tetracycline (61.2%), followed by lincomycin (43.2%), gentamycin (35.3%), oxacillin (34.3%), and erythromycin (28.6%). cephalothin and penicillin were the only antimicrobial  agents to which most of the streptococci (>or=92%) were susceptible. wide differences in the prevalence of resistance are apparent among the individual species: s. salivarius displayed exceptionally high resistance to cephalothin (23.0%) and oxacillin (76.9%) and s. agalactiae (20%) and s. intermedius (14.2%)  to penicillin. streptococcus salivarius and s. agalactiae were all susceptible to erythromycin, but others showed various rates of resistance ranging from 12.5% to 42.8%. resistance to 3 or more of 7 antimicrobial agents was observed in all species (37.6%, 67/178).

TI  == pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  == this paper describes a new dna chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly  from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine  mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus canis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus parauberis, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma spp., salmonella spp., bacillus spp., campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli and related species. these groups were identified based on the 16s rrna gene. for microarray validation, 22 strains from the american type culture collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested.  the results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. the universal array  described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.

TI  == cns mastitis: nothing to worry about?
AB  == in this paper, we analyzed a very large field data set on intramammary infections (imi) and the associated somatic cell count (scc) in dairy cows. the objective of the study was to analyze the impact of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) imi on cow scc, both mean and variability, and on the potential of these infections to have a major impact on the bulk milk scc (bmscc). data and milk samples for bacterial culture were collected by quality milk production services (qmps) between 1992 and march of 2007. the qmps program services dairy farms in new york state and other states in the northeastern usa and operates in conjunction with cornell university. only records from cows where scc and milk production data were available, and where only one organism was isolated from bacterial cultures  of milk samples (or where culture was negative) were used for this analysis. a total of 352,614 records from 4200 whole herd mastitis screening sampling qualified for this study. within herds an average of 15% (s.d. 12%) of cows sampled were infected with cns, ranging between 0 and 100%. average within herd prevalence of cows with a cns imi and an scc over 200,000 cells/ml was 2% (s.d. 4%) with a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 50%. results of linear mixed models showed three distinct populations of imi statuses: negative cultures with the lowest scc; cns and corynebacterium bovis with a moderate increase in scc, and streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus aureus showing an important increase in scc. surprisingly, milk production was slightly but significantly higher in cns infected cows compared to culture-negative cows, whereas it was strongly reduced in cows with a major pathogen imi. the percentage contribution of cns infections to the bmscc was 17.9% in herds with a bmscc less  than 200,000 cells/ml. this value decreased to 11.9 and 7.9% in herds with bulk milk scc between 200,000 and 400,000 and over 400,000 cells/ml, respectively. we  concluded that very few herds with milk quality problems would have an important  increase in bmscc that could be mostly attributed to cns infections. on the other hand, in herds with low bmscc, cns infections may be an important contributor to  the total number of somatic cells in the bulk milk.

TI  == use of primers based on the heat shock protein genes hsp70, hsp40, and hsp10, for the detection of bovine mastitis pathogens streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis and streptococcus bovis.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, and streptococcus bovis are three of the major pathogens which cause mastitis in dairy herds. since conventional methods for the detection of these mastitis pathogens are laborious and time-consuming, rapid methods are needed. with an attempt to know if heat shock protein (hsp) genes other than hsp60 gene, could be used for pcr primer designing, in this study, we tried to design pcr primers based on the heat shock  protein genes hsp70, hsp40, and hsp10 for the specific detection of s. agalactiae, s. uberis, and s. bovis, respectively. using these primers, all the randomly selected target strains could be specifically detected. bacterial species other than the target organisms, including strains of other streptococcus spp., and strains of non-streptococcus spp., would not generate any false positive results. as these pcr primers were used for direct detection of mastitis pathogens, the detection limit was n (n=1-9) x 10(3)cfu/ml of cell dilutions. if  a 10h pre-enrichment step was performed, the detection limit was n x 10(0)cfu/ml. thus, these primers could be used for the specific and sensitive detection of bovine mastitis bacteria.

AB  == to efficiently prevent and treat bovine mastitis and minimize its effect on the dairy industry, a sensitive, rapid, and specific test is required for identifying the mastitis-causing pathogens. in this study, a biochip capable of detecting 7 common species of mastitis-causing pathogens, including corynebacterium bovis, mycoplasma bovis, staphylococcus aureus, and the streptococcus spp. s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. dysgalactiae, and s. uberis, within 6 hr was developed.  the technique is based on dna amplification of genes specific to the target pathogens and consists of 4 basic steps: dna extraction of bacteria, polymerase chain reaction, dna hybridization, and colorimetric reaction. to examine the accuracy and specificity of this biochip, a preliminary test with 82 random quarter milk samples were analyzed and compared with results from conventional microbiological methods conducted simultaneously. results from all but 1 sample analyzed by the biochip were in agreement with those analyzed by bacteriology. the biochip could be a feasible tool for rapidly diagnosing mastitis-causing pathogens in milk and providing information for a more effective treatment to cure mastitis.

TI  == streptococcal pd peritonitis--a 10-year review of one centre's experience.
AB  == background: detailed descriptive studies focusing on streptococcal peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis are lacking. most of the current information is available through isolated case reports. methods: we conducted a retrospective analysis of our peritoneal dialysis (pd) peritonitis database over the last decade to study the clinical profile and treatment outcomes of streptococcal peritonitis. results: a total of 68 patients (age: 57.12 +/- 16.6 years; male: 58.7%) with 104 episodes of streptococcal peritonitis (11.7% of total peritonitis) were identified. of the patients, 18 (26.4%) were considered immunocompromised [failed renal transplant, systemic lupus erythematosus (sle)] and 28 (41.1%) had diabetes. streptococcus viridans accounted for the majority (94 episodes: 90.3%) of the streptococcal peritonitis. one patient developed s. viridans peritonitis after dental cleaning without antibiotic prophylaxis. two (1.9%) infections with s. agalactiae and s. bovis each and seven (6.7%) with non-haemolytic streptococcus were noted. three patients had hospital-acquired infection. twenty-six (25%) episodes needed 8 +/- 5.9 days of hospitalization. concurrent infection with two organisms accounted for 17 (16.3%) episodes. cefazolin (71) and vancomycin (29) were the primary antibiotics used for the treatment. five episodes needed two antibiotics and one patient required antifungal treatment. a third of the patients (33.3%) had peritonitis that resolved slowly, although the majority of those (94%) did ultimately resolve with antibiotics alone. five (4.8%) episodes required removal of the pd catheter. three of them were associated with dual infections (one each with yeast, stenotrophomonas and enterococcus). relapse occurred in eight (7.6%) episodes, and 11 (10.5%) recurred over the period from 4 weeks to 6 months after treatment. conclusions: streptococci remain a significant cause of pd peritonitis. viridans  strep is the primary subtype responsible. isolated infections with these organisms are associated with slower response, good outcome and higher rates of recurrence.

TI  == potential pathogens carried by spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern spain.
AB  == the spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. we sampled 321 ibex  (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with sarcoptes scabiei. a total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with s. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. infections with mycoplasma agalactiae and mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. with escherichia coli, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida biotype a, and staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher  isolation rates were associated with adults. the isolation frequency for e. coli  was higher in females, whereas moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated  with males. the presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and m. haemolytica. the geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of branhamella ovis, m. agalactiae, and all pasteurella sp. isolations of m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, e. coli, and b. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging  rather than captive animals. of the gram-positive bacteria, s. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. mycoplasma agalactiae and m. arginini were the predominant mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. the most frequently  isolated gram-negative bacteria included e. coli, m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, and b. ovis. isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. in nasal samples, m. haemolytica and p. multocida biotype a were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, b. ovis and e. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.

TI  == prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens in bulk tank milk in prince edward island.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to 1) estimate the herd prevalence of contagious mastitis pathogens in bulk milk from prince edward island (pei) dairy farms, 2) determine the association between bulk milk culture results and mean bulk milk somatic cell count (bmscc), and 3) investigate the agreement of repeated bulk milk cultures. three consecutive bulk milk samples were obtained at weekly intervals from all 258 pei dairy herds and were cultured using routine laboratory methods. cumulative prevalence of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and mycoplasma spp. (m. bovis and m. alkalescens) was 74%, 1.6%, and  1.9%, respectively. bulk milk somatic cell count of staph. aureus-positive herds  was higher than that of negative herds. agreement for staph. aureus isolation between 3 consecutive tests was moderate (kappa = 0.46). mycoplasma bovis and m.  alkalescens in bulk milk are being reported for the 1st time in pei ever and in canada since 1972.

TI  == prevalence of mastitis pathogens and their resistance against antimicrobial agents in dairy cows in brandenburg, germany.
AB  == the primary objective of this study was to determine management practices concerning mastitis in brandenburg, germany, the prevalence of mastitis pathogens in dairy cows, and their resistance to selected antimicrobial agents. a further objective was to study the potential effect of parity and stage of lactation on the resistance of staphylococcus aureus isolates against ampicillin. milk samples for microbiological culture were collected from 4 groups of clinically healthy cows (first lactation, >1 lactation, >50 d in milk, and >250 d in milk; 8 cows/group) in 80 dairy herds. resistance of gram-positive pathogens against 6 antimicrobial agents was tested using the broth microdilution method. mastitis pathogens were isolated from 26.4% of the milk samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns, 9.1% of quarters) and corynebacterium bovis (7.3%) were the pathogens most frequently isolated. among the major pathogens, staph. aureus (5.7%) and streptococcus uberis (1.0%) had the highest prevalence. streptococcus  agalactiae was isolated in samples from 29% of the herds. although the prevalence of most pathogens was higher in older cows, the prevalence of cns was higher in primiparous cows. results of the mastitis control questionnaire showed that cows  with clinical mastitis were transferred to a sick cow pen in 70% of the herds. cephalosporins were the drug of first choice for treatment of clinical mastitis cases followed by fixed combinations of antimicrobial agents, beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins, and penicillin. most farmers treated cows 3 to 4 times per case. cloxacillin, alone or in combination, and penicillin were most often used for dry-cow therapy. antimicrobial resistance of the pathogens was within the range of other reports. resistance of staph. aureus to ampicillin  increased significantly during the first lactation. further research is required  to determine the factors that lead to the selection of staph. aureus strains that are resistant to ampicillin during the first lactation.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == a comparative field trial of cephalonium and cloxacillin for dry cow therapy for  mastitis in australian dairy cows.
AB  == objective: to investigate and compare the therapeutic efficacy of dry cow agents  containing either cephalonium or cloxacillin within australian dairy herds. design: a treatment-control trial. methods: milk from infected quarters of cows with high somatic cell counts in milk on eight australian dairy farms was cultured to identify bacterial pathogens. cows were randomly assigned to treatment groups and one group was treated with cephalonium at drying off and the other group was treated with cloxacillin at drying off. milk samples from infected quarters were collected immediately after calving and were cultured for  pathogens. the effect of treatment on bacteriological cure was examined and somatic cell counts from infected cows from the first two herd tests after calving were examined for a treatment effect. on four farms, milk samples were collected for culture from all cases of clinical mastitis identified within the first 7 days after calving. the effect of treatment upon incidence of clinical mastitis after calving was examined. results: there was no significant difference between treatments on quarter cure rates for new infections, for chronic infections and for infections with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus uberis. infected quarters treated with cephalonium had a significantly higher cure rate than quarters treated with cloxacillin when  corynebacterium bovis and staphylococcus epidermids were included as pathogens combined (80.3% versus 70.7%). there was no significant difference between the treatments on somatic cell counts of infected cows at the first two herd tests after calving. there was no difference between treatments on the incidence of clinical mastitis in the first 7 days after calving.

TI  == simple and rapid pcr method for identification of streptococcal species relevant  to animal infections based on 23s rdna sequence.
AB  == a pcr identification system targeting 23s rdna sequences for the identification of eight streptococcal species relevant to animal infections (streptococcus agalactiae, s. bovis, s. canis, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. porcinus, s. suis and s. uberis) was developed. this system consists of two pcr reactions, a and b, in which seven and eight primers, respectively, are used simultaneously, and was  designed so that each amplification product indicates a species by its size. a total of 111 cultures, including the type strain of eight species, could be successfully identified and differentiated as individual species, except for the  cross reactivity between s. bovis and s. equinus. the developed pcr system can complete the identification procedure for eight streptococcal species through two tube reactions per isolate, and, therefore, might provide a rapid, simple and accurate diagnostic tool for veterinary laboratories.

TI  == rpob gene sequence-based identification of aerobic gram-positive cocci of the genera streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, abiotrophia, and granulicatella.
AB  == we developed a new molecular tool based on rpob gene (encoding the beta subunit of rna polymerase) sequencing to identify streptococci. we first sequenced the complete rpob gene for streptococcus anginosus, s. equinus, and abiotrophia defectiva. sequences were aligned with these of s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. pneumoniae available in genbank. using an in-house analysis program (svarap),  we identified a 740-bp variable region surrounded by conserved, 20-bp zones and,  by using these conserved zones as pcr primer targets, we amplified and sequenced  this variable region in an additional 30 streptococcus, enterococcus, gemella, granulicatella, and abiotrophia species. this region exhibited 71.2 to 99.3% interspecies homology. we therefore applied our identification system by pcr amplification and sequencing to a collection of 102 streptococci and 60 bacterial isolates belonging to other genera. amplicons were obtained in streptococci and bacillus cereus, and sequencing allowed us to make a correct identification of streptococci. molecular signatures were determined for the discrimination of closely related species within the s. pneumoniae-s. oralis-s. mitis group and the s. agalactiae-s. difficile group. these signatures allowed us to design a s. pneumoniae-specific pcr and sequencing primer pair.

TI  == quarter milk somatic cell count in infected dairy cows: a meta-analysis.
AB  == the aim of this paper was to evaluate the effects associated with intramammary infection (imi) by a bacterium or a group of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, coliforms, staphylococci other than s. aureus, and corynebacterium bovis) on the  somatic cell count (scc) in quarter milk of dairy cows. papers selected for analysis had to provide scc values associated with the natural infection in quarters by different bacteria. sampling for measurement of scc and determination of the infection had to be done on the same day. only papers published in english or in french after 1971 were considered. twenty-one papers fulfilled the selection criteria. the animals sampled, the measurement techniques for scc and the bacteriological identification, as well as the definition of the infection, all differed widely among the selected studies. the meta-analysis method was used to estimate both the mean scc (arithmetic and geometric) value and the average increase on scc of each type of infection. the geometric mean scc in bacteriologically negative quarters was 68 000 c/ml. in case of imi, the retained scc was 357 000, 857 000, 547 000, 1 024 000, 1 151 000, 138 000 and 105 000 c/ml in quarters infected by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, coliforms, staphylococci other  than s. aureus and corynebacterium bovis, respectively. the variation factors that could influence these scc values and the bacteriological results are discussed.

TI  == characterization of the cryptic plasmid psbo2 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid designated psbo2 (3582 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. the psbo2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (cop), countertranscribed rnas (ctrnas),  and a replication protein (rep), which were similar to those from pmv158 and pls1, which were isolated from s. agalactiae, and pwvo1, isolated from lactococcus lactis. the putative single-strand origin (sso) of psbo2 was similar  to per341 and pst1, which were isolated from s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmid designated psbe2 was constructed to bind pecm184 vector and the dna fragment containing sso, dso, cop, ctrnas, and rep of psbo2. when psbe2 was introduced into s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. this plasmid, designated psbe2a, was capable of transforming escherichia coli and s. bovis strains 12-u-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, psbe2a is an effective shuttle vector.

AB  == 1+ were submitted for somatic cell counting (scc), bacteriological examination and to test for antibiotic susceptibility. the scc and germ-cell counts of monthly bulk-tank milk samples were available through dairy inspection and advisory services and milk production data of 567 herd-book cows were available from breeding associations. possible individual and environmental predictors of subclinical mastitis were identified using logistic models adjusted for clustering of the data at herd and cow levels. data were analyzed separately for  cows from 7 to 100 and from 101 to 305 days post partum. prevalences of subclinical mastitis at the quarter level were 21.2% for lactation period 7-100 days and 34.5% for 101-305 days post partum. the geometric mean scc in bulk-tank  milk samples was 85.6x10(3)cells/ml. samples at 7-100 and 101-305 days post partum were positive for staphylococcus aureus in 16.0 and 7.4%, for coagulase-negative staphylococci in 51.5 and 50.6%, for streptococcus agalactiae  in 0.0 and 0.8%, for other streptococci in 19.4 and 15.6%, for e. coli in 1.0 and 0.4%, and for corynebacterium bovis in 25.7 and 45.1%, respectively. risks of subclinical mastitis increased significantly with increasing days post partum and advancing age of cow. cows that were sampled when staying in alpine dairies had considerably higher risks of subclinical mastitis than cows staying in home barns. significantly lower risks of subclinical mastitis were observed in farms where cmt was performed regularly as a control measure. bacteria in milk from cows with mastitis exhibited antibiotic resistance at a comparable frequency as found previously in conventional farms.

TI  == epidemiological typing of bovine streptococci by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was used to investigate the epidemiology  of streptococcal mastitis in dairy cattle. the most prevalent streptococcal species, streptococcus uberis (60-80% of streptococcal isolates), was highly heterogeneous, with different cows only rarely sharing the same pulsotype. s. agalactiae was rarely encountered, however all eight isolates from one farm generated identical pfge profiles, which differed from those of all other isolates examined, confirming cow-to-cow transmission. fifty-two isolates of s. dysgalactiae from 27 cows on 5 farms generated 6 different profiles. however, on  individual farms, only one or two pulsotypes usually predominated. this species is generally regarded as an environmental pathogen but our data suggest that cow-to-cow transmission of s. dysgalactiae may occur. in spite of the variation in pfge profiles of isolates from different cows, persistent infections in individual cows were usually caused by the same pulsotype of s. uberis or s. dysgalactiae.

TI  == streptococcal meningitis in adult patients: current epidemiology and clinical spectrum.
AB  == streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae are a rare cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. we report 29 cases of streptococcal meningitis (1977-1997). the patients comprised 19 men and 10 women, with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 47 +/- 18 years. nine cases were secondary to neurosurgical procedures, seven to brain abscess, five to cerebrospinal fluid pericranial fistula, and three to endocarditis. causative microorganisms included the following: viridans group streptococci, 20 cases; anaerobic streptococci, 3; streptococcus agalactiae, 3; streptococcus bovis, 2; and streptococcus pyogenes,  1. four streptococcus mitis strains showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin (mic, 0.5-2 microg/ml). five patients (17%) died. the infection is increasing in  the hospital setting. streptococci resistant to penicillin should be considered in the empirical treatment of nosocomial meningitis. in cases of community-acquired infection, anaerobic streptococci or streptococci of the streptococcus milleri group should alert the clinician to the presence of an undiagnosed brain abscess, whereas oral streptococci of the viridans group suggest the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial activity of alexomycin (pnu-82, 127), a peptide compound projected for use in animal health.
AB  == alexomycin (pnu-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by streptomyces arginensis. mics against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. alexomycin was active against gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and  coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), as well  as enterococcus species (95 strains; mic90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml), and generally inactive against gram-negative aerobes. alexomycin had more potent activity against streptococcus bovis (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), s. agalactiae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), corynebacterium species (mic90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/ml), and listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). alexomycin activity was limited against bacillus species (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), neisseria  meningiditis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml). this thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/ml) in mueller-hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and  did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to  increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == clinical mastitis in dairy cattle in ontario: frequency of occurrence and bacteriological isolates.
AB  == the objective of this study was to describe the frequency of occurrence of clinical mastitis in dairy herds in ontario. the study group consisted of 65 dairy farms involved in a 2-year observational study, which included recording all clinical mastitis cases and milk sampling of quarters with clinical mastitis. lactational incidence risks of 9.8% for abnormal milk only, 8.2% for abnormal milk with a hard or swollen udder, and 4.4% for abnormal milk plus systemic signs of illness related to mastitis were calculated for 2840 cows and heifers. overall, 19.8% of cows experienced one or more cases of clinical mastitis during  location. teat injuries occurred in 2.1% of lactations. standard bacteriology was performed on pretreatment milk samples from 834 cows with clinical mastitis. the  bacteria isolated were staphylococcus aureus (6.7%), streptococcus agalactiae (0.7%), other streptococcus spp. (14.1%), coliforms (17.2%), gram-positive bacilli (5.5%), corynebacterium bovis (1.7%), and other staphylococcus spp. (28.7%). there was no growth in 17.7% of samples, and 8.3% of samples were contaminated. clinical mastitis is a common disease in dairy cows in ontario; approximately 1 in 5 cow lactations have at lease one episode of clinical mastitis. there is, however, considerable variation in the incidence of clinical  mastitis among farms. the majority of 1st cases of clinical mastitis occur early  in lactation, and the risk of clinical mastitis increases with increasing parity. environmental, contagious, and minor pathogens were all associated with cases of  clinical mastitis.

TI  == estimation of interdependence among quarters of the bovine udder with subclinical mastitis and implications for analysis.
AB  == interdependency among udder quarters with subclinical mastitis was evaluated on 150 farms using a total of 35,828 udder quarters. the occurrence of high somatic  cell count (scc) (> 250,000 cells/ml) in 0, 3, and 4 quarters occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. for all bacterial species, intramammary infection in 0, 2, 3, or 4 quarters of the same cow occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. intramammary infection and high scc were found less often in front quarters than in rear quarters. high scc and intramammary infection occurred more often in right front quarters than in left front quarters. high scc in diagonal quarters occurred at a lower rate than expected. corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus had the highest intraclass correlation within herd. streptococcus uberis had a very low intraclass correlation within herd. the intraclass correlation within cow for the natural logarithm of scc was 0.47. corynebacterium bovis and strep. agalactiae had the highest intraclass correlation within cow, and streptococcus dysgalactiae had the lowest. analytical methods were proposed to manage the problem of interdependence and its effect on the design or evaluation of field studies on subclinical mastitis.

TI  == association between management practices, dairy herd characteristics, and somatic cell count of bulk tank milk.
AB  == objective: to determine whether particular dairy management practices and herd characteristics were associated with somatic cell count (scc) of bulk tank milk.  design: analysis of records. sample population: milk samples collected from 59,435 cows housed in 843 dairy herds between march 1992 and june 1994. procedure: results of bacterial culture of milk samples and data on farm housing, sanitation, milking system, and management were collected. multiple regression analysis was used to determine sources of variation in bulk tank milk scc among herds. results: prevalence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus  mastitis was associated with bulk tank milk scc. in herds free of s agalactiae mastitis, prevalence of s aureus and corynebacterium bovis mastitis were important. for herds without s agalactiae mastitis, use of sawdust bedding was associated with a decrease in scc and a dirty loose housing area was associated with an increase. increased milk production, repeated mastitis control visits, and use of particular predip compounds were significantly associated with reduced scc in all herds, regardless of whether any cows in the herd had s agalactiae mastitis. in herds with s agalactiae mastitis, use of iodine (certain concentrations), chlorhexidine, peroxide, or sodium chlorite-lactic acid as a predip was associated with a decrease in scc. only use of sodium chlorite-lactic  acid predip was significantly associated with a decrease in scc in herds without  s agalactiae mastitis. clinical implications: important factors associated with bulk tank milk scc were prevalence of s agalactiae and s aureus mastitis, careful application of particular predip compounds, avoiding a dirty loose housing area,  and use of a service to regularly monitor prevalence of mastitis in the herd.

TI  == [the isolation of streptococcus morbillorum from vaginal exudates].
AB  == we have tested 195 vaginal secretions sent by gynecology service of this hospital between the years 1988-1990. we achieved positive culture for streptococci in 58  (30%) of these cultures, 26 (44.8%) corresponding to streptococcus morbillorum 9  (15.5%), to gardnerella vaginalis 5 (8.6%), to enterococcus faecalis-durans and to streptococcus agalactiae, 3 (5.1%) to streptococcus mitis and milleri 2 (3.4%), to streptococcus bovis and cremoris, and 1 (1.7%) to streptococcus salivarius, equinus and sanguis ii respectively. we previously found that 52.8% of these patients were positive for vaginal candidiasis. the bacteriological identification done by the api 20 strep system (biomerieux gmbh, nutingen, germany) provides a typical pattern ("good identification") for the streptococcus morbillorum.

TI  == penetration of ceftriaxone into the intervertebral disc.
AB  == concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after  a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. the mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. the mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per  gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. these drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus; for streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired enterobacteriaceae. the average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. the lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

TI  == use of modified rambach agar to differentiate streptococcus uberis from other mastitis streptococci.
AB  == the medium of rambach was modified to permit differentiation of mastitis streptococci. a total of 377 streptococci isolated from bovine imi was used in the study. of the 159 strains identified as streptococcus uberis, 151 strains (94.9%) were beta-galactosidase-positive and yielded blue colonies on modified rambach agar. in comparison, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, enterococcus saccharolyticus, or enterococcus faecalis strains were negative for propylene glycol utilization (red colonies) or beta-galactosidase production; all strains yielded colorless colonies on modified rambach agar. however, 5 of 35 (14.3%) streptococcus equinus strains were also positive for beta-galactosidase. results indicate that modified rambach agar is a convenient medium for the differentiation of the strep. uberis from the other mastitis streptococci. furthermore, modified rambach agar could be easily incorporated as  a screening medium for strep. uberis in mastitis bacteriology laboratories.

AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae growth responses to metabolites of corynebacterium bovis cultured in media containing polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate, monooleate, or trioleate and milk were determined. filter sterilized metabolites of 48-h c. bovis cultures in synthetic  media were added to cultures of staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae. staphylococcus aureus and strep. agalactiae were inoculated into 12-h c. bovis milk cultures. growth responses of staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae were not affected by c. bovis metabolites of synthetic media. staphylococcus aureus growth was inhibited during logarithmic and stationary phases in milk containing mixed cultures of c. bovis compared with growth in pure staph. aureus cultures. streptococcus agalactiae growth curves were similar in pure and c. bovis mixed cultures. fatty acid compositions were not different in sterile milk and milk containing bacterial cultures. growth responses of staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae were not related to concentration of c. bovis metabolites or fatty acid content of media in which c. bovis were cultured.

TI  == growth inhibition of mastitis pathogens by long-chain fatty acids.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, and corynebacterium bovis were tested for sensitivity to long-chain fatty acids predominant in teat canal keratin. antibacterial activity of free fatty acids on  each bacterial species was measured after 12 and 24 h in chemically defined media. polyene c18:2 and c18:3 acids were bactericidal to each species at less than or equal to 10(5) ng/ml-1. the most bacteriostatic saturated fatty acids were c12 and c14. streptococcus agalactiae growth was inhibited more by fatty acids after 24 h than after 12 h. no incubation time effect on growth responses of other species was determined. polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate had a neutralizing effect on the bactericidal activity of polyene acids on c. bovis. corynebacterium bovis were unable to grow in synthetic media containing individual free fatty acids as the sole source of preformed fatty acids. a relationship between bacterial species commonly isolated from bovine teat canals  with resistance to fatty acids predominant in keratin was not evident.

TI  == comparison of the effect of antibiotic dry cow teat canal and intramammary dry cow therapy of dairy cows on the prevalence of teat canal and intramammary infections at calving.
AB  == the specific therapy of bacterial colonization of the teat canals of dried-off dairy cows by means of small amounts (33 mg/0.25 ml and 14 mg/0.1 ml) of a procain benzyl penicillin-dihydrostreptomycin sulphate combination has been investigated. of 36 teat canals treated with 0.25 ml antibiotic preparation each, 24 (66.6%) were infected at the beginning of the dry period, whereas at its termination only 7 (19.4%) showed bacteriologically positive swab cultures. by treating a further 43 quarters with 0.1 ml quantities of an antibiotic preparation each, the prevalence of infection dropped from 32.5% to 14%. untreated controls (20 quarters) showed no significant change. cultures of teat canal swabs were generally twice as sensitive for indicating the presence of bacteria compared to foremilk sample cultures. staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated organism, followed by streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium bovis and staphylococcus epidermidis.

TI  == effects of corynebacterium bovis infection on susceptibility to major mastitis pathogens.
AB  == experimental challenge procedures were used to study infectivity and virulence of corynebacterium bovis. challenge procedures using staphylococcus aureus (newbould 305) and streptococcus agalactiae (mcdonald 44) were used to study effects of corynebacterium bovis infections on superinfection with major pathogens. rate of  infection under experimental challenge conditions was significantly greater with  corynebacterium bovis than previously observed for staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae. principal location of corynebacterium bovis colonization appeared to the teat canal region, although the organism was isolated from 75% of the teat cisterns by puncture technique. quarters with corynebacterium bovis infections were more resistant to infection by staphylococcus aureus than bacteriologically negative quarters. quarters infected with corynebacterium bacterium bovis were approximately 8.5-fold more susceptible to streptococcus agalactiae infection than negative quarters. somatic cell counts were doubled in negative quarters that developed corynebacterium bovis infections; the geometric mean was 2.4 x 10(5).

TI  == in vitro growth of mastitis-associated streptococci in bovine mammary secretions.
AB  == cell-free, fat-free mammary secretions were tested in vitro for ability to support growth of streptococci associated with mastitis. secretions were obtained prior to drying off, during the dry period, at calving, and during lactation from four cow treatment groups. treatment groups were dry cow therapy, dry cow therapy and mammary glands subjected to induced inflammation 7 d post-drying-off, no dry  cow therapy and no induced inflammation, no dry cow therapy but mammary glands subjected to induced inflammation. growth of streptococcus uberis, streptococcus  faecalis, and streptococcus agalactiae in secretions from nonlactating glands was unaffected by induced inflammation. growth of streptococcus bovis was significantly inhibited in secretion obtained 14 d after induced inflammation. dry cow therapy had no effect on streptococcal growth in secretion obtained 7 d after therapy. streptococcal growth was greatest in secretions from involuted glands, and there was little or no evidence for growth inhibitory factors in cell-free, fat-free secretions obtained during the dry period. milk from lactating glands inhibited streptococcal growth, and the inhibitory factor was presumptively identified as lactoperoxidase. apolactoferrin, immunoglobulin, or both had little effect on streptococcal growth.

TI  == molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b  (mls) in streptococci.
AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

TI  == effect of automatic backflushing on number of new intramammary infections, bacteria on teatcup liners, and milk iodine.
AB  == effect of an automatic iodine (15 ppm) backflushing system on incidence of new intramammary infections, teatcup liner bacterial populations, and milk iodine was tested in a herd free of streptococcus agalactiae and with a low prevalence of staphylococcus aureus. in an 11-mo trial, backflushing was applied to teatcups that milked the right half of the udder; the left half served as control. clawpieces were divided into left and right halves with each having a milk outlet. postmilking teat dipping was discontinued. all lactating cows in the university herd were used, averaging 154 with normal attrition and additions of new individuals as they calved. backflushing reduced numbers of staphylococci recovered from liners by 98.5% and gram-negative bacteria by 99.5% as compared with unflushed liners. backflushing significantly reduced new infections caused by corynebacterium bovis. however, there was no effect on incidence of new infections by staphylococci, streptococci, or coliforms. iodine concentrations averaged 243 micrograms per liter in milk from control quarters and 486 micrograms from backflushed udder halves. interior surface cracking was more severe in backflushed teatcup liners than in control liners. these results do not justify the use of backflushing in a herd with low prevalence of contagious pathogens.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  == a medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. mannitol agar supported  growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except corynebacterium pyogenes. color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. most staphylococcus aureus strains and some staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. these yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from  quarters with significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (scc) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. mannitol-negative strains of s epidermidis (those with red  zones) were obtained from quarters with scc similar to those of uninfected quarters. the streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: streptococcus agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, and group g streptococci produced red zones; str uberis, str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. pathogenic streptococci (str agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, str uberis, and group g streptococci) were obtained from quarters with scc significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with scc similar  to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.

AB  == streptococcal isolates from 71 dairy herds considered free of streptococcus agalactiae were compared with isolates from 1 herd used in bovine mastitis research over a 12-year period. the incidence of streptococci was as follows: streptococcus uberis, 56.5%; enterococci, 24.2%; streptococcus dysgalactiae, 9.0%; streptococcus bovis, 5.1%; unclassified streptococci, 3.1%; streptococcus agalactiae, 1.5%; and lancefield group g streptococci, 0.7%. the incidence for these streptococci in the 2 groups was generally the same except for str bovis and unclassified streptococci. a study of cultural responses in numerous mediums  indicated that differentiation of streptococci recovered from the bovine udder may be obtained with esculin broth, camp test, sodium hippurate broth, 0.1% methylene blue milk, inulin, and raffinose broths.

TI  == selective adhesion of microorganisms to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and corynebacterium bovis were examined for their ability to adhere to the ductular epithelial cells of the bovine udder. s. agalactiae and s. aureus adhered readily and in large numbers, whereas the other organisms adhered  poorly or not at all. the organisms showing the ability to adhere are those which frequently cause mastitis. these data suggest that selective adherence to the ductular epithelium may be the first stage in the pathogenesis of streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis.

TI  == meningitis caused by streptococcus in adults.
AB  == meningitis caused by streptococcus is uncommon in adults. otitis media, mastoiditis, sinusitis, or trauma has antedated most cases reported in the past.  data on 10 recent cases suggest changes in the current pathogenesis of streptococcal meningitis in adults and emphasize the importance of accurate streptococcal speciation. endocarditis was present in five cases; trauma played a role in two others. brain abscess, corticosteroids, alcoholic cirrhosis, and peritonitis secondary to chronic peritoneal dialysis were etiologic factors in five patients. otitis media, mastoiditis, and sinusitis were conspicuously absent. streptococcus agalctiae accounted for purulent meningitis in two postmenopausal women. both strains of group b streptococcus were bacitracin-sensitive and were thus mislabeled group a. recognition of streptococcus bovis spared two patients unnecessary aminoglycoside adminstration. nine of the 10 patients survived, including a women with prosthetic mitral valve  endocarditis and a man with a ruptured brain abscess. differentiation of these streptococci from streptococcus pneumoniae was seldon possible on the basis of the spinal fluid gram stain alone.
