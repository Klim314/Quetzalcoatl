anti-infective properties of lactobacillus fermentum against staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
surgical wounds and implant-associated staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are often difficult to treat because of limited susceptibility of several of these strains to conventional antibiotics. as a result, there is a constant need for new alternative drugs. the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of lactobacillus fermentum, a probiotic bacterium, which we have isolated from colonic biopsies. the inhibition of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa growth was evaluated by coincubating with l. fermentum strains. growth inhibition was tested for several of their clinical isolates using agar well diffusion assays. for biofilm assay s. aureus and p. aeruginosa were grown on the glass slides and in 96-well plates in presence of 2.5 mug/ml culture filtrate of l. fermentum. biofilms were photographed using confocal microscope or stained with 0.1% crystal violet. reduction in the cytotoxicity of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa was observed in presence of 2.5 mug/ml l. fermentum-spent media. using in vitroexperiments, we showed that l. fermentum-secreted compound(s) inhibits the growth, cytotoxicity and biofilm formation of several s. aureus and p. aeruginosa strains. compound(s) present in the culture supernatant of l. fermentum may have promising applications in treating hospital-acquired infections.
lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
