TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological profiles of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seropositive brazilians undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy and hiv-seronegative brazilians with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: this study compares the periodontal clinical profile and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seropositive and hiv-seronegative subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 172 subjects were distributed into two hiv-seropositive groups (37 chronic periodontitis [h+cp+] and 35 periodontally healthy [h+cp-] individuals) and two hiv-seronegative groups (49 chronic periodontitis [h-cp+] and 51 periodontally healthy [h-cp-] subjects). subgingival samples were collected from six sites with the deepest probing depth in the periodontitis groups and six random sites in the groups with periodontal health. all hiv-infected patients had undergone highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart)  for at least 2 years. the presence and levels of 33 bacterial species were detected by dna probes and the checkerboard method. kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney tests were used to seek for significant differences among and between groups. results: h-cp+ patients showed significantly more periodontal destruction and inflammation than h+cp+ patients, whereas h+cp- subjects presented a greater percentage of sites with bleeding than h-cp- subjects (p <0.01). patients who were hiv seronegative showed higher prevalence and levels of most bacterial species than hiv seropositive patients. periodontal pathogens including tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas noxia were more frequently detected in h-cp+ subjects compared to h+cp+ and controls. in contrast, enterococcus faecalis and acinetobacter baumannii were more commonly found in hiv-infected than in non-hiv-infected subjects (p <0.05). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens are more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of hiv-seronegative patients with chronic periodontitis, whereas species not usually associated with periodontitis are detected in higher frequency in hiv-seropositive subjects under haart.
