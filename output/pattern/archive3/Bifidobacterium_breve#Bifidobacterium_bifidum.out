in vitro evaluation of bifidobacterium strains of human origin for potential use  in probiotic functional foods.
the present study investigated some in vitro properties for probiotic use of four strains of bifidobacteria isolated from faeces of healthy children (bifidobacterium longum 51a, bifidobacterium breve 1101a, bifidobacterium pseudolongum 1191a and bifidobacterium bifidum 1622a). in vitro tests were carried out to compare growth rate, aerotolerance, antagonistic activity against pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and cell wall hydrophobicity. mean doubling time of b. longum 51a was shorter compared to the other strains. all strains were aerotolerant up to 72 h of exposure to oxygen. in vitro antagonism showed that b. longum 51a and b. pseudolongum 1191a were able to produce inhibitory diffusible compounds against all pathogenic bacteria tested, but not against candida albicans. b. longum 51a was sensitive to all the antimicrobials tested, except neomycin. the hydrophobic property of the cell wall was highest for b. bifidum 1622a. based on these parameters, b. longum 51a showed the best potential for probiotic use among the tested strains, presenting the greatest sensitivity to antimicrobials, the best growth rate and the highest capacity to produce antagonistic substances against various pathogenic microorganisms.
the role of hemagglutination and effect of exopolysaccharide production on bifidobacteria adhesion to caco-2 cells in vitro.
it is believed that an important criterion for a potential probiotic strain is that it is capable of adhering to mucosal surfaces in the human gastrointestinal tract. the purpose of this study was to investigate a possible relationship between exopolysaccharide production and adhesion to caco-2 cells by bifidobacterium breve a28 and bifidobacterium bifidum a10. in a preselection process, the hemagglutination abilities of these bacteria were determined prior to undertaking adhesion studies. b. breve a28, which produces large amounts of eps (97.00 +/- 2.00 mg/l) and has good hemagglutination abilities (+3) was found to adhere strongly to caco-2 cells. under gastrointestinal conditions, the high eps producing- b. breve a28 was found to have better viability and adhesion to caco-2 cells than the low eps producing- b. bifidum a10. also, b. breve a28 was found to be more effective at inhibiting escherichia coli atcc 11229 than b. bifidum a10. this investigation showed that high eps production and adhesion ability may be important in the selection of bifidobacteria as probiotic strains.
establishment and follow-up of bifidobacterial species in the gut of healthy bottle-fed infants of 1-4 months age.
twenty-one healthy bottle-fed infants were screened monthly (1-4 months) for bifidobacteria in their stools. bifidobacteria were detected by culture and isolates specified by pcr. alternatively, direct pcr in undiluted fecal suspensions was carried out for detection of bifidobacteria under the cultural detection level. all infants harbored cultivable bifidobacteria throughout the study period. beerens medium was shown to permit a better recovery of bifidobacteria than mrs and horse blood columbia agar. direct pcr detection proved valuable in detecting species for which no cultural isolate could be recovered since the species were under the cultural detection level. b. bifidum, b. longum-infantis and b. breve were confirmed as dominant and stable species in infant stools while b. adolescentis and b. catenulatum group exhibited unstable colonization profiles. a trend towards b. breve decrease began at month 3 while carriage of the b. catenulatum group and b. adolescentis was rising. this observation warrants further analysis to assess a possible switch occurring at month 3 in bottle-fed infants, between so-called infant and adult bifidobacterial species.
increased resistance of mice to salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection by synbiotic administration of bifidobacteria and transgalactosylated oligosaccharides.
aims: the anti-infectious activity of bifidobacteria in combination with transgalactosylated oligosaccharides (tos) against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt-2 in an opportunistic antibiotic-induced murine infection model in mice was examined. methods and results: b. breve (strain yakult) with natural resistance to streptomycin sulphate (sm, mic: > 4 mg ml(-1)), when given daily at a dose of 108 cfu/mouse orally under sm treatment was constantly excreted at 10(10) cfu g(-1) faeces so long as sm was administered, even at 2 weeks after discontinuing administration of b. breve. explosive intestinal growth and subsequent extra-intestinal translocation of orally infected lt-2 under sm treatment were inhibited by b. breve colonization, and this anti-infectious activity was strengthened by synbiotic administration of tos with b. breve. comparison of anti-salmonella activity among several bifidobacterium strains with natural resistance to sm revealed that strains such as b. bifidum atcc 15696 and b. catenulatum atcc 27539t conferred no activity, even when they reached high population levels similar those of effective strains such as strain yakult and b. pseudocatenulatum dsm 20439. both the increase in the concentration of organic acids and the lowered ph in the intestine due to bifidobacterial colonization correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, the crude cecal extract of b. breve-colonized mice exerted growth-inhibitory activity against lt-2 in vitro, whereas that of the ineffective b. bifidum-colonized cecum showed much lower activity. conclusions: intestinal colonization by bifidobacteria given exogenously together with tos during antibiotic treatment prevents the antibiotic-induced disruption of colonization resistance to oral infection with s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and the metabolic activity needed to produce organic acids and lower the intestinal ph is important in the anti-infectious activity of synbiotics against enteric infection with salmonella. significance and impact of the study: these results indicate that certain bifidobacteria together with prebiotics may be used for the prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections with antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
[the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b. longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.
[the antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
the antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. longum z4, b. breve r2 and b. bifidum g1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. still of all the bifidobacteria under study had different levels of activity. b. adolescentis strain 2 f1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. in contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with b. breve r2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to e. coli. the data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
growth promotion of bifidobacterium species by whey and casein fractions from human and bovine milk.
an in vitro assay was used to study the growth-promotional activity of human milk (hm), cow's milk (cm), and whey and casein fractions of hm and cm for five strains of bifidobacterium species isolated originally from stools of human infants. whey- and casein-predominant cm-based infant formulas were studied as well. when compared on an equivalent protein basis, the growth promotion activity of hm was greater than that of cm for bifidobacterium bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus and bifidobacterium longum but comparable for b. bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium breve. pasteurization of hm and cm resulted in an increase of growth promotion activity for b. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus and b. bifidum, a decrease for b. infantis, and no change for b. longum and b. breve. the growth promotion activity of hm whey was slightly higher than that of hm casein for four strains of bifidobacteria. when cm casein was a substrate, virtually no growth occurred for b. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus, b. bifidum, b. infantis, and b. longum. the growth promotion activity of cm whey, however, was similar to that of hm whey. a similar trend was observed for cm-based infant formula. whey-dominant formulas promoted better growth of b. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus, b. bifidum, and b. infantis than casein-dominant formulas. the data suggest a direct relationship between amount of whey-specific factors and the ability to promote growth of clinically relevant strains of bifidobacterium species by hm, cm, and cm-based infant formulas.
