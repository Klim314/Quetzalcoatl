TI  == identification of aesculin-hydrolyzing streptococci, lactococci, aerococci and enterococci from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows.
AB  == aesculin-hydrolyzing, catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci isolated from subclinical intramammary infections in dairy cows were identified to species level using growth characteristics and biochemical activity. the results indicated that the aesculin-hydrolyzing cocci associated with this type of infection are a very heterogenic group. s. uberis strains, including inulin- or beta-glucuronidase-negative isolates, accounted for only about one-third of the collection, and enterococcus faecalis strains for one-fifth. other species of some importance included (in descending order of isolation frequency) aerococcus  viridans, streptococcus pluranimalium, lactococcus garvieae, streptococcus bovis  and streptococcus gallolyticus.
