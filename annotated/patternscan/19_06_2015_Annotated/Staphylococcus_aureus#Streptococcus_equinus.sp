TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == failure of early diagnosis of infective endocarditis in japan--a retrospective descriptive analysis.
AB  == infective endocarditis (ie) is a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality, and these can be exacerbated by delay in diagnosis. we investigated ie diagnosis in japan with the emphasis on the delay in diagnosis and its cause and  implications. we conducted a retrospective study on 82 definite ie patients at kobe university hospital from april 1, 2008, through march 31, 2013. we reviewed  charts of the patients for data such as causative pathogens, prescription of inappropriate antibiotic use prior to the diagnosis, existence of risk factors of ie, previous doctor's subspecialty, or duration until the diagnosis, with the primary outcome of 180-day mortality. we also qualitatively, as well as quantitatively, analyzed those cases with delay in diagnosis, and hypothesized its causes and implications. eighty-two patients were reviewed for this analysis. the average age was 61 +/- 14.5-year-old. fifty percent of patients had known underlying risk factors for ies, such as prosthetic heart valve (10), valvular heart disease (21), congenital heart disease (3), or cardiomyopathy (2). the median days until the diagnosis was 14 days (range 2 days to 1 year). sixty-five  percent of patients received inappropriate antibiotic before the diagnosis (53).  forty percent of causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus (mssa 20, mrsa 13), 32% were viridans streptococci and streptococcus bovis, 28% were others or unknown (cns 5, corynebacterium 3, cardiobacterium 1, candida 1). subspecialties  such as general internal medicine (15), and orthopedics (13) were associated with delay in diagnosis. ten patients (12%) died during follow up, and 8 of them had been received prior inappropriate antibiotics. significant delay in the diagnosis of ie was observed in japan. inappropriate antibiotics were prescribed frequently and may be associated with poor prognosis. further improvement for earlier diagnosis of ie is needed.

TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == [recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: the bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  == introduction: recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. the causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. patients and  methods: retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. results: case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (mri) after 2 episodes of haemophilus influenzae meningitis. surgical repair after third recurrence. case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by mri with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae. ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. case 3: girl with meningitis due to staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. mri shows occipital dermal sinus  requiring excision. complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. case 4: child with meningitis due to streptococcus bovis at 9 days and enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to citrobacter freundii and e. faecium later on. spinal mri led to the diagnosis of currarino syndrome with csf fistula, which was surgically repaired. the 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. conclusions: in patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. the isolated microorganism should help to locate it. it is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. the definitive treatment is usually surgical.

TI  == cloning, expression, and purification of a new antibacterial substance gene from  larvae of musca domestica (diptera: muscidae).
AB  == musca domestica l. (diptera: muscidae), the housefly, exhibits unique immune defenses and can produce antibacterial substances upon stimulation with bacteria. on the basis of the cdna library constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization method, a 1188-bp antibacterial substance gene, which we named as566, was amplified by rapid amplification of cdna ends from m. domestica larva  stimulated with salmonella pullorum (enterobacteriaceae: salmonella). in this study, the full-length as566 gene was cloned and inserted into a his-tagged escherichia coli (enterobacteriaceae: escherichia) prokaryotic expression system  to enable production of the recombinant protein. the recombinant as566 protein was purified in denatured form from inclusion bodies and renatured to obtain functionally active as566 protein. the bacteriostatic activity of the recombinant purified as566 protein was assessed using the oxford plate assay system and the results indicated that as566 had antibacterial activity against six bacteria, including an e. coli clinical isolate, s. pullorum, streptococcus bovis (streptococcaceae: streptococcus), streptococcus suis, and staphylococcus aureus  (staphylococcaceae: staphylococcus) in vitro. the antibacterial activity of as566 toward gram- bacteria was two times greater than that against gram+ bacteria. the sequencing results and blast analysis showed that the antibacterial substance gene as566 was not homologous to any other antibacterial substance genes in genbank. the antibacterial mechanisms of the newly discovered as566 protein warrant further study.

TI  == a study on the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved  in skin and meibomian gland lesions of demodectic mange in cattle.
AB  == the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected  animals was investigated. demodex bovis and d. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. the mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a)) and opportunistic organisms (proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and moraxella bovis and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes (group a) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent  microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. the "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.

TI  == effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on probability of conception in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis (cm), occurring in different weekly intervals before or after artificial insemination (ai), on the probability of conception in holstein cows.  clinical mastitis occurring in weekly intervals from 6 wk before until 6 wk after ai was modeled. the first 4 ai in a cow's lactation were included. the following  categories of pathogens were studied: streptococcus spp. (comprising streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, and other streptococcus spp.);  staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns); escherichia coli;  klebsiella spp.; cases with cm signs but no bacterial growth (above the level that can be detected from our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); and other pathogens [including citrobacter, yeasts, trueperella pyogenes, gram-negative bacilli (i.e., gram-negative organisms other than e. coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter, and citrobacter), corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium spp., pasteurella, enterococcus, pseudomonas, mycoplasma, prototheca, and others]. other factors included in the model were parity (1, 2, 3, 4 and higher), season of ai (winter, spring, summer, autumn), day in lactation of first ai, farm, and other non-cm diseases (retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum). data from 90,271 ai in 39,361 lactations in 20,328 cows collected from 2003/2004  to 2011 from 5 new york state dairy farms were analyzed in a generalized linear mixed model with a poisson distribution. the largest reductions in probability of conception were associated with cm occurring in the week before ai or in the 2 wk following ai. escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. had the greatest adverse effects on probability of conception. the probability of conception for a cow with any combination of characteristics may be calculated based on the parameter  estimates. these findings may be helpful to farmers in assessing reproduction in  their dairy cows for more effective cow management.

TI  == bovicin hc5 and nisin reduce staphylococcus aureus adhesion to polystyrene and change the hydrophobicity profile and gibbs free energy of adhesion.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen often multidrug-resistant that not only causes a variety of human diseases, but also is able to survive on biotic and abiotic surfaces through biofilm communities. the best way to inhibit  biofilm establishment is to prevent cell adhesion. in the present study, subinhibitory concentrations of the bacteriocins bovicin hc5 and nisin were tested for their capability to interfere with the adhesion of s. aureus to polystyrene. subinhibitory dosages of the bacteriocins reduced cell adhesion and  this occurred probably due to changes in the hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell and polystyrene surfaces. after treatment with bovicin hc5 and nisin, the surfaces became more hydrophilic and the free energy of adhesion (g(adhesion)) between bacteria and the polystyrene surface was unfavorable. the transcriptional level of selected genes was assessed by rt-qpcr approach, revealing that the bacteriocins affected the expression of some important biofilm associated genes (icad, fnba, and clfb) and rnaiii, which is involved in the quorum sensing mechanism. the conditioning of food-contact surfaces with bacteriocins can be an  innovative and powerful strategy to prevent biofilms in the food industry. the results are relevant for food safety as they indicate that bovicin hc5 and nisin  can inhibit bacterial adhesion and consequent biofilm establishment, since cell adhesion precedes biofilm formation.

TI  == comparison of clinical features of left-sided infective endocarditis involving previously normal versus previously abnormal valves.
AB  == native valve infective endocarditis (ie) in patients with normal valves has increased in the last decades. whether patients with normal valves present a similar prognosis to those with pathologic valves is unresolved. our aim is to describe epidemiologic and clinical differences between patients with left-sided  ie and normal valves and those with native pathologic valves. we analyzed 945 consecutive episodes of ie, 435 of which involved left-sided nonprosthetic ie. they were classified into 2 groups: episodes in normal valves (normal group, n=173) and episodes in pathologic valves (abnormal group, n=262). patients in the normal group were younger, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bovis were more frequently isolated, and vegetations were more frequently found. heart failure, septic shock, and the need for surgery or death were more common. multivariate analysis identified the following as factors independently associated with normal valve ie: age<65 years, s bovis, s aureus, heart failure,  and vegetation detection. factors independently associated with in-hospital events included s aureus, periannular complications, heart failure, and septic shock development. in conclusion, compared with patients with abnormal valve ie,  patients with ie on normal valves were younger, had a more virulent microbiological profile, developed heart failure and septic shock more frequently, needed more surgical procedures, and had worse prognosis.

TI  == antimicrobial constituents and synergism effect of the essential oils from cymbopogon citratus and alpinia galanga.
AB  == from the fresh leaf sheathes of lemongrass (cymbopogon citratus) and rhizomes of  galanga (alpinia galanga) light yellow and colorless oils, respectively, were obtained by hydrodistillation and microwave assisted extraction (mae) in yields of 0.24% and 0.03%, and 0.11% and trace (w/w), respectively. by gc/ms analysis, five major constituents were identified in lemongrass oil, e-citral, z-citral, beta-myrcene, selina-6-en-4-ol, and cis-ocimene, and five in galanga oil, 1,8-cineole, phenol 4-(2-propenyl)-acetate, dl-limonene, alpha-pinene, and a-terpineol. three major components of the combined lemongrass and galanga oils (ratio 7:3, 1:1, 3:7) were 1,8-cineole (46.3%, 31.5%, 19.3%), e-citral (12.8%, 22.7%, 32.8%) and z-citral (8.5%, 15.2%, 21.6%). the mics of lemongrass and galanga oils were: against staphylococcus aureus 0.5% and 4%, v/v, against pseudomonas aeruginosa 40% and >40%,v/v, against streptococcus bovis 0.25% and 0.5%, v/v, and against candida albicans 0.25% and 0.5%, v/v. citral (from lemongrass oil) gave greater potentiation than 1,8-cineole (from galanga oil). the combination profiles of galanga oil with lemongrass oil (volume ratios 3:7, 1:1, and 7:3) were tested against the four pathogenic microorganisms. synergistic activity was best noted for only one ratio (volume ratio 3:7) as the sigmafic< 1  against all tested microorganisms. the present investigation provides evidenc that the utilization of two essential oils in combination should be assessed for  synergistic antimicrobial activity in order to reduce their minimum effective dose.

TI  == trends in diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis: a review.
AB  == mastitis (inflammation of mammary gland) is a most devastating disease condition  in terms of economic losses occurring throughout the world. the etiological agents may vary from place to place depending on climate; animal species and animal husbandry and include wide variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria; and fungi. they may be either contagious viz. staphylococcus aureus; streptococcus agalactiae or environmental viz. s. dysgalactiae, s. uberis, corynebacterium bovis and coagulase negative staphylococcus. conventional diagnostic tests viz. california mastitis test (cmt); r-mastitest and mast-o-test methods are applied under field conditions; whereas somatic cell count and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc) are useful for early mastitis detection and detection of sub clinical or chronic mastitis respectively. in vitro culture based diagnosis require further study as they can detect only viable cells. the advent of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technology along with its various versions like multiplex and real time pcr has improved the rapidity and sensitivity of diagnosis. circulating micro rna (mirna) based diagnosis; immune assay and proteomics based detection along with biochips and biosensors prove to  be asset to diagnosticians for advanced diagnosis of this economically important  condition. improvement of milking hygiene; implementation of post-milking teat disinfection; regular control of the milking equipments; implementation of milking order; improvement of bedding material are the general measures to prevent new cases of mastitis. the use of antibiotics (intramammary infusions; bacteriocins) and herbs (terminalia spp.) are important for prophylaxis and therapeutics. vaccines viz. cell based; recombinant (staphylococcal enterotoxin type c mutant) or chimeric (paua); live (s. uberis 0140j stain based) and bacterial surface extract based; dna-based and dna-protein based have greatly aided in management of bovine mastitis. quorum sensing and disease resistant breeding using novel biomarkers viz. toll like receptors (tlr) 2 and 4, interleukin (il) 8; breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (brca1) and calcium channel voltage-dependent alpha 2/delta sub unit 1 (cacna2d1) are also indispensable. this mini review gives an overview of all these different aspects  that act as trend setters as far as the diagnosis and control of bovine mastitis  is concerned to help the diagnosticians; epidemiologists and researchers not to remain ignorant about this grave condition.

TI  == cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies using quantitative real-time pcr and  bacterial culture to identify contagious mastitis cases in large dairy herds.
AB  == diagnostic strategies to detect contagious mastitis caused by mycoplasma bovis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae in dairy herds during an outbreak have been minimally studied with regard to cost and diagnostic sensitivity. the objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for identification of infected cows in two california dairy herds during contagious mastitis outbreaks. m. bovis was  investigated in a subset of a herd (n=1210 cows) with an estimated prevalence of  2.8% (95% ci=1.9, 3.7), whereas staph. aureus and strep. agalactiae were studied  in a second herd (n=351 cows) with an estimated prevalence of 3.4% (95% ci=1.5, 5.3) and 16.8% (95% ci=12.9, 20.7), respectively. diagnostic strategies involved  a combination of testing stages that utilized bacterial culture, quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr), or both. strategies were applied to individual or pooled samples of 5, 10, 50 or 100 samples. culture was considered the gold standard for sensitivity estimation of each strategy. the reference strategy was the strategy  with the lowest cost per culture-positive cow which for both m. bovis and strep.  agalactiae consisted of 2 stages, culture of samples in pools of 5 followed by culture of individual samples in positive pools with a sensitivity of 73.5% (95%  ci: 55.6, 87.1) and 96.6% (95% ci: 27.7, 84.8), respectively. the reference strategy for staph. aureus consisted of 3 stages, culture of individual samples in pools of 100 (stage 1), culture constituents of those positive from stage 1 in pools of 5 (stage 2), culture constituents of those positive from stage 2 individually (stage 3) which resulted in a sensitivity of 58.3% (95% ci: 88.3, 99.6). the most cost-effective alternative to the reference strategy was whole herd milk culture for all 3 pathogens. qpcr testing was a component of the second most cost-effective alternative for m. bovis and the third most cost-effective alternatives for the 3 pathogens. a stochastic model was used to assess the effect of prevalence or herd size on the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies. in the current study, increasing the prevalence of mastitis did not alter the ranking of strategies by cost-effectiveness. however, larger herds could benefit from testing larger pools such as 50 or 100 samples to improve cost-effectiveness. several diagnostic strategy options exist to identify contagious mastitis in herds, decisions should be based on cost and sensitivity of the strategies available.

TI  == pathogen-specific effects on milk yield in repeated clinical mastitis episodes in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (cm) cases due to different pathogens on milk yield in holstein cows. the first 3 cm cases in a cow's lactation were modeled. eight categories of pathogens were included: streptococcus spp.; staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns); escherichia coli; klebsiella spp.; cases with cm signs but no bacterial growth (above the level detectable by our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample, and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); other pathogens that may be treated with antibiotics (included citrobacter, corynebacterium bovis, enterobacter, enterococcus, pasteurella, pseudomonas; "other treatable"); and other pathogens not successfully treated with antibiotics (trueperella pyogenes, mycoplasma, prototheca, yeasts; "other not treatable"). data from 38,276 lactations in cows from 5 new york state dairy herds, collected from 2003-2004 until 2011, were analyzed. mixed models with an autoregressive correlation structure (to account for correlation among the repeated measures of milk yield within a lactation) were estimated. primiparous (lactation 1) and multiparous (lactations 2 and 3) cows were analyzed separately, as the shapes of their lactation curves differed.  primiparas were followed for up to 48 wk of lactation and multiparas for up to 44 wk. fixed effects included parity, calving season, week of lactation, cm (type, case number, and timing of cm in relation to milk production cycle), and other diseases (milk fever, retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum).  herd was modeled as a random effect. clinical mastitis was more common in multiparas than in primiparas. in primiparas, streptococcus spp. occurred most frequently as the first case. in multiparas, e. coli was most common as the first case. in subsequent cases, cm cases with no specific growth or contamination were most common in both parity groups. the hazard of cm increased with case number. mastitic cows were generally higher producers before the cm episode than their nonmastitic herdmates. milk loss varied with pathogen and case number. in primiparas, the greatest losses were associated with e. coli and "other not treatable" organisms. in multiparas, the greatest losses were associated with klebsiella spp. and "other not treatable" organisms. milk loss was not associated with occurrence of cns. the findings may help farmers to make optimal management  decisions for their cows.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == systemic prepartum treatment of end-term dairy heifers with penethamate hydriodide: effect on udder health, milk yield, and culling until 120 days in milk.
AB  == prepartum intramammary treatment with antimicrobials of end-term dairy heifers has frequently been proposed as a practice to reduce the prevalence of intramammary infections (imi) at calving. from a safety standpoint for both animal and administrator, systemic treatment is preferred. a clinical trial was conducted on heifers from 10 well-managed, commercial dairy farms with a low prevalence of heifer mastitis. the aim was to assess both the short- and long-term effects of a systemic prepartum therapy with penethamate hydriodide on  udder health and milk production. because it was hypothesized that some herds would benefit more from this treatment than others, specific herd-level information was collected before the start of the actual trial to screen for and  explain potential herd-specific treatment effects. further, the effect of treatment on antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococcal isolates was monitored. end-term heifers were either treated systemically (over 3 consecutive  days) 2 wk before expected calving date with penethamate hydriodide (n=76) or remained untreated (n=73). systemic prepartum treatment of end-term heifers with  penethamate hydriodide resulted in fewer imi in early lactation. however, all 6 cases of clinical mastitis in early lactation occurred in the treatment group [streptococcus uberis (n=1), corynebacterium bovis (n=1), staphylococcus aureus (n=1); 1 sample was contaminated; 2 samples remained culture negative]. no long-term treatment effects (from 4 to 120 d in milk) on milk production, udder health, or culling hazard during later lactation were detected, although treated  heifers belonging to herds classified as having low-yielding heifers out-produced the control heifers. moreover, penicillin susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from milk samples of treated or control heifers did not differ. herds with a low prevalence of heifer mastitis are not likely to benefit from prepartum systemic antimicrobial treatment of the end-term heifers.

TI  == rapid mastitis detection assay on porous nitrocellulose membrane slides.
AB  == we have developed a rapid mastitis detection test based on the immobilization of  tag-specific antibody molecules, the binding of double-tagged amplicons, and as a secondary signal a conjugate of black carbon nanoparticles having molecules of a  fusion protein of neutravidin and alkaline phosphatase at their surface. the antibodies were inkjet printed onto three different nitrocellulose membrane slides, unisart (sartorius), fast (ge whatman), and oncyte-avid (grace-biolabs),  and the final assay signals on these slides were compared. the blackness of the spots was determined by flatbed scanning and assessment of the pixel gray volume  using totallab image analysis software. the black spots could be easily read by the naked eye. we successfully demonstrated the detection of specific amplicons from mastitis-causing pathogens in less than 3 h. using a similar protocol, we also showed that it was possible to detect specific amplicons from four different mastitis-causing pathogens (six strains) on the same pad. the influence of two different printing buffers, phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.4) and carbonate buffer (ph 9.6), on the functionality of the primary antibodies was also compared.

TI  == molecular characterization of alpha-amylase from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is one of the prominent gram positive human pathogen secretes many surface and secretary proteins including various enzymes and pathogenic factors that favour the successful colonization and infection of host  tissue. alpha-amylase is one of the enzymes secreted by s. aureus which catalyses the breakdown of complex sugars to monosaccharides, which are required for colonization and survival of this pathogen in any anatomical locales. in the present study we have cloned, sequenced, expressed and characterized alpha-amylase gene from s. aureus atcc12600. the recombinant enzyme has a molecular weight of 58kda and the kinetics showed vmax 0.0208+/-0.033 (mg/ml)/mg/min and km 10.633+/-0.737mg/ml. the multiple sequence analysis showed  alpha- amylase of s. aureus exhibited large differences with bacillus subtilis and streptococcus bovis. as the crystal structure of s. aureus alpha- amylase was unavailable, we used homology modelling method to build the structure. the built  structure was validated by ramachandran plot which showed 90% of the residues in  the allowed region while no residue was found in the disallowed region and the built structure was close to the crystal structure with z-score: -6.85. the structural superimposition studies with alpha- amylases of bacillus subtilis and  streptococcus bovis showed distinct differences with rmsd values of 18.158aand 7.091a respectively which correlated with enzyme kinetics, indicating alpha-amylase is different among these bacteria.

TI  == effect on quarter milk somatic cell count and antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococcus rostri causing intramammary infection in dairy water buffaloes.
AB  == in many parts of the world, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) are the predominant cause of intramammary infections (imi) in dairy cows and in water buffaloes, as well. a longitudinal field study was carried out on one well-managed dairy water buffalo herd to determine the prevalence and distribution of cns and a recently described cns-species, staphylococcus rostri,  in milk samples to explore its relevance for buffaloes' udder health throughout lactation, and to gain insight into the susceptibility of the latter species toward commonly used antimicrobials. twice weekly quarter milk samples from a cohort of 11 lactating water buffaloes were collected over an 8-mo period. the cns (n=109; 76.2% of all culture-positive samples) were the predominant pathogens causing imi, followed by corynebacterium bovis (n=11; 7.6%) and streptococcus spp. (n=9; 6.2%) other than stretococcus uberis (n=2; 1.4%). thirty-seven hemolytic staphylococci suspected to be staphylococcus aureus were further differentiated using transfer dna-intergenic spacer-pcr and rpob-gene sequencing  because they were coagulase-negative. thirty-three of those isolates were identified as staph. rostri, whereas 2 others were identified as staphylococcus epidermidis. none of the staph. rostri isolates displayed resistance to the antimicrobial agents tested. mean quarter milk somatic cell count (qscc) of all samples collected throughout lactation was 20,970 cells/ml. the qscc at sampling  of quarters infected with staph. rostri (34,466 cells/ml) and cns other than staph. rostri (34,813 cells/ml) were significantly higher than the qscc of noninfected quarters (20,287 cells/ml), yet not significantly different from each other. these findings provide novel insight into the prevalence and distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility, and relevance of staph. rostri compared with other  cns species causing imi in water buffaloes. further studies are needed to pinpoint the relevance, niches, and transmission routes of staph. rostri, as well as other cns in water buffaloes.

TI  == milk haptoglobin, milk amyloid a, and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity in bovines with naturally occurring clinical mastitis diagnosed with a quantitative  pcr test.
AB  == the associations between quantitative bacteriological results from a real-time pcr test and concentrations of acute-phase proteins (app) and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) activity in milk in naturally occurring  clinical mastitis were investigated. milk app concentrations and nagase activity  in clinical mastitis caused by different udder pathogens were studied. the associations between the severity of the clinical signs and concentrations of app and nagase activity were estimated. milk samples from 281 cases of clinical mastitis were collected from 3 estonian dairy farms and analyzed by pcr to identify pathogens. twenty-seven samples out of 281 (9.6%) were pcr negative. milk samples containing 4 or more bacterial species (n=28) were considered possibly contaminated and excluded from all further analyses. in total, 443 bacterial identifications were made from the remaining 226 milk samples. a single bacterial species was detected in 68 samples (30.1%), 2 species were detected in  99 samples (43.8%), and 3 species were detected in 59 (26.1%) samples. to determine the inflammatory response in the udder, the concentrations of milk amyloid a (maa) and haptoglobin (hp) and nagase activity in the milk were analyzed. a significant positive association was found between the severity of the clinical signs and inflammatory markers in the milk. milk amyloid a and hp concentrations and nagase activity were significantly higher in samples with large quantities of bacterial dna from escherichia coli or streptococcus dysgalactiae compared with milk samples not containing those species. large quantities of bacterial dna from trueperella pyogenes or streptococcus uberis in  the milk were associated with elevated concentrations of hp and high nagase activity, but not with increased maa concentrations. milk samples containing corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci had significantly lower concentrations of maa and hp and lower nagase activity compared with samples where these species were not detected. it can be concluded that concentrations of app and nagase activity in the milk were associated with the quantity of bacterial dna in the milk samples.

TI  == relationship between concentration of lingual antimicrobial peptide and somatic cell count in milk of dairy cows.
AB  == lingual antimicrobial peptide (lap) belongs to the beta-defensin family in cattle and is found in milk. lap concentrations increase in milk from mastitic udders; however, the relationship between lap concentrations and the somatic cell count (scc) in milk remains to be elucidated in detail. therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between lap concentrations and the scc in bovine milk to assess whether lap may be used as an indicator of scc. milk was collected from 66 udders showing various sccs. the scc and lap concentrations were measured in the milk. a significantly higher lap concentration was observed  in milk having 500-5000 x 10(3)cells/ml and >5000 x 10(3)cells/ml scc groups than in lower scc groups (<50 x 10(3)cells/ml and 50-500 x 10(3)cells/ml). a significantly positive correlation between lap concentrations and sccs in milk was observed (r=0.68). in milk samples with >26 nm of lap, 92.0% of milk samples  had high sccs (>200 x 10(3)cells/ml). the concentration of lap in milk infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and  escherichia coli was significantly higher than that in uninfected milk. these results suggest that the concentration of lap can be a useful indicator of the scc in dairy cows.

TI  == mastitis diagnosis in dairy cows using pathoproof real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in comparison with conventional bacterial culture in a northern german field study.
AB  == in the following field study, the commercial pathoproof mastitis pcr assay, a real-time pcr for identifying eleven mastitis pathogens and the staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene, was compared with conventional bacterial culture. for this purpose, 681 udder quarter samples from 173 clinically healthy cows with varying  somatic cell count from four dairy herds in the region of osnabruck, lower saxony, germany, were collected between july 2010 and february 2011 and subjected to pcr and bacterial culture. the frequency of positive pathogen signals was markedly higher with pcr compared with culture (70.6% vs. 32.2%). this was accompanied by a substantial higher percentage of multiple pathogen identifications and a lower percentage of single identifications in the pcr compared with bacterial culture. using bacterial culture as gold standard, moderate to high sensitivities (76.9-100%) and specificities (63.3-98.7%) were calculated for six out of seven pathogens with sufficient detection numbers. for  enterococcus spp, the sensitivity was only 9.1%. when the pcr results of pooled udder quarter samples of the 173 cows were compared with the single udder quarter samples, in 72% of the cases, major pathogen dna was either not found in both types of samples, or in the case of a positive pool sample, the respective pathogens were found in at least one udder quarter sample. with both methods, the most frequently detected mastitis pathogens were coryneform bacteria (pcr: corynebacterium bovis), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and staphylococcus (s.) aureus, followed by arcanobacterium pyogenes/peptoniphilus indolicus with pcr, and then with both methods, streptococcus uberis. the staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene was found in 27.7% of the s. aureus and in 37.0% of the cns identifications.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == lipopeptide biosurfactants from paenibacillus polymyxa inhibit single and mixed species biofilms.
AB  == although biofilms are recognised as important in microbial colonisation, solutions to their inhibition are predominantly based on planktonic assays. these solutions have limited efficacy against biofilms. here, a series of biofilm-orientated tests were used to identify anti-biofilm compounds from marine micro-flora. this led to the isolation of a complex of anti-biofilm compounds from an extract of paenibacillus polymyxa (ppe). a combination of rphplc and mass spectrometry identified the principle components of ppe as fusaricidin b (li-fo4b) and polymyxin d1, with minor contributions from surfactins. this complex (ppe) reduced the biofilm biomass of bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bovis. in contrast, ampicillin was only effective against s. aureus. ppe also inhibited a self-assembling marine biofilm (samb) in co-incubation assays by 99.3% +/- 1.9 and disrupted established samb by 72.4% +/- 4.4, while ampicillin showed no significant reduction. the effectiveness of this complex of lipopeptides against  single and multispecies biofilms suggests a future role in biofilm prevention strategies.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of an acquired subgroup b3 metallo-beta-lactamase gene, blaaim-1, and its unique genetic context in pseudomonas aeruginosa from australia.
AB  == three clinical pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (wch2677, wch2813, and wch2837) isolated from the women's and children's hospital, adelaide, australia, produced  a metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-positive etest result. all isolates were pcr negative for known mbl genes. a gene bank was created, and an mbl gene, designated bla(aim-1), was cloned and fully characterized. the encoded enzyme, aim-1, is a group b3 mbl that has the highest level of identity to thin-b and l1. it is chromosomal and flanked by two copies (one intact and one truncated) of an  iscr element, iscr15. southern hybridization studies indicated the movement of both iscr15 and bla(aim-1) within the three different clinical isolates. aim-1 hydrolyzes most beta-lactams, with the exception of aztreonam and, to a lesser extent, ceftazidime; however, it possesses significantly higher k(cat) values for cefepime and carbapenems than most other mbls. aim-1 was the first mobile group b3 enzyme detected and signals further problems for already beleaguered antimicrobial regimes to treat serious p. aeruginosa and other gram-negative infections.

TI  == examining the effect of intramammary infections with minor mastitis pathogens on  the acquisition of new intramammary infections with major mastitis pathogens--a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  == major mastitis pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and the coliforms are usually considered more virulent and damaging to the udder than minor mastitis pathogens  such as corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns). the current literature contains several studies detailing analyses with conflicting results as to whether intramammary infection (imi) with the minor pathogens decreases, increases, or has no effect on the risk of a quarter acquiring a new intramammary infection (nimi) with a major pathogen. to investigate the available scientific evidence regarding the effect of imi with minor pathogens on the acquisition of nimi with major pathogens, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. the total extant english- and french-language literature in electronic databases was searched and all publications cited by relevant papers were investigated. results from 68 studies were extracted from 38 relevant papers. random-effects models were used to investigate the effects of cns and c.  bovis on acquisition of new imi with any of the major pathogens, as well as individually for the minor pathogens and staph. aureus. significant heterogeneity among studies exists, some of which could be accounted for by using meta-regression. overall, observational studies showed no effect, whereas challenge studies showed strong and significant protective effects, specifically  when major pathogens were introduced into the mammary gland via methods bypassing the teat end. underlying risk can account for several unmeasured factors, and studies with higher underlying risk found more protective effects of minor pathogens. larger doses of challenge organisms reduced the protective effect of minor pathogens, and studies with more stringent diagnostic criteria for pathogen imi identified less protection. smaller studies (those utilizing fewer than 40 cows) also showed a greater protective effect than larger studies.

TI  == investigating clustering in interval-censored udder quarter infection times in dairy cows using a gamma frailty model.
AB  == udder infections in dairy cows are observed at udder quarter level. therefore, the best strategy to study infection dynamics of particular bacteria causing mastitis is to follow up and model individual udder quarter infection times. udder quarter infection times, however, are not independent as they are clustered within a cow and herds. another challenge in modelling infection times is that the exact infection time is unknown; it is only known that the infection has taken place in the interval between the last negative and the first positive sample. we applied a technique based on the gamma frailty model which handles the clustering and interval censoring simultaneously. parameter estimates can be obtained analytically and their variance is obtained by the inverse of the hessian matrix. the proposed technique was applied to udder quarter infection times for corynebacterium bovis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus uberis.  multiparous cows were more likely to get infected earlier in lactation with c. bovis or s. uberis than primiparous cows. the times to infection of all three bacteria were highly clustered at cow level and the results of a stratified model on a subset of herds suggested a high clustering on herd level for c. bovis and s. uberis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in europe.
AB  == a monitoring programme conducted in europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (brd) cases between 2002 and 2008. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. for respiratory pathogens, pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (mic</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of m haemolytica strains were resistant (mic>/=4  microg/ml). histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). mycoplasma bovis mic (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. for mastitis pathogens, the majority of escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568  and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with mic centred on 0.25 microg/ml.  streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with mic centred on 1 microg/ml. marbofloxacin mic for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published mic results.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

AB  == up to half of quarter milk samples submitted for mastitis diagnosis are culture-negative results or lead to identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacterium bovis in conventional culturing, the so-called minor pathogens. the interpretation and usefulness of these results in terms of udder and animal health management is limited, even though the amount of resources spent is relatively high. this work aimed to test two methods of analysis of milk samples with the goal of increasing detection of intramammary pathogens. in the first study, 783 milk samples were processed in duplicate: before and after freezing at -20 degrees c for 24 h, using standard bacteriological techniques. there was a significant difference between the two methods with samples frozen for 24 h yielding significantly fewer gram-positive catalase-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive bacilli and significantly more samples leading to no growth, than samples before freezing. the number of samples yielding gram-positive catalase-negative cocci was not significantly affected by freezing. in the second study, a real-time pcr-based test was performed on milk samples with an individual quarter somatic cell count  above 500,000 cells/ml that were either negative (n=51 samples) or that led to the isolation of minor pathogens in culturing: corynebacterium bovis (n=79 samples) or non-aureus staphylococci (nas, n=32). a mastitis pathogen, beyond the result obtained with standard bacteriology, was detected on 47% of the no-growth  samples, on 35% of the samples from which c. bovis had been isolated and on 25% of the samples from which nas had been isolated. the most commonly detected major pathogen was escherichia coli, followed by streptococcus uberis, arcanobacterium  pyogenes/peptoniphilus indolicus and streptococcus dysgalactiae. these results suggest that simply freezing milk samples for 24 h does not increase the detection of intramammary bacteria in milk samples and therefore should not be recommended. however, use of the real-time pcr-based test may be useful in diagnosing intramammary infections when milk samples with high somatic cell counts are culture-negative or when culturing results in the detection of minor pathogens.

TI  == bacterial meningitis in cirrhotic patients: case series and description of the prognostic role of acute renal failure.
AB  == aim: to analyze the mortality risk factors in cirrhotic patients with bacterial meningitis (bm). background: cirrhotic patients are susceptible to infections. despite its high mortality rate, bm has not been extensively studied in this group of patients. study: bm patients diagnosed with cirrhosis, between 1987 and  2008, were studied. bm was defined as the presence of signs or symptoms of meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (csf) leukocyte count >100/mm3 or the presence of bacteria in csf. results: we identified 4955 infections among 7591 cirrhotic patients; 12 (0.2%) had bm. the mean age at diagnosis was 60+/-16 years. abnormal mental status (83%), fever (67%), and neck stiffness (67%) were the most frequent clinical presentations. the sensitivity of csf culture was 75%  (streptococcus pneumoniae, 2; staphylococcus aureus, 2; listeria monocytogenes, 1; group b streptococcus, 1; streptococcus agalactiae, 1; streptococcus bovis, 1; and escherichia coli, 1), and its correlation with blood culture was 78%. five patients died. on admission, the serum creatinine level was 1.63+/-0.93 mg/dl. a  serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dl was associated with increased mortality (p=0.028). the model for end-stage liver disease score, gastrointestinal bleeding, bilirubin level >3.5 mg/dl, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus,  and results of cytology and biochemistry tests of csf were not associated with mortality. conclusions: bm in cirrhotic patients is associated with a high mortality rate. the clinical and microbiologic features of bm in cirrhotic patients differ from those in the general population. a serum creatinine level >/=1.3 mg/dl on admission is associated with a higher risk of mortality.

TI  == age-dependent profile of left-sided infective endocarditis: a 3-center experience.
AB  == background: the influence of age on the main epidemiological, clinical, echocardiographic, microbiological, and prognostic features of patients with infective endocarditis remains unknown. we present the series with the largest numbers and range of ages of subjects to date that analyzes the influence of age  on the main characteristics of patients with isolated left-sided infective endocarditis. furthermore, this series is the first one in which patients have been distributed according to age quartile. methods and results: a total of 600 episodes of left-sided endocarditis consecutively diagnosed in 3 tertiary centers were stratified into age-specific quartiles and 107 variables compared between the different groups. with increasing age, the percentage of women, previous heart disease, predisposing disease (diabetes mellitus and cancer), and infection by enterococci and streptococcus bovis also increased. valvular insufficiency and perforation and staphylococcus aureus infection were more common in younger patients. the therapeutic approach differed depending on patient age because of the growing proportion of older patients who only received medical treatment. clinical course and hospital prognosis were worse in the older patients because of increased surgical mortality among them. conclusions: increasing age is associated with less valvular impairment (insufficiency and perforation), a more  favorable microbiological profile, and increased surgical mortality among adults  with left-sided infective endocarditis.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

TI  == [novel clinical and epidemiologic trends in elderly infective endocarditis].
AB  == the age of peak incidence of infective endocarditis (ie) has shifted from 45 years in the 50's to 70 years at the present time. elderly persons carry a five times higher risk of ie than the general adult population. factors accounting for this phenomenon include increased use of invasive procedures and implanted medical devices as well as a higher prevalence of degenerative valve disease. in  the elderly, ie onset may be insidious, often masked by one or more underlying conditions such as cancer, diabetes and chronic organ failure, hence the diagnosis may be delayed. the leading pathogen is staphylococcus aureus, more frequently methicillin-resistant, although streptococcus bovis and enterococci are gaining prevalence. vascular phenomena and embolic events are less common in  the elderly, probably due to a lessened acute phase response and a larger use of  antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs. because of diminished renal clearance, antibiotics should be carefully titrated in aged ie patients. cardiac surgery is  performed less often in elderly ie due to poor preoperative conditions. indeed, both these factors may account for the higher mortality rate, that is twice that  of younger ie patients. notwithstanding, age > or = 65 years has been found to be an independent predictor of mortality. prophylactic measures residing mostly on the prevention of health-care associated acquisition need to be more widely implemented in this growing subgroup of ie patients.

TI  == pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  == this paper describes a new dna chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly  from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine  mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus canis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus parauberis, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma spp., salmonella spp., bacillus spp., campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli and related species. these groups were identified based on the 16s rrna gene. for microarray validation, 22 strains from the american type culture collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested.  the results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. the universal array  described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction-based identification of bacteria in milk samples from bovine clinical mastitis with no growth in conventional culturing.
AB  == in more than 30% of milk samples from clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis, bacteria fail to grow even after 48 h of conventional culture. the "no-growth" samples are problematic for mastitis laboratories, veterinarians, and dairy producers. this study provides the first investigation of the bacteriological etiology of such samples, using a real-time pcr-based commercial reagent kit. the assay targets the dna of the 11 most common bacterial species or groups in mastitis and the staphylococcal blaz gene (responsible for penicillin resistance) and can identify and quantify bacterial cells even if dead or growth-inhibited. a study was made of 79 mastitic milk samples with no-growth bacteria in conventional culture, originating from cows with clinical mastitis. of the 79 samples, 34 (43%) were positive for 1 (32 samples) or 2 (2 samples) of the target bacteria. the positive findings included 11 staphylococcus spp. (staphylococci other than staphylococcus aureus), 10 streptococcus uberis, 2 streptococcus dysgalactiae, 6 corynebacterium bovis, 3 staph. aureus, 1 escherichia coli, 1 enterococcus, and 1 arcanobacterium pyogenes. the positive samples contained as many as 10(3) to 10(7) bacterial genome copies per milliliter of milk. this study demonstrates that in nearly half of the clinical mastitis cases in which conventional culture failed to detect bacteria, mastitis pathogens were still present, often in substantial quantities. the clearly elevated n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity values of the milk samples, together with clinical signs of the infected cows and quarters, confirmed the diagnosis of clinical mastitis and indicated that real-time, pcr-based bacterial findings are  able to reveal bacteriological etiology. we conclude that all common mastitis bacteria can occur in large quantities in clinical mastitis samples that exhibit  no growth in conventional culture, and that the real-time pcr assay is a useful tool for bacteriological diagnosis of such milk samples. low bacterial concentration is commonly speculated to explain the no-growth milk samples. this  hypothesis is not supported by the results of the current study.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (mdr) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  == antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (mdr) strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans. atcc strains of streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus bovis, pseudimonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans were also tested. the strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. the mdr strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of acacia nilotica,  syzygium aromaticum and cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of terminalia arjuna and eucalyptus globulus. community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. the most potent antimicrobial plant was a. nilotica (mic range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher mic values than a. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. this study concludes  that a. nilotica, c. zeylanicum and s. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.

TI  == current features of infective endocarditis in elderly patients: results of the international collaboration on endocarditis prospective cohort study.
AB  == background: elderly patients are emerging as a population at high risk for infective endocarditis (ie). however, adequately sized prospective studies on the features of ie in elderly patients are lacking. methods: in this multinational, prospective, observational cohort study within the international collaboration on endocarditis, 2759 consecutive patients were enrolled from june 15, 2000, to december 1, 2005; 1056 patients with ie 65 years or older were compared with 1703 patients younger than 65 years. risk factors, predisposing conditions, origin, clinical features, course, and outcome of ie were comprehensively analyzed. results: elderly patients reported more frequently a hospitalization or an invasive procedure before ie onset. diabetes mellitus and genitourinary and gastrointestinal cancer were the major predisposing conditions. blood culture yield was higher among elderly patients with ie. the leading causative organism was staphylococcus aureus, with a higher rate of methicillin resistance. streptococcus bovis and enterococci were also significantly more prevalent. the clinical presentation of elderly patients with ie was remarkable for lower rates  of embolism, immune-mediated phenomena, or septic complications. at both echocardiography and surgery, fewer vegetations and more abscesses were found, and the gain in the diagnostic yield of transesophageal echocardiography was significantly larger. significantly fewer elderly patients underwent cardiac surgery (38.9% vs 53.5%; p < .001). elderly patients with ie showed a higher rate of in-hospital death (24.9% vs 12.8%; p < .001), and age older than 65 years was  an independent predictor of mortality. conclusions: in this large prospective study, increasing age emerges as a major determinant of the clinical characteristics of ie. lower rates of surgical treatment and high mortality are the most prominent features of elderly patients with ie. efforts should be made to prevent health care-associated acquisition and improve outcomes in this major  subgroup of patients with ie.

TI  == cns mastitis: nothing to worry about?
AB  == in this paper, we analyzed a very large field data set on intramammary infections (imi) and the associated somatic cell count (scc) in dairy cows. the objective of the study was to analyze the impact of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) imi on cow scc, both mean and variability, and on the potential of these infections to have a major impact on the bulk milk scc (bmscc). data and milk samples for bacterial culture were collected by quality milk production services (qmps) between 1992 and march of 2007. the qmps program services dairy farms in new york state and other states in the northeastern usa and operates in conjunction with cornell university. only records from cows where scc and milk production data were available, and where only one organism was isolated from bacterial cultures  of milk samples (or where culture was negative) were used for this analysis. a total of 352,614 records from 4200 whole herd mastitis screening sampling qualified for this study. within herds an average of 15% (s.d. 12%) of cows sampled were infected with cns, ranging between 0 and 100%. average within herd prevalence of cows with a cns imi and an scc over 200,000 cells/ml was 2% (s.d. 4%) with a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 50%. results of linear mixed models showed three distinct populations of imi statuses: negative cultures with the lowest scc; cns and corynebacterium bovis with a moderate increase in scc, and streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus aureus showing an important increase in scc. surprisingly, milk production was slightly but significantly higher in cns infected cows compared to culture-negative cows, whereas it was strongly reduced in cows with a major pathogen imi. the percentage contribution of cns infections to the bmscc was 17.9% in herds with a bmscc less  than 200,000 cells/ml. this value decreased to 11.9 and 7.9% in herds with bulk milk scc between 200,000 and 400,000 and over 400,000 cells/ml, respectively. we  concluded that very few herds with milk quality problems would have an important  increase in bmscc that could be mostly attributed to cns infections. on the other hand, in herds with low bmscc, cns infections may be an important contributor to  the total number of somatic cells in the bulk milk.

TI  == development of a novel biochip for rapid multiplex detection of seven mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk samples.
AB  == to efficiently prevent and treat bovine mastitis and minimize its effect on the dairy industry, a sensitive, rapid, and specific test is required for identifying the mastitis-causing pathogens. in this study, a biochip capable of detecting 7 common species of mastitis-causing pathogens, including corynebacterium bovis, mycoplasma bovis, staphylococcus aureus, and the streptococcus spp. s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. dysgalactiae, and s. uberis, within 6 hr was developed.  the technique is based on dna amplification of genes specific to the target pathogens and consists of 4 basic steps: dna extraction of bacteria, polymerase chain reaction, dna hybridization, and colorimetric reaction. to examine the accuracy and specificity of this biochip, a preliminary test with 82 random quarter milk samples were analyzed and compared with results from conventional microbiological methods conducted simultaneously. results from all but 1 sample analyzed by the biochip were in agreement with those analyzed by bacteriology. the biochip could be a feasible tool for rapidly diagnosing mastitis-causing pathogens in milk and providing information for a more effective treatment to cure mastitis.

TI  == infective endocarditis associated with spondylodiscitis and frequent secondary epidural abscess.
AB  == background: although many patients with ie complain of joint, muscle, and back pain, infections at these sights are rare. indeed, in patients with back pain and endocarditis, less than 4% actually demonstrate spondylodiscitis. case description: we recently encountered 4 patients with this complication, one each  caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, and enterococcus faecalis, and wondered whether the nature of the infecting organism  determined the development of spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess. in a literature review, 36 patients with endocarditis and spondylodiscitis were identified. only 9 (25%) were caused by streptococcus viridans and the remainder  by staphylococci, enterococci, and other streptococci. usually more than 50% of all cases of ie were caused by streptococcus viridans, although more recent studies would indicate an incidence of about 40%. conclusion: we conclude that spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess is more likely to occur in those patients  with endocarditis who are infected by organisms with pyogenic potential.

AB  == the spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. we sampled 321 ibex  (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with sarcoptes scabiei. a total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with s. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. infections with mycoplasma agalactiae and mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. with escherichia coli, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida biotype a, and staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher  isolation rates were associated with adults. the isolation frequency for e. coli  was higher in females, whereas moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated  with males. the presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and m. haemolytica. the geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of branhamella ovis, m. agalactiae, and all pasteurella sp. isolations of m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, e. coli, and b. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging  rather than captive animals. of the gram-positive bacteria, s. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. mycoplasma agalactiae and m. arginini were the predominant mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. the most frequently  isolated gram-negative bacteria included e. coli, m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, and b. ovis. isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. in nasal samples, m. haemolytica and p. multocida biotype a were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, b. ovis and e. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.

TI  == prevalence of mastitis pathogens and their resistance against antimicrobial agents in dairy cows in brandenburg, germany.
AB  == the primary objective of this study was to determine management practices concerning mastitis in brandenburg, germany, the prevalence of mastitis pathogens in dairy cows, and their resistance to selected antimicrobial agents. a further objective was to study the potential effect of parity and stage of lactation on the resistance of staphylococcus aureus isolates against ampicillin. milk samples for microbiological culture were collected from 4 groups of clinically healthy cows (first lactation, >1 lactation, >50 d in milk, and >250 d in milk; 8 cows/group) in 80 dairy herds. resistance of gram-positive pathogens against 6 antimicrobial agents was tested using the broth microdilution method. mastitis pathogens were isolated from 26.4% of the milk samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns, 9.1% of quarters) and corynebacterium bovis (7.3%) were the pathogens most frequently isolated. among the major pathogens, staph. aureus (5.7%) and streptococcus uberis (1.0%) had the highest prevalence. streptococcus  agalactiae was isolated in samples from 29% of the herds. although the prevalence of most pathogens was higher in older cows, the prevalence of cns was higher in primiparous cows. results of the mastitis control questionnaire showed that cows  with clinical mastitis were transferred to a sick cow pen in 70% of the herds. cephalosporins were the drug of first choice for treatment of clinical mastitis cases followed by fixed combinations of antimicrobial agents, beta-lactamase-resistant penicillins, and penicillin. most farmers treated cows 3 to 4 times per case. cloxacillin, alone or in combination, and penicillin were most often used for dry-cow therapy. antimicrobial resistance of the pathogens was within the range of other reports. resistance of staph. aureus to ampicillin  increased significantly during the first lactation. further research is required  to determine the factors that lead to the selection of staph. aureus strains that are resistant to ampicillin during the first lactation.

AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == [study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  == objective: to study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. methods: for all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (csf) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time csf was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to  antibiotics. after the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. as soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. by the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. results: among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci or staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with streptococci, and another one with mycobacterium stercoris bovis. the tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive  to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. there were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of  streptococcal infection. the duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. conclusion: (1)intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)the effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)there are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.

TI  == risk of embolism and death in infective endocarditis: prognostic value of echocardiography: a prospective multicenter study.
AB  == background: the incidence of embolic events (ee) and death is still high in patients with infective endocarditis (ie), and data about predictors of these 2 major complications are conflicting. moreover, the exact role of echocardiography in risk stratification is not well defined. methods and results: in a multicenter prospective european study, including 384 consecutive patients (aged 57+/-17 years) with definite ie according to duke university criteria, we tested clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic data as potential predictors of  ee and 1-year mortality. transesophageal echocardiography was performed in all patients. embolism occurred before or after ie diagnosis (total-ee) in 131 patients (34.1%) and after initiation of antibiotic therapy (new-ee) in 28 patients (7.3%). staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bovis were independently associated with total-ee, whereas vegetation length >10 mm and severe vegetation  mobility were predictors of new-ee, even after adjustment for s aureus and s bovis. one-year mortality was 20.6%. in multivariable analysis, independently of  the other predictors of death (age, female sex, creatinine serum >2 mg/l, moderate or severe congestive heart failure, and s aureus) and comorbidity, vegetation length >15 mm was a predictor of 1-year mortality (adjusted relative risk=1.8; 95% ci, 1.10 to 2.82; p=0.02). conclusions: in ie, vegetation length is a strong predictor of new-ee and mortality. in combination with clinical and microbiological findings, echocardiography may identify high-risk patients who will need a more aggressive therapeutic strategy.

TI  == binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == protein(s) reactive with n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. the molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under reducing conditions. the n-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified  protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found  to react with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from different gram-negative bacteria such as esherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella abortus equi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexeneri, and serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the purified protein also reacted with e. coli o26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus, b. cereus, b. subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and corynebacterum bovis. on the other hand, porcine igg isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these lps, lta, and heat-treated bacterial cells. from the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with glcnac is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

TI  == a comparative field trial of cephalonium and cloxacillin for dry cow therapy for  mastitis in australian dairy cows.
AB  == objective: to investigate and compare the therapeutic efficacy of dry cow agents  containing either cephalonium or cloxacillin within australian dairy herds. design: a treatment-control trial. methods: milk from infected quarters of cows with high somatic cell counts in milk on eight australian dairy farms was cultured to identify bacterial pathogens. cows were randomly assigned to treatment groups and one group was treated with cephalonium at drying off and the other group was treated with cloxacillin at drying off. milk samples from infected quarters were collected immediately after calving and were cultured for  pathogens. the effect of treatment on bacteriological cure was examined and somatic cell counts from infected cows from the first two herd tests after calving were examined for a treatment effect. on four farms, milk samples were collected for culture from all cases of clinical mastitis identified within the first 7 days after calving. the effect of treatment upon incidence of clinical mastitis after calving was examined. results: there was no significant difference between treatments on quarter cure rates for new infections, for chronic infections and for infections with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus uberis. infected quarters treated with cephalonium had a significantly higher cure rate than quarters treated with cloxacillin when  corynebacterium bovis and staphylococcus epidermids were included as pathogens combined (80.3% versus 70.7%). there was no significant difference between the treatments on somatic cell counts of infected cows at the first two herd tests after calving. there was no difference between treatments on the incidence of clinical mastitis in the first 7 days after calving.

AB  == a study of 340 necropsied dairy cattle from northern bavaria resulted in 31 animals (9%) showing evidence of pyemic thromboembolism. the most frequent pathomorphologic lesions consisted in endocarditis valvularis thromboticans of the tricuspid and/or mitral valve (21), embolic pneumonia (26), nephritis (13) and renal infarction (12). the most common isolate found in bacteriologic culture was arcanobacterium pyogenes in 26 of 31 cases, followed by staphylococcus aureus (2), mannheimia haemolytica (2) and streptococcus bovis (1) in rare cases. in 27  of 31 cows a possible cause of pyemic thromboembolism was found; in 23 cases claw diseases and decubital ulcera were probably responsible.

TI  == the influence of endoscopic procedures upon the contamination of helicobacter pylori cultures.
AB  == background: among the various diagnostic methods for the detection of helicobacter pylori infection, histological examination and microbiological processing of gastric biopsy samples are assumed to be the gold standard techniques. aims: since h. pylori culture can be affected by the presence of non-h. pylori bacteria, we evaluated the efficacy of endoscope disinfection and the influence of endoscopic procedures on culture contamination. patients and methods: the procedures used during the first two routine endoscopies were evaluated during 28 consecutive days. endoscopy room, forceps and endoscopic channel were analyzed before and after the beginning of normal procedures. after  disinfection, a biopsy simulation was performed to verify the gastric bacteria. results: endoscope disinfection removed all organisms from forceps and endoscopic channel with 100% efficacy. the most frequent non-h. pylori bacteria detected were streptococcus bovis, enterobacter hormaechei, and staphylococcus aureus. the sensibility of the h. pylori culture was affected by the presence of non-h. pylori bacteria. conclusion: the risk of transmission of microorganisms was not detectable when sterilized biopsy forceps and stringent disinfection standards were employed. whilst s. bovis and e. hormaechei may be common in gastric microbial flora, the presence of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus indicated that the manipulation of biopsies could be responsible for culture contamination with these bacteria.

TI  == bovine mastitis in finland 2001--prevalence, distribution of bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == a nationwide survey was conducted in finland to estimate prevalence of bovine mastitis, distribution of mastitis pathogens, and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of different mastitis pathogens. in total, 12,661 quarter milk samples were collected from 3282 dairy cows at 216 farms. these were randomly selected from a database covering all finnish dairy farms. quarter milk samples collected by the dairy advisors were submitted for somatic cell counting, bacteriological examination, and testing for antimicrobial susceptibility. if the milk scc of a cow or of a quarter exceeded 300,000/ml, the cow was defined as having mastitis. the results were compared with those of a previous survey done in 1995. the prevalence of mastitis continued to decrease from 38% in 1995 to 31% in 2001. compared with the study from 1995, the number of quarters with bacterial growth in 2001 increased significantly from 21.0 to 33.5%. this mainly resulted from increased prevalence of corynebacterium bovis. coagulase-negative staphylococci remained the most common bacterial group, comprising almost one-half of the pathogens isolated, whereas the relative number of staphylococcus aureus isolations decreased from the time of the previous study. according to in  vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the enterococci demonstrated the highest level of resistance. compared with the other nordic countries, penicillin resistance among the staphylococci was still at a relatively high level in finland (52.1 and 32.0% for staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively). streptococci isolated from mastitis were very susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, as also found in the previous survey in 1995.

TI  == efficacy of extended ceftiofur intramammary therapy for treatment of subclinical  mastitis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  == little research has focused on treatment of cows with subclinical mastitis during lactation. ceftiofur is a new broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic for veterinary use that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with enzymes essential for peptidoglycan synthesis. ceftiofur should  be effective against a wide range of contagious and environmental mastitis pathogens. objectives of the present study were to evaluate the efficacy of ceftiofur for treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows, and to determine if extended therapy regimens enhanced efficacy of ceftiofur. holstein and jersey dairy cows (n = 88) from 3 dairy research herds were used. cows were enrolled in the study based on milk somatic cell counts >400,000/ml and isolation of the same mastitis pathogen in 2 samples obtained 1 wk apart. cows with one or  more intramammary infections (imi) were blocked by parity and dim and allocated randomly to 1 of 3 different ceftiofur treatment regimens: 2-d (n = 49 imi), 5-d  (n = 41 imi), and 8-d (n = 38 imi) treatment regimens. for all groups, 125 mg of  ceftiofur hydrochloride was administered via intramammary infusion. eighteen cows with 38 imi were included as an untreated negative control group. a bacteriological cure was defined as a treated infected mammary quarter that was bacteriologically negative for the presence of previously identified bacteria at  14 and 28 d after the last treatment. efficacy of ceftiofur therapy against all subclinical imi was 38.8, 53.7, and 65.8% for the 2-, 5-, and 8-d ceftiofur treatment regimens, respectively. four of 38 (10.5%) imi in control cows were cured spontaneously without treatment. all 3 ceftiofur treatment regimens were significantly better than the negative control, and the 8-d extended ceftiofur treatment regimen treatment group was significantly better than the standard 2-d  treatment group. pathogen groups had significantly different cure rates from one  another. the cure rate for the 8-d extended ceftiofur treatment regimen was 70% for corynebacterium bovis, 86% for coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, 36% for staph. aureus, 80% for streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. dysgalactiae, and 67%  for strep. uberis.

TI  == causative organisms of infective endocarditis according to host status.
AB  == a prospective study of infective endocarditis (ie) was conducted between 1994 and 2000 in marseilles, france, and included 170 definite cases diagnosed with the use of modified duke criteria. classification of ie based on the aetiological agent was related to epidemiological characteristics, including age, gender and the nature of the injured valve. enterococci and streptococcus bovis were identified more frequently in older subjects (p 0.02), and s. bovis was also associated with mitral valve infection (p 0.03). streptococcus spp. were found to be associated with native valves (p < 10(-3)), whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci and coxiella burnetii were associated with intracardiac prosthetic  material (p < 0.05). s. bovis and staphylococcus aureus were the predominant species associated with presumably healthy valves (p < 0.05), whereas oral streptococci caused ie exclusively in patients with previous valve damage. the basic host status of ie patients has been linked to specific microorganisms, and  this may be of value when empirical treatment is needed in patients who have received previous antibiotic therapy and whose blood cultures are negative.

TI  == quarter milk somatic cell count in infected dairy cows: a meta-analysis.
AB  == the aim of this paper was to evaluate the effects associated with intramammary infection (imi) by a bacterium or a group of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, coliforms, staphylococci other than s. aureus, and corynebacterium bovis) on the  somatic cell count (scc) in quarter milk of dairy cows. papers selected for analysis had to provide scc values associated with the natural infection in quarters by different bacteria. sampling for measurement of scc and determination of the infection had to be done on the same day. only papers published in english or in french after 1971 were considered. twenty-one papers fulfilled the selection criteria. the animals sampled, the measurement techniques for scc and the bacteriological identification, as well as the definition of the infection, all differed widely among the selected studies. the meta-analysis method was used to estimate both the mean scc (arithmetic and geometric) value and the average increase on scc of each type of infection. the geometric mean scc in bacteriologically negative quarters was 68 000 c/ml. in case of imi, the retained scc was 357 000, 857 000, 547 000, 1 024 000, 1 151 000, 138 000 and 105 000 c/ml in quarters infected by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, coliforms, staphylococci other  than s. aureus and corynebacterium bovis, respectively. the variation factors that could influence these scc values and the bacteriological results are discussed.

TI  == special issues in the management of infective endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci.
AB  == gram-positive cocci, mainly streptococci and staphylococci, continue to cause the majority of cases of infective endocarditis. among the streptococci causing ie, the long-standing predominance of oral or viridans-group streptococci has progressively faded, while the number of cases caused by "enteric streptococci" (streptococcus bovis and enterococci) has increased. while most oral streptococci and s. bovis strains remain fully sensitive to penicillin, nutritionally variant  streptococci--now renamed abiotrophia--and enterococci can exhibit resistance to  penicillin and/or glycopeptides that makes endocarditis more difficult to treat.  among the staphylococci causing endocarditis, the increasing proportion of coagulase-negative and methicillin-resistant strains observed in recent years has changed the approach to choice of antibiotic therapy. the purpose of this paper is to focus on some new aspects of the management of antibiotic therapy of ie due to streptococci and staphylococci, including recent developments such as once-daily aminoglycoside administration in ie, outpatient antibiotic therapy, and the evaluation of new antibiotics.

AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == lactoferrin concentration in milk of bovine clinical mastitis.
AB  == the lactoferrin (lf) concentration in the milk from dairy cows with clinical mastitis was determined to evaluate the relationship between the lf concentration (lfc) in milk and the non-specific defensive capability of the udder. the mean lfc in 368 milk samples from 319 cows with clinical mastitis was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that of normal cows. the mean lfc in milk from quarters infected with mycoplasma bovis or staphylococcus aureus was significantly higher  (p < 0.05) than that of quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns). in escherichia coli mastitis, the level of lfc in milk from cows with peracute mastitis was significantly lower (p < 0.01) than that from cows with acute mastitis. in cases of mastitis due to e. coli, the mean lfc in milk from cows that needed more than 10 days to recover from the mastitis or were not cured was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that for cows which took less than 10 days to be cured. the mean lfc in milk from cows with peracute e. coli mastitis was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that for cows with mastitis associated with environmental streptococci or cns, although these low lf levels were somewhat increased after 46 h from the occurrence of mastitis. these results suggest that the decreased levels of lf in peracute e. coli mastitis may be associated with the progress of inflammation in the early phase of mastitis.

TI  == evaluation of a postmilking teat disinfectant containing a phenolic combination for the prevention of mastitis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  == a trial was conducted for 12 months in a herd of 120 holstein cows in order to determine the efficacy of a teat disinfectant, which contained a phenolic combination, for the prevention of bovine intramammary infections during lactation. postmilking teat disinfection was compared to a negative control using a split-udder experimental design. the percentage of quarters newly infected by mastitis pathogens was 45% lower in mammary glands with teats that had been dipped in the experimental teat disinfectant after milking than it was in undipped controls. new infections caused by streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus  aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, and corynebacterium bovis were significantly lower in mammary glands with teats that had been dipped in the experimental teat disinfectant than in undipped controls. no statistical differences in the incidence of clinical mastitis between treatment groups were observed. no irritation or chapping of teats dipped in the experimental teat disinfectant were observed. the results of this study suggest that the experimental teat disinfectant containing a phenolic combination is an effective  postmilking teat disinfectant for use in the prevention of new intramammary infections by both contagious and environmental mastitis pathogens.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial activity of alexomycin (pnu-82, 127), a peptide compound projected for use in animal health.
AB  == alexomycin (pnu-82, 127) is a thiopeptide antimicrobial complex intended for veterinary practice that belongs to a series of cyclic peptides produced by streptomyces arginensis. mics against selected routine and fastidious clinical isolates of animal and human origin were determined by broth microdilution or agar dilution reference methods. alexomycin was active against gram-positive pathogens such as oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and  coagulase-negative staphylococci (260 strains; mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml), as well  as enterococcus species (95 strains; mic90, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml), and generally inactive against gram-negative aerobes. alexomycin had more potent activity against streptococcus bovis (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), s. agalactiae (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml), corynebacterium species (mic90, 0.06-0.12 microgram/ml), and listeria monocytogenes (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). alexomycin activity was limited against bacillus species (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), neisseria  meningiditis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml). this thiopeptide complex was also found to be stable at low concentrations (0.015-32 micrograms/ml) in mueller-hinton broth for up to 24 h, possesses static antimicrobial activity and  did not produce resistant mutants after multiple passages at subinhibitory drug concentrations. alexomycin seems to have potential for use as a feed additive to  increase feed efficiency and promote growth in poultry and swine as well as other applications against gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == correlation between quinolone susceptibility patterns and sequences in the a and  b subunits of dna gyrase in mycobacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activities of seven quinolones and the sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) in the a and b subunits of dna gyrase were  determined for 14 mycobacterial species. on the basis of quinolone activity, quinolones were arranged from that with the greatest to that with the least activity as follows: sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, flumequine, and nalidixic acid. based on mics, the species could be organized into three groups: resistant (mycobacterium avium, m. intracellulare, m. marinum, m. chelonae, m. abscessus [ofloxacin mics, >/=8 microg/ml]), moderately susceptible (m. tuberculosis, m. bovis bcg, m. kansasii, m. leprae, m. fortuitum third biovariant, m. smegmatis [ofloxacin mics, 0.5 to 1 microg/ml]), and susceptible (m. fortuitum, m. peregrinum, m. aurum [ofloxacin mics, </=0.25 microg/ml]). peptide sequences of the qrdr of gyrb were identical in all the species, including the amino acids at the three positions known to be involved in acquired resistance to quinolone, i.e., 426 (asp), 447 (arg), and 464 (asn) (numbering system used for escherichia coli). the last two residues could be involved in the overall low level of susceptibility of mycobacteria to quinolones since they differ from those found in the very susceptible e. coli (lys-447 and ser-464) but are identical to those found in the less susceptible staphylococcus  aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. peptide sequences of the qrdr of gyra were identical in all the species, except for the amino acid at position 83, which was an alanine in the two less susceptible groups and a serine in the most susceptible one, as in e. coli, suggesting that this amino acid is involved in the observed differences of quinolone susceptibility within the mycobacterium genus.

AB  == strain differentiation of staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. rea of 19 methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. fifty-three isolates of s. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of rea pattern. rea patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those  from different staphylococcus species. a total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 s. pneumoniae isolates. there was some correlation between the rea patterns and serotypes. in addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. sixteen isolates of e. coli o157 and 18 isolates of e. coli o25 were analyzed by rea with haeiii. among 14 epidemiologically unrelated e. coli o157:h7 isolates, rea patterns were either identical or differed only by  a few fragment bands. rea patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing e. coli o25 from an outbreak were identical. eight distinct rea patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic c. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. candida strains belonging to different six candida species were analysed by rea. all c. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains  were divided into 37 groups according to the rea patterns. each candida strain showed species-specific rea patterns. twenty-one isolates of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by pcr with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of is6110(is6110-pcr). the results of pcr of 19 m. tuberculosis isolates and 2 m. bovis bcg isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. our results demonstrated that rea of genomic dna with hinfi or haeiii was a useful tool for strain differentiation. by comparing the species-specific rea patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of candida  and staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. because is6110-pcr is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate m. tuberculosis strains.

TI  == clinical mastitis in dairy cattle in ontario: frequency of occurrence and bacteriological isolates.
AB  == the objective of this study was to describe the frequency of occurrence of clinical mastitis in dairy herds in ontario. the study group consisted of 65 dairy farms involved in a 2-year observational study, which included recording all clinical mastitis cases and milk sampling of quarters with clinical mastitis. lactational incidence risks of 9.8% for abnormal milk only, 8.2% for abnormal milk with a hard or swollen udder, and 4.4% for abnormal milk plus systemic signs of illness related to mastitis were calculated for 2840 cows and heifers. overall, 19.8% of cows experienced one or more cases of clinical mastitis during  location. teat injuries occurred in 2.1% of lactations. standard bacteriology was performed on pretreatment milk samples from 834 cows with clinical mastitis. the  bacteria isolated were staphylococcus aureus (6.7%), streptococcus agalactiae (0.7%), other streptococcus spp. (14.1%), coliforms (17.2%), gram-positive bacilli (5.5%), corynebacterium bovis (1.7%), and other staphylococcus spp. (28.7%). there was no growth in 17.7% of samples, and 8.3% of samples were contaminated. clinical mastitis is a common disease in dairy cows in ontario; approximately 1 in 5 cow lactations have at lease one episode of clinical mastitis. there is, however, considerable variation in the incidence of clinical  mastitis among farms. the majority of 1st cases of clinical mastitis occur early  in lactation, and the risk of clinical mastitis increases with increasing parity. environmental, contagious, and minor pathogens were all associated with cases of  clinical mastitis.

TI  == influence of parity and stage of lactation on the somatic cell count in bacteriologically negative dairy cows.
AB  == this study examines the influence of parity, stage of lactation, and single isolations (i.e., the isolation of a microorganism that could not be reisolated in the same quarter in the next sampling) of staphylococci other than staphylococcus aureus (coagulase-negative staphylococci), corynebacterium bovis,  or esculin-positive cocci other than streptococcus uberis (referred to as esculin-positive cocci throughout) on the monthly log(e)-transformed somatic cell count (scc) for 180 first, second, and third parity cows that were observed over  a whole lactation. repeated measures anova was used to analyze the data. no significant effect was found for the infection variable. however, the results indicated that even single isolations of coagulase-negative staphylocci, c. bovis, or esculin-positive cocci resulted in a numerical or statistically significant increase in scc. least squares mean scc (log(e)-transformed) for bacterio-logically negative cows and cows with single isolations of coagulase-negative staphylococci, c. bovis, or esculin-positive cocci were 3.90,  3.97, 4.08, and 4.17, respectively. significant effects of parity, stage of lactation, and the interaction of parity and stage of lactation could not be found when only bacteriologically negative cows were considered. least squares mean scc for first, second, and third parity cows were 3.80, 3.93, and 3.97, respectively. however, the effects of parity, stage of lactation, and the interaction of parity and stage of lactation were significant when all 180 cows were included. therefore, these effects must be due to factors that were present  in the infected groups.

TI  == estimation of interdependence among quarters of the bovine udder with subclinical mastitis and implications for analysis.
AB  == interdependency among udder quarters with subclinical mastitis was evaluated on 150 farms using a total of 35,828 udder quarters. the occurrence of high somatic  cell count (scc) (> 250,000 cells/ml) in 0, 3, and 4 quarters occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. for all bacterial species, intramammary infection in 0, 2, 3, or 4 quarters of the same cow occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. intramammary infection and high scc were found less often in front quarters than in rear quarters. high scc and intramammary infection occurred more often in right front quarters than in left front quarters. high scc in diagonal quarters occurred at a lower rate than expected. corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus had the highest intraclass correlation within herd. streptococcus uberis had a very low intraclass correlation within herd. the intraclass correlation within cow for the natural logarithm of scc was 0.47. corynebacterium bovis and strep. agalactiae had the highest intraclass correlation within cow, and streptococcus dysgalactiae had the lowest. analytical methods were proposed to manage the problem of interdependence and its effect on the design or evaluation of field studies on subclinical mastitis.

TI  == association between management practices, dairy herd characteristics, and somatic cell count of bulk tank milk.
AB  == objective: to determine whether particular dairy management practices and herd characteristics were associated with somatic cell count (scc) of bulk tank milk.  design: analysis of records. sample population: milk samples collected from 59,435 cows housed in 843 dairy herds between march 1992 and june 1994. procedure: results of bacterial culture of milk samples and data on farm housing, sanitation, milking system, and management were collected. multiple regression analysis was used to determine sources of variation in bulk tank milk scc among herds. results: prevalence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus  mastitis was associated with bulk tank milk scc. in herds free of s agalactiae mastitis, prevalence of s aureus and corynebacterium bovis mastitis were important. for herds without s agalactiae mastitis, use of sawdust bedding was associated with a decrease in scc and a dirty loose housing area was associated with an increase. increased milk production, repeated mastitis control visits, and use of particular predip compounds were significantly associated with reduced scc in all herds, regardless of whether any cows in the herd had s agalactiae mastitis. in herds with s agalactiae mastitis, use of iodine (certain concentrations), chlorhexidine, peroxide, or sodium chlorite-lactic acid as a predip was associated with a decrease in scc. only use of sodium chlorite-lactic  acid predip was significantly associated with a decrease in scc in herds without  s agalactiae mastitis. clinical implications: important factors associated with bulk tank milk scc were prevalence of s agalactiae and s aureus mastitis, careful application of particular predip compounds, avoiding a dirty loose housing area,  and use of a service to regularly monitor prevalence of mastitis in the herd.

(ab titers were > or = 1/512 and igm > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients  1 year later). heterologous ab: in spite of statistically significant difference  found in sie versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256)  is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. conclusions: the utility of homologous ab for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. on the contrary for heterologous ab, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.

AB  == the objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of mastitis among primiparous heifers at calving and at drying off in 11 waikato dairy herds during the 1993-94 dairy production season. duplicate quarter milk samples were collected aseptically from 458 heifers within 5 days after calving for bacteriological analysis. mastitis was diagnosed in at least one quarter in 35.6% of these heifers. coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from 21.8% of the heifers. the prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci varied between herds from 4.3% to 44.8%. environmental streptococci caused mastitis in 12.2% of  heifers, ranging from 5.6% to 24.1% between herds. streptococcus uberus was the pathogen identified most frequently at calving and accounted for more than 90% of the streptococcal isolates. staphylococcus aureus and coliforms were isolated from less than 1% of samples. clinical mastitis was observed in 8.1% of heifers at calving; environmental streptococci were isolated from 67.6% of these clinical clinical cases. only 2.8% of heifers developed clinical mastitis during lactation and environmental streptococci were isolated from 38.5% of these cases. the prevalence of mastitis among 428 of the heifers at drying off was 64.7%; a 1.8 fold increase during lactation. corynebactetium bovis was isolated from 43% of heifers at drying off even though it was not isolated from any heifers at calving. during the season, the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus mastitis increased to 2.8% while mastitis caused by environmental streptococci declined to 2.8%. the prevalence of environmental mastitis pathogens decreased during lactation while contagious pathogens increased in each of the 11 herds. ineffective post-milking teat sanitation probably contributed to the increase in  mastitis caused by contagious pathogens. specific factors were not determined that affected the variation in prevalence between herds.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == field trial evaluation of two teat dips containing nisin or polyvinylpyrrolidone  iodophor designed for use before and after milking.
AB  == in a first trial involving six commercial dairy herds and 291 cows for a period of eight months, pre-milking udder sanitation by dipping teats in a 0.25% polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp) iodophor product followed by wiping with paper towels  was compared in each herd with traditional teat washing and wiping with individual udder cloths. the incidence of new intramammary infections by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis and corynebacterium bovis were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced, respectively by 48%, 60% and 47%. there were no significant differences in the two groups of cows for other intramammary infections, total bacterial counts, clostridia spore counts, iodine residues in milk or teat condition scores. in a second trial involving nine commercial dairy  herds and 367 cows for a period of seven months, a teat dip containing nisin used before and after milking was compared in each herd with a classical 0.5% iodophor product used in the same way. there was no significant difference in the incidence of new intramammary infections, in spite of a higher rate of new staphylococcus aureus infections in the group of cows teat-dipped with the nisin  product (p = 0.06). it was concluded that pre-dipping with teat dips specifically designed to be safely used before milking can be more efficient than traditional  pre-milking udder preparation. these teat dips, when used before and after milking, seem to be as efficient as products which should normally be restricted  to post-milking use.

TI  == positive inotropic effect of streptococcus faecalis in isolated cardiac muscle.
AB  == infective endocarditis is caused by bacterial colonization of the endocardium. because endocardium modulates mechanical performance of subjacent myocardium, we  studied acute effects of bacteria on isolated cardiac muscle and on the functional role of the endocardium. bacteria, grown in broth at 37 degrees c, were added at increasing concentrations (10(2) to 10(6) bacteria/ml) to cat papillary muscles in krebs-ringer solution (1.25 mm ca2+, 35 degrees c). the endocardial surface was damaged by exposing muscles to a stream of dry air for 30 s. streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis induced significant increases in total peak isometric twitch tension (tt) and maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (vmax) and significant decreases in time to tt (tttt) and time to half isometric  twitch tension decline (rt 1/2), both before and after removal of endocardial endothelium. this response could also be elicited with bacterial filtrate, after  boiling the filtrate or after extracting the polysaccharides from it with kio4. increasing ca2+ concentrations progressively reduced the response to the filtrate. propranolol slightly, although not significantly, diminished the effects on tt and vmax while abolishing the effects on tttt and on rt 1/2. by contrast, streptococcus bovis and staphylococcus aureus did not affect tt or vmax but induced a slight but significant decrease in tttt at the highest concentration of bacteria. accordingly, the filtrate of strep. faecalis induces a positive inotropic effect. the active component is neither a protein nor a polysaccharide, and its effect may be partly beta-adrenoceptor mediated. strep. bovis and staph. aureus have negligible acute effects on contractility.

TI  == penetration of ceftriaxone into the intervertebral disc.
AB  == concentrations of ceftriaxone in serum and intervertebral disc tissue were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography in forty-five patients after  a single intravenous loading dose of 1000 milligrams given at different intervals before an operation on the spine. the mean serum concentrations in this study corresponded well with reported values. the mean tissue concentrations were 5.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 3.6 to 6.8 micrograms per gram) one to less than two hours after administration of the antibiotic, 6.4 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 2.8 to 10.0 micrograms per  gram) two to less than four hours, and 3.6 micrograms per gram (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.6 to 6.6 micrograms per gram) at fourteen to less than sixteen hours. these drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration that was effective against 90 per cent of the bacteria for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus; for streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, viridans, pneumoniae, and bovis; and for community-acquired enterobacteriaceae. the average serum-to-tissue ratio was 191:1 at less than one-half hour and 13:1 at less than one and a half hours. the lower values of the 95 per cent confidence intervals for the concentration of the antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the disc tissue against most susceptible bacteria during the period between one and a half and four hours, but a larger bolus would be needed to maintain this level for a longer period (such as in a longer operation) and as prophylaxis against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

TI  == endocarditis with pericardial bioprostheses: clinico-pathologic characteristics,  immediate and long term prognosis.
AB  == between 1977 and 1992, 30 consecutive episodes of infective endocarditis in 28 patients involving pericardial bioprostheses were diagnosed and treated in our hospital. eleven (37%) were early pericardial valve endocarditis occurring in the first 60 days following valve surgery, and 19 (63%) were late endocarditis. in both the early and late groups, more aortic that mitral valves were affected (19/30). the most frequent pathogen in the early cases was staphylococcus, (s. epidermidis in five cases, s. aureus in one). the most frequent pathogen among late cases was streptococcus: (st. viridans in four, st. faecalis in two, st. bovis in one). in four cases (13%) no pathogen was isolated. twelve patients received antibiotic treatment alone, six specific for the pathogen and other six  only arbitrarily chosen regimen. all patients were cured in the former and all patients died in the latter group (four with negative blood cultures and two in whom identification of the pathogen was delayed-proteus mirabillis in one case and brucella mellitensis in the other). valve replacement during the infective endocarditis episode was necessary in 18 cases, either because of failure of the  antibiotic treatment or because of heart failure secondary to prosthetic malfunction. peri-annular abscess was present in five cases. surgical mortality was 22.2% (4/18). in all, 11 patients (39%) died during the active stage of infective endocarditis. the most frequent cause of death was heart failure (45.5%). all four patients with negative blood cultures died. the most advisable  strategy for treating bacterial endocarditis of pericardial bioprostheses is a combination of antibiotic therapy and early surgery, especially in cases of staphylococcus endocarditis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [bacterial endocarditis: current bacteriological data].
AB  == the bacteria causing infective endocarditis have not changed significantly despite the diversity of potential portals of entry. streptococci (viridans) cause 35 to 45% of cases of endocarditis. group d streptococci of gastrointestinal origin cause about 20% of cases of endocarditis: streptococcus bovis is the most commonly isolated species followed by the enterococcus. the beta-haemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, c and g are rarely isolated. seventeen to thirty per cent of endocarditis is caused by staphylococci, above all staphylococcus aureus. these infections are mainly observed in patients with  prosthetic valves or intravenous catheters and in intravenous drug addicts. with  respect to gram-negative bacilli, enterobacteria are rarely responsible for endocarditis and those of the hacek group (haemophilus, actinobacillus, cardiobacterium, etc.) were isolated in 3% of cases. q fever and chlamydia endocarditis are rare, as are fungal infections usually due to candida. endocarditis with negative blood cultures is still observed in about 10% of cases.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome, a new fourth-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpirome was compared with amoxycillin/clavulanic  acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and amikacin against 743 non-duplicate clinical isolates. mic50 and mic90 showed that the antibiotic was active against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. cefpirome was highly active against most of the enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus spp., aeromonas spp. (mic < or = 1 mg/l) and salmonella spp. (mic < or = 0.5 mg/l). neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were all susceptible, with mic less than 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l respectively. cefpirome was more active than cefuroxime and ceftazidime against campylobacter spp. (mic < or = 2 mg/l), but less active than  ceftazidime against pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefpirome was active against streptococcus pneumoniae. streptococcus bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic < or = 0.5 mg/l) and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l). methicillin-resistant s. aureus, gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes were resistant to cefpirome. the stability of cefpirome to tem-1, tem-2, pse-1, shv-1 and the chromosomal-mediated p99 and k-1 beta-lactamases was comparable to ceftazidime.

TI  == scleral flap necrosis and infectious endophthalmitis after cataract surgery with  a scleral tunnel incision.
AB  == background: long scleral tunnel dissection techniques have been developed for cataract surgery incisions. these incisions reduce postoperative astigmatism and  keratorefractive instability. if fashioned correctly, the internal lip of the incision produces a tight seal to the anterior chamber, permissible of sutureless surgery. the behavior of such a wound during intraocular infection is unknown. methods: the authors describe two elderly patients in whom postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis was accompanied by infectious scleritis, infectious sclerokeratitis or keratitis, and rapid scleral flap necrosis. one of the patients had a painless disease process. results: intraocular isolates of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus equinus were recovered from the two patients, respectively. management was complicated by loss of tectonic integrity  that followed scleral flap necrosis, by impaired vitreoretinal visualization associated with rapidly progressive sclerokeratitis or keratitis, and by bacterial scleritis in the base of the scleral flap. no light perception was retained in either eye. conclusion: scleral tunnel incisions create a potential abscess cavity. although a rare occurrence, postoperative endophthalmitis in such an eye may present major surgical and therapeutic problems intrinsic to the wound design.

AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a premilking teat disinfectant for the prevention of mastitis in dairy cows under natural exposure  conditions. predipping was compared with a negative control using a split udder experimental design. all teats were dipped after milking with the same teat dip.  percentage of quarters newly infected by major mastitis pathogens was 34% lower in quarters with teats predipped and postdipped than in quarters with teats postdipped only. new imi by streptococcus uberis and staphylococcus aureus were significantly lower in quarters with teats predipped and postdipped than in quarters with teats postdipped only. differences in incidence of clinical mastitis between treatment groups approached significance. predipping and postdipping were no more effective against gram-negative bacteria, coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, and corynebacterium bovis than postdipping only. no chapping or irritation of teats was observed, and no adverse effects were noted using the test product as a premilking and postmilking teat disinfectant. results of this study suggest that predipping and then postdipping  with the test product was a more effective procedure against major mastitis pathogens than postdipping only.

AB  == a natural exposure trial was conducted for 12 mo in a herd of 150 lactating jersey cows to determine efficacy of a .35% chlorhexidine teat dip containing a glycerine emollient for the prevention of bovine intramammary infections. right teats of cows were dipped in the experimental teat dip after milking machine removal and left teats were not dipped. the herd was free of streptococcus agalactiae and had a low prevalence of staphylococcus aureus. most new major pathogen intramammary infections resulted from streptococcus species, primarily streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae. new infections by streptococcus species were significantly lower in teats dipped in chlorhexidine than in undipped teats. overall efficacy of the chlorhexidine teat dip against major mastitis pathogens was 50%. the experimental teat dip also reduced coagulase-negative staphylococcus species infections 49.0% and corynebacterium bovis infections 65.2%. overall efficacy against minor mastitis pathogens was 54.0%. no irritation or chapping of teats dipped in the experimental teat dip was observed.

TI  == [community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. iii. microbiological aspects].
AB  == a retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the ivrea-castellamonte hospital (turin, italy). a total of 4386 vials  from 619 patients were examined. there were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. there were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). a total of 165 microorganism were isolated: gram-positive (52.7%) and gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). the predominant families were: enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), micrococcaceae (27.3%), pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and streptococcus "genus" (18.8%). the species frequencies  were: escherichia coli (20%), staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), enterococcus (8.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), proteus mirabilis (4.2%), brucella spp. (2.4%), bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus bovis e propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). these findings are compared with those published in the italian and international literature. stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.

TI  == [milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. the study was aimed to  detect the following bacteria: streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces pyogenes, enterobacteriaceae rods, corynebacterium bovis, and micrococcus sp. milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. milk productivity was determined on the day  of bacterial isolation. statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on  the health condition of their udder. it seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.

TI  == properties of a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) extracted from intact cells of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == intramammary infections and risk factors for clinical mastitis in herds with low  somatic cell counts in bulk milk.
AB  == ten herds with low somatic cell counts in bulk milk had an incidence of clinical  mastitis of only 2.2 per 100 cows whereas 10 other herds with similarly low cell  counts had an incidence of 53.6 per 100 cows. the major pathogens in the herds with a high incidence were escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, staphylococcus aureus and the coagulase-negative staphylococci. the percentage of uninfected quarters in the herds with a high incidence of clinical mastitis was 21.4 per cent compared with 12.2 per cent in the herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis. the prevalence of coagulase-negative staphylococci, corynebacterium bovis and micrococcus species was higher in the herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis. there was a significant linear relationship between the percentage of uninfected quarters and the incidence of clinical mastitis in the herds with a high incidence of clinical mastitis. in herds with a low incidence of clinical mastitis significantly less teat disinfection after milking was practised. the results suggest that infections with minor pathogens tend to protect cows against mastitis, and that teat disinfection after milking may increase the percentage of uninfected quarters and lead to an increased risk of clinical mastitis in herds with low somatic cell counts in bulk milk.

TI  == evaluation of teicoplanin for treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci in 20 patients.
AB  == teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin, was evaluated for the treatment of bacterial endocarditis in an open multicenter study from may 1985 to august 1987. a total of 20 patients with positive blood culture endocarditis received teicoplanin once daily as a mean intravenous injection of 7.3 mg/kg of body weight (range, 4.8 to 10.6 mg/kg); in 17 patients, teicoplanin  was combined with another antibiotic, usually an aminoglycoside. the mean duration of therapy was 28 days (range, 7 to 66 days). the diagnosis of endocarditis was confirmed by echocardiography or anatomical findings in 15 patients and established on the basis of clinical manifestations plus positive blood cultures in 5 patients. the tricuspid valve was involved in 11 of the 20 patients. isolates from blood were 12 staphylococcus aureus, 1 staphylococcus hominis, 1 micrococcus sedentarius, 1 enterococcus faecalis, 3 streptococcus bovis, and 2 nongroupable streptococcus sp. at the end of therapy, bacterial eradication was achieved in 17 of 20 patients (85%), and a favorable clinical outcome had occurred in 14 of 17 evaluable patients (82%). of these 14 patients,  one relapsed 4 months after the end of treatment. thus, teicoplanin was effective in 13 of 17 patients (76%). mean peak levels of teicoplanin in serum were lower,  23.1 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml, in patients who failed than in those who were cured (45.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/ml). side effects occurred in 7 of 20 patients (35%), and required premature discontinuation of teicoplanin in 3 patients. these side effects were fever in three patients, rash in three patients, hearing loss in two patients, and increased serum transaminase levels in two patients. this study demonstrates the efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis and the need for achieving peak levels in serum close to 40 micrograms/ml. teicoplanin should now be further evaluated in endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci means of controlled comparative study with standard therapy.

TI  == frequency of isolation of environmental mastitis-causing pathogens and incidence  of new intramammary infection during the nonlactating period.
AB  == quarter samples (n = 6,328) of mammary secretions were collected from 160 cows during physiologic transitions of the udder to determine the frequency of isolation of mastitis-causing pathogens and the incidence of new intramammary infections (imi) during the nonlactating period. none of the cows in the herd was infected with streptococcus agalactiae, and the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus was low. cows were not treated with antibiotics at cessation of milking. a threefold increase in the percentage of quarters infected with major mastitis-causing pathogens developed from late lactation to early involution. coliforms and streptococci other than str agalactiae accounted for 94% of major pathogen infections. the number of quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci increased slightly from late lactation to early involution, whereas the number of quarters infected with corynebacterium bovis decreased markedly. major pathogens caused 101 of 153 imi at parturition and greater than 90% were caused by streptococci and coliforms. at parturition, 51 of 52 minor pathogen imi were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. during early lactation, there was a marked decrease in quarters infected with major pathogens; however, the number of quarters with major pathogen imi during early lactation was 2.3 times higher than the number of quarters infected before cessation of milking. the number of quarters with minor pathogen imi during early lactation was the same as at parturition, but a marked decrease in quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci and a marked increase in c bovis imi developed from parturition to early lactation.

TI  == effect of naturally occurring intramammary infections by minor pathogens on new infections by major pathogens in cattle.
AB  == new mammary infections were recorded in 3 dairy herds during a lactation period by bacteriologic examination of milk samples at 3-week intervals. influences of the infection status of quarters at the time of new infection and of microorganisms responsible for bacterial invasion were analyzed. the new infection rate in uninfected quarters was about 3 times the rate in quarters already harboring bacterial considered minor pathogens (coagulase-negative staphylococci and corynebacterium bovis) or major pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococci). the frequency of new infections with major pathogens was almost halved by preexisting infections with minor pathogens (p = 0.05), mainly because of coagulase-negative staphylococci (p = 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, c bovis (p = 0.19). new infections by minor pathogens also were less frequent in quarters harboring a major pathogen (p less than 0.05), indicating that the competition or antagonism between mammary infections was a general phenomenon.

TI  == growth inhibition of mastitis pathogens by long-chain fatty acids.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, and corynebacterium bovis were tested for sensitivity to long-chain fatty acids predominant in teat canal keratin. antibacterial activity of free fatty acids on  each bacterial species was measured after 12 and 24 h in chemically defined media. polyene c18:2 and c18:3 acids were bactericidal to each species at less than or equal to 10(5) ng/ml-1. the most bacteriostatic saturated fatty acids were c12 and c14. streptococcus agalactiae growth was inhibited more by fatty acids after 24 h than after 12 h. no incubation time effect on growth responses of other species was determined. polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate had a neutralizing effect on the bactericidal activity of polyene acids on c. bovis. corynebacterium bovis were unable to grow in synthetic media containing individual free fatty acids as the sole source of preformed fatty acids. a relationship between bacterial species commonly isolated from bovine teat canals  with resistance to fatty acids predominant in keratin was not evident.

AB  == effect of an automatic iodine (15 ppm) backflushing system on incidence of new intramammary infections, teatcup liner bacterial populations, and milk iodine was tested in a herd free of streptococcus agalactiae and with a low prevalence of staphylococcus aureus. in an 11-mo trial, backflushing was applied to teatcups that milked the right half of the udder; the left half served as control. clawpieces were divided into left and right halves with each having a milk outlet. postmilking teat dipping was discontinued. all lactating cows in the university herd were used, averaging 154 with normal attrition and additions of new individuals as they calved. backflushing reduced numbers of staphylococci recovered from liners by 98.5% and gram-negative bacteria by 99.5% as compared with unflushed liners. backflushing significantly reduced new infections caused by corynebacterium bovis. however, there was no effect on incidence of new infections by staphylococci, streptococci, or coliforms. iodine concentrations averaged 243 micrograms per liter in milk from control quarters and 486 micrograms from backflushed udder halves. interior surface cracking was more severe in backflushed teatcup liners than in control liners. these results do not justify the use of backflushing in a herd with low prevalence of contagious pathogens.

AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

TI  == the susceptibility of bovine udder quarters colonized with corynebacterium bovis  to experimental infection with staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == twenty bovine udder quarters colonized with corynebacterium bovis sr6 and 20 uncolonized quarters were challenged by inoculation of staphylococcus aureus newbould 305 (atcc 29740) into the teat cistern. the percentage of infection in quarters colonized with c. bovis (50%) was significantly lower than that in controls (100%). by similar challenge no significant difference was observed between the percentage of infection with streptococcus agalactiae atcc 27956 in 33 quarters colonized with c. bovis (70%) compared to 33 controls (87.9%). a total of 37 quarters colonized with c. bovis and 37 control quarters were challenged with staph. aureus newbould 305 (atcc 29740) and maxi (atcc 27543) and strep. agalactiae (atcc 27956) by exposure of the teat orifice. the percentage of teat ducts colonized with c. bovis which became infected with either pathogen was not different from that for controls.

TI  == relationship between the level of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) in bovine milk and the presence of mastitis pathogens.
AB  == changes in the level of the tissue damage marker enzyme, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) in quarter fore milks were found to be related to the presence and types of pathogenic bacteria present and to somatic cell counts (scc). minor pathogens (coagulase-negative staphylococci, corynebacterium bovis) elicited a mild scc increase (from a mean of 243 x 10(3)/ml in healthy quarters to 504 x 10(3)/ml in infected quarters) with marginal tissue damage (mean nagase activity increased from 21 in healthy quarters to 28 in infected quarters). major pathogens (i.e. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, str. dysgalactiae and str. uberis) caused more  severe tissue damage (mean nagase of 48) and scc increases (mean, 2803 x 10(3)/ml). the nagase test could also be used effectively on composite milk samples where regular monthly nagase analysis was able to identify correctly 74%  of animals having infected quarters. the possibility of combining scc and nagase  data in order to give a more definite diagnosis of bovine mastitis is discussed.

TI  == humoral reactions in human endocarditis due to streptococcus bovis: evidence for  a common s bovis antigen.
AB  == humoral reactions to native culture filtrates of streptococcus bovis were studied in patients with endocarditis by means of two-dimensional crossed immunoelectrophoresis. serum from patients with s bovis endocarditis produced eight different precipitin arcs. lex antigen cross-reacted with sera from patients with viridans streptococcal endocarditis, and ta antigen cross-reacted with ribitol teichoic acid-positive sera from patients with staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. one antigen, common (c), was immunoreactive with all 10 sera from s bovis-infected patients. antibody to this antigen was not found in sera from 77 patients with gram-positive bacteremia or in 29 other control sera. common (c) antigen was found in all strains of s bovis isolated from patients. rabbits immunized with formalinized s bovis cells of human origin also produced antibody  to common (c) antigen. common (c) may be an important antigen of s bovis and may  in fact define this organism serologically.

TI  == germicidal teat dip in a herd with low prevalence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus mastitis.
AB  == effectiveness of an iodophor teat dip in reducing new intramammary infection and  clinical mastitis was tested in a herd free of streptococcus agalactiae and with  a low prevalence of staphylococcus aureus infections. in this 6-mo study with an  average of 152 lactating cows on trial on sampling dates, right rear and left front teats were dipped after each milking while right front and left rear teats  were undipped controls. teat dipping significantly reduced new infections by staphylococcus aureus, streptococci (other than streptococcus agalactiae), coagulase-negative staphylococci, and corynebacterium bovis and reduced clinical  cases caused by infections established during the trial. however, the dip did not reduce new infections or clinical mastitis caused by coliform bacteria. therefore, use of a germicidal dip is recommended for herds with a low prevalence of streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus, but the practice should not be expected to control coliform mastitis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == the in vitro activity of norfloxacin (mk366) against 477 aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates was compared to that of nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, cephalexin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and the combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. norfloxacin was more active than the other agents against all gram-negative organisms tested. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of pseudomonas aeruginosa were less than or equal to 0.125-32 mg/l with 90% inhibited (mic90) by 4 mg/l; mics of the enterobacteriaceae including serratia marcescens were less than or equal to 0.125-8 mg/l with an mic90 of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. there was also excellent activity against the gram-positive cocci including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and the enterococci, with mics less than or equal to 0.125-4 mg/l and an mic90 less than  or equal to 4 mg/l. only 8 of 477 organisms were norfloxacin-resistant (mic greater than or equal to 16 mg/l): 3 of 100 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 of 10 pseudomonas maltophilia and 2 of 15 streptococcus bovis strains. in contrast, 97% of the gram-positive cocci and 49% of the gram-negative bacilli were nalidixic acid-resistant (mic greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). norfloxacin shows excellent activity against a wide range of bacteria and merits further study as a urinary antibacterial agent.

TI  == within herd comparison of teat dipping and dry cow therapy with only selective dry cow therapy in six herds.
AB  == a within herd comparison of teat dipping and dry cow therapy (full treatment) with only selective dry cow therapy (partial treatment) was carried out in six commercial dairy herds for a two year period. in four herds, the incidence of clinical mastitis was 2 to 12 per cent higher in the partial treatment group. in  another herd, in which the pattern of clinical mastitis isolates was unusual in that minor pathogens were isolated from 30 per cent of mastitis cases, the incidence was 43 per cent higher in the partial treatment group. in the remaining herd the incidence was 10 percent higher in the full treatment group. streptococcus uberis mastitis was more common in the partial treatment groups of  five herds; coliform mastitis was more common in the full treatment groups of two herds and similar in both groups in the other herds. high rates of coliform mastitis were associated with poor herd environmental conditions but this was not true for strep uberis mastitis. rates of staphylococcus aureus and strep dysgalactiae mastitis were low in all herds. the level of major pathogen infection in cows completing the trial in all herds increased in the partial treatment group from 5 per cent of quarters at the start to 12 per cent at the finish of the trial. in the full treatment group, however, there was only a small increase in this level. in contrast, levels of corynebacterium bovis infection increased by 17 per cent in both treatment groups. continued use of teat dipping  and dry cow therapy was associated with a higher rate of coliform mastitis in two of the three herds where there were poor standards of hygiene and husbandry.

TI  == cephapirin therapy in infective endocarditis.
AB  == ten patients, eight of them heroin addicts, with infective endocarditis were treated with cephapirin. causative organisms included staphylococcus aureus in six patients and viridans streptococci, s bovis, and s pneumoniae in one patient  each. in one of the patients with endocarditis, both s aureus and an organism of  the beta-streptococcus group were simultaneously isolated. all patients except two, both with monomicrobial s aureus endocarditis, were cured. all isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml of cephapirin. peak serum bactericidal activity greater than or equal to 32 times the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of the causative organism was achieved in all cases after giving 2 gm iv every four hours. after using large inoculums of staphylococci for in vitro tests, we found that twofold to eightfold increases in mic occurred. cephapirin was well tolerated intravenously and high levels in serum were achieved without toxicity or accumulation of the drug.

TI  == detection and partial characterization of antibacterial factor(s) in alveolar lining material of rats.
AB  == intracellular killing of staphylococcus aureus by alveolar macrophages is known to be enhanced by exposure to alveolar lining material. because this material may have a role in pulmonary host defenses, we have studied its effect on pneumococci and other nonstaphylococcal organisms. alveolar lining material from rats caused  rapid killing and lysis of pneumococci. the antipneumococcal activity was localized to the surfactant-containing fraction of the fluid and was not affected by trypsin. phospholipid extracts of the surfactant fraction or purified lamellar bodies killed pneumococci. lysis of pneumococci by the surfactant fraction appeared to be mediated by a detergent-like activation of pneumococcal autolysin, in that bacteriolysis was prevented by substitution of ethanolamine for choline in pneumococcal cell walls, and a pneumococcal transformant that lacked autolysin was not lysed. the surfactant fraction readily killed pneumococci containing ethanolamine or the autolysin-defective transformant, and studies with tritiated  methyl-d-glucose loading and release showed that killing was associated with increased bacterial cell membrane permeability. bactericidal activity (without lysis) was observed with several nonpneumococcal gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus viridans, unspeciated respiratory streptococci, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and bacillus species. purified diacylphospholipids had no antibacterial activity, however, a lysophospholipid, palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine, had many properties resembling the surfactant-containing fraction of lavage, including autolysin-mediated pneumococcal lysis, altered cell membrane permeability, and antibacterial activity against several gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == dynamics of nonclinical bovine intramammary infections with major and minor pathogens.
AB  == udder infections were recorded in 3 herds throughout a lactation period with bacteriologic examination being done at 3-week intervals. new infection rates and levels of infection at calving differed significantly (p less than 0.001) between herds, but persistence of infection did not. of the 324 infections, 80.5% lasted  up to drying off. of quarters infected with major pathogens, 16.8% eliminated their infection (63% became reinfected); 20.8% of quarters infected with minor pathogens eliminated their infection (43% became reinfected). significant differences in persistence of infections, quarter clearing rate (defined as the rate at which infected quarters become and remain noninfected) and ability to give way to and to take place of a preexistent infection, did not occur between corynebacterium bovis and major pathogens. though 66% of coagulase-negative staphylococci infections persisted up to drying off, they disappeared more frequently (p less than 0.01).

TI  == the antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. stable l-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial l-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). streptococcus  pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus bovis, viridans group streptococcus, enterococcus, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species, and lactobacillus species. antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against s. aureus, s. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans streptococcus. the combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against s. aureus.

TI  == mannitol agar for microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis.
AB  == a medium containing mannitol (mannitol agar) was developed and evaluated as a tool for the microbiologic diagnosis of bovine mastitis. mannitol agar supported  growth of all important bacterial mastitis pathogens (staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, and pseudomonads) except corynebacterium pyogenes. color change around colonies in the agar permitted the differentiation of pathogenic from nonpathogenic staphylococci. most staphylococcus aureus strains and some staphylococcus epidermidis strains produced yellow zones. these yellow zone-producing strains (mannitol fermenters) of staphylococci were obtained from  quarters with significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) somatic cell counts (scc) in the milk, as compared with uninfected quarters and, therefore, would be considered pathogens. mannitol-negative strains of s epidermidis (those with red  zones) were obtained from quarters with scc similar to those of uninfected quarters. the streptococci could be divided into 2 groups on the basis of color change around the colonies: streptococcus agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, and group g streptococci produced red zones; str uberis, str bovis, and enterococci produced yellow zones. pathogenic streptococci (str agalactiae, str dysgalactiae, str uberis, and group g streptococci) were obtained from quarters with scc significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than those of uninfected quarters. streptococcus bovis and enterococci were obtained from quarters with scc similar  to those of uninfected quarters and were considered nonpathogenic. pathogenic streptococci were found in much higher concentration than nonpathogenic streptococci and could be differentiated on that basis.

AB  == cultures of staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and streptococcus bovis were incubated on membrane filters on agar containing antibiotics at one-third to one-fourth the minimal inhibitory concentration for the particular bacterial strain. s. aureus was grown in the presence of oxacillin, cephaloridine, or lincomycin. n. gonorrhoeae and s. bovis were grown in the presence of penicillin. the membranes were then incubated in drug-free agar, after which viability was determined and the cells were examined by electron microscopy. s. aureus exposed  to oxacillin and cephaloridine grew into cells two to seven times larger than normal that contained thick multiple cross walls. s. aureus exposed to lincomycin grew into cells 1.5 to 2 times larger than normal, with multiple thick cross walls and periheral cell walls twice the normal thickness. n. gonorrhoeae cells exposed to penicillin were slightly larger than normal and had cross walls that were up to eight times thicker than normal. after transfer to drug-free agar, cells became smaller, and some normal organisms could be seen. s. bovis incubated in the presence of penicillin grew into filaments that contained no cross walls.  two hours after the return to drug-free agar, filaments with cross walls as well  as normal cells were observed. exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin did not affect the growth of the peripheral cell wall of s. aureus, n. gonorrhoeae, or s. bovis, but appeared to inhibit lysis of cross walls in s. aureus and n. gonorrhoeae and to inhibit the synthesis of cross walls in s. bovis; that is, the rates of peripheral and cross wall formation differed in their susceptibility to penicillin. these facts suggest that peripheral growth and cross wall formation in cocci are separable processes.
