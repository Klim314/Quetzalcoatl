TI  == polysaccharide from seeds of plantago asiatica l. affects lipid metabolism and colon microbiota of mouse.
AB  == polysaccharide from the seeds of plantago asiatica l. was given via oral administration to mice (0.4 g/kg body weight, 30 days) to observe its effects on  mouse nutrient metabolism and colon microbiota. it was found the polysaccharide intake could lower the apparent absorption of lipid. total triglyceride, cholesterol, and atherogenic index in blood serum with total lipid and cholesterol levels in liver of polysaccharide group mice were all significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). furthermore, the effect of the  polysaccharide intake on mouse colon bacterial communities was investigated. mice from the polysaccharide group showed a higher colon bacterial diversity than the  control group. bacteroides sp., eubacterium sp., butyrate-producing bacteria butyrivibrio sp., and probiotics bifidobacterium bifidum , lactobacillus fermentum , and lactobacillus reuteri in mouse colon were all increased after polysaccharide intake. these indicated that the intake of polysaccharide from p.  asiatica l. could be beneficial for lipid metabolism and colon microbiota.

TI  == stimulation of butyrate production by gluconic acid in batch culture of pig cecal digesta and identification of butyrate-producing bacteria.
AB  == gluconic acid reaches the large intestine to stimulate lactic acid bacteria. however, the fermentation pattern of gluconic acid has yet to be elucidated. accordingly, we examined the fermentation properties induced by gluconic acid in  the pig cecal digesta in vitro. we also tested sorbitol and glucose, substrates for which the fermentation rate and patterns are known. the gluconic acid-utilizing bacteria were further isolated from pig cecal digesta and identified to examine the effect of gluconic acid on hind gut fermentation. gluconic acid was fermented more slowly than were the other two substrates. gluconic acid stimulated butyrate production; the butyrate molar percentage reached 26%, which is considered a high butyrate production. the majority of gluconic acid fermenters were identified as lactic acid bacteria, such as lactobacillus reuteri and l. mucosae, and acid-utilizing bacteria, such as megasphaera elsdenii and mitsuokella multiacida. the gluconic acid fermented by lactic acid bacteria, and the lactate and acetate that were produced were used to form butyrate by acid-utilizing bacteria, such as m. elsdenii. gluconic acid may  be useful as a prebiotic to stimulate butyrate production in the large intestine.
