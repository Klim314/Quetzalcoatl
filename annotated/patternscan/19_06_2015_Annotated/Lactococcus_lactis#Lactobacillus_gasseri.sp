TI  == food preservative potential of gassericin a-containing concentrate prepared from  a cheese whey culture supernatant from lactobacillus gasseri la39.
AB  == gassericin a (ga) is a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39. in this study, ga-containing concentrate was prepared using a cross-flow membrane filtration device (30 kda cut-off) from the culture supernatant of lb. gasseri la39 cultivated in a cheese whey-based food-grade medium. the bacteriocin activity titer in the concentrate was 16 times as high as that of the culture supernatant and was completely maintained through each incubation at 4 degrees c  for 3 months, 37 degrees c for 2 months, 60 degrees c for 5 h, and 100 degrees c  for 30 min. the ga-containing concentrate was used with glycine powder to make custard creams, and then four representative strains of custard cream spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, achromobacter denitrificans and pseudomonas fluorescens) were individually inoculated at c. 10(3) colony forming units/g in the custard creams. throughout 30 days of incubation at 30 degrees c, all of the inoculated bacteria were completely inhibited by the combination of 5% (w/w) of the ga-containing concentrate and 0.5% (w/w) glycine. this is the first highly practical application of ga to foods as a biopreservative, and the concentration method and the bacteriocin concentrate would contribute to biopreservation of several foods.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == effects of gassericins a and t, bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus gasseri, with glycine on custard cream preservation.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri la39 and la158 isolated from human-infant feces produce bacteriocins named gassericins a and t, respectively. both gassericins have high  heat stability (121 degrees c, 10 min), good ph tolerance (ph 2-11), and strong bactericidality against many gram-positive bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria, and thus are expected to be effective food preservatives. a microwell plate assay against 12 strains of custard cream spoilage bacteria showed that the gassericins had broader antibacterial spectra than nisin a. although the gassericins allowed gram-negative isolates to grow, they successfully inhibited the growth of all tested bacterial strains in microwells with the addition of glycine. glycine was bacteriostatic against many strains except lactic acid bacteria. for practical use, gassericin a was efficiently produced by cultivation in a food-grade medium improved using cheese whey, nourishing proteose peptone, and surfactant yolk lecithin. the practical preservative effect of gassericin a and glycine was verified from the viability of 4 isolated strains, bacillus cereus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, achromobacter denitrificans, and pseudomonas fluorescens, in custard creams. custard cream containing 123 arbitrary units of gassericin a per milliliter entirely growth-inhibited the 2 gram-positive strains. in custard cream containing an insufficient amount of gassericin a (49 arbitrary units/ml), the gram-positive strains gradually grew but were completely inhibited by the addition of 0.5% (wt/wt) glycine. the 2 gram-negative strains did not multiply even in the additive-free custard cream, probably because of the unsuitable growth environment. this is the first report showing the combined effect of bacteriocin and glycine and their application for  food preservation, which may be helpful for future use in the food industry.

TI  == dna sequencing and homologous expression of a small peptide conferring immunity to gassericin a, a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39.
AB  == gassericin a, produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, is a hydrophobic circular bacteriocin. the dna region surrounding the gassericin a structural gene, gaaa, was sequenced, and seven open reading frames (orfs) of 3.5 kbp (gaabcadite) were  found with possible functions in gassericin a production, secretion, and immunity. the deduced products of the five consecutive orfs gaaadite have homology to those of genes involved in butyrivibriocin ar10 production, although  the genetic arrangements are different in the two circular bacteriocin genes. gaai is a small, positively charged hydrophobic peptide of 53 amino acids containing a putative transmembrane segment. heterologous expression and homologous expression of gaai in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363 and l. gasseri jcm1131(t), respectively, were studied. gaai-expressing strains exhibited at least sevenfold-higher resistance to gassericin a than corresponding control strains, indicating that gaai encodes an immunity peptide for gassericin a. comparison of gaai to peptides with similar characteristics found in the circular bacteriocin gene loci is discussed.

TI  == complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid plca36 isolated from lactobacillus casei  zhang.
AB  == the complete 36,487 bp sequence of plasmid plca36 from lactobacillus casei zhang  was determined. plca36 contains 44 predicted coding regions, and to 23 of them functions could be assigned. for the first time, we identified a relbe toxin-antitoxin (ta) locus in a lactobacillus genus, perhaps indicating a potential role for plca36 in host survival under extreme nutritional stress. a region encoding a cluster of conjugation genes (tra) was also identified. the cluster showed high similarity and co-linearity with tra regions of pwcfs103 and  pmrc01 from lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis, respectively. comparative gene analysis revealed that plasmids from the genus lactobacillus may have contributed to the environmental adaptation mainly by providing carbohydrate and amino acid transporters. in addition, two chromosome-encoded relbe systems in lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri were identified.

TI  == extracellular secretion of a maltogenic amylase from lactobacillus gasseri atcc33323 in lactococcus lactis mg1363 and its application on the production of branched maltooligosaccharides.
AB  == a maltogenic amylase gene from lactobacillus gasseri atcc33323 (lgma) was expressed in lactococcus lactis mg1363 using the p170 expression system. the successful production of recombinant lgma (rlgma) was confirmed by the catalytic  activity of the enzyme in liquid and solid media. the n-terminal amino acid sequencing analysis of the rlgma showed that it was met-gln-leu-ala-ala-leu-, which was the same as that of genuine protein, meaning the signal peptide was efficiently cleaved during secretion to the extracellular milieu. the optimal reaction temperature and ph of rlgma (55 degrees c and ph 5, respectively) and enzymatic hydrolysis patterns on various substrates (beta-cyclodextrin, starch, and pullulan) supported that rlgma was not only efficiently secreted from the lactococcus lactis mg1363 but was also functionally active. finally, the branched maltooligosaccharides were effectively produced from liquefied corn starch, by using rlgma secreted from lactococcus lactis, with a yield of 53.1%.

TI  == mutational and biochemical analyses of the endolysin lys(gay) encoded by the lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131t phage phi gay.
AB  == the lys(gay) of lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131(t) phage phigay endolysin was purified to homogeneity using the escherichia coli/his.tag system. zymographic and spectrophotometric assays showed that lys(gay) lysed over 20 heated gram-positive bacterial species as the substrates, including lactobacilli, lactococci, enterococci, micrococci, and staphylococci. the enzymatic activity had the ph and temperature optima of about 6.5 and 37 degrees c, respectively. amino-acid substitution analysis revealed that 13 residues of lys(gay) were involved in cell-lytic activity: in the beta/alpha(gay) domain, g10, d12, e33, d36, h60, y61, d96, e98, v124, l132, and d198; in the sh3b(gay) domain, y272 and  w284. in addition, deletion analysis demonstrated that the beta/alpha(gay) domain of n-terminal 216 residues is the core enzyme portion, although the cell-lytic ability is lower than that of lys(gay). these mutational experiments suggested that beta/alpha(gay) (in which two acidic residues of d12 and e98 likely act as catalytic residues) is responsible for cell-lytic activity, and sh3b(gay) promotes beta/alpha(gay) possibly through cell-wall binding function. the purified his-tagged sh3b(gay) domain containing 94 residues from s217 to k310 (i) bound to gram-positive bacteria susceptible to lys(gay), (ii) induced aggregation of exponentially growing cells of l. gasseri jcm 1131(t), l. casei iam 1045, lactococcus lactis c2, l. lactis mg 1363, and enterococcus hirae iam 1262 by forming thread-like chained cells, (iii) inhibited lytic activity of lys(gay), and (iv) impeded autolysis of l. gasseri jcm 1131(t) in buffer systems. a truncated protein hdeltash3b(gay) lacking in n-terminal 21 residues (from s217 to e237) of sh3b(gay) and an amino-acid substituted protein hsh3b(gay)g (w284g) lost the activities of hsh3b(gay), showing that the n-terminal region and w284 probably play important roles in the sh3b(gay) function(s).

TI  == identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140: identification of the atp (atpbefhagdc) operon  and analysis of its genetic structure, characteristics, and phylogeny.
AB  == the atp operon is highly conserved among eubacteria, and it has been considered a molecular marker as an alternative to the 16s rrna gene. pcr primers were designed from the consensus sequences of the atpd gene to amplify partial atpd sequences from 12 bifidobacterium species and nine lactobacillus species. all pcr products were sequenced and aligned with other atpd sequences retrieved from public databases. genes encoding the subunits of the f(1)f(0)-atpase of bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140 (atpbefhagdc) were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences of these subunits showed significant homology with the sequences of other organisms. we identified specific sequence signatures for  the genus bifidobacterium and for the closely related taxa bifidobacterium lactis and bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii, which could provide an alternative to current methods for identification of lactic acid bacterial species. northern blot analysis showed that there was a transcript at approximately 7.3 kb, which corresponded to the size of the atp operon, and a transcript at 4.5 kb, which corresponded to the atpc, atpd, atpg, and atpa genes. the transcription initiation sites of these two mrnas were mapped by primer extension, and the results revealed no consensus promoter sequences. phylogenetic analysis of the atpd genes demonstrated that the lactobacillus atpd gene clustered with the genera listeria, lactococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus and that the higher g+c content and highly biased codon usage with respect to the genome average support the hypothesis that there  was probably horizontal gene transfer. the acid inducibility of the atp operon of b. lactis dsm 10140 was verified by slot blot hybridization by using rna isolated from acid-treated cultures of b. lactis dsm 10140. the rapid increase in the level of atp operon transcripts upon exposure to low ph suggested that the atpase complex of b. lactis dsm 10140 was regulated at the level of transcription and not at the enzyme assembly step.

TI  == new thermosensitive delivery vector and its use to enable nisin-controlled gene expression in lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  == derivatives of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus curvatus showed temperature-sensitive replication in thermophilic lactobacilli. the thermosensitive replicon was used to construct the new delivery vector ptn1, which allows site-specific replacement of chromosomal dna sequences. ptn1 carries an erythromycin resistance marker suitable for selection of single-copy integrants and replicates readily at 35 degrees c, whereas replication is efficiently shut down at 42 degrees c. to demonstrate the functionality of ptn1,  the signal transduction genes (nisrk) of the nisin-controlled expression system were integrated downstream of the pepn gene into the chromosome of lactobacillus  gasseri. in the resulting strain, uklbg1, expression of nisrk was likely driven by cotranscription with pepn and enabled nisin-dependent induction of a fusion of a reporter gene (pepi) to the nisa promoter. the induction rates were correlated  with the amount of nisin used, and maximum pepi expression was achieved with nisin concentrations (above 25 ng/ml) at which growth of the bacteria was already inhibited.

TI  == comparative genomics of the late gene cluster from lactobacillus phages.
AB  == three prophage sequences were identified in the lactobacillus johnsoni strain ncc533. prophage lj965 predicted a gene map very similar to those of pac-site streptococcus thermophilus phages over its dna packaging and head and tail morphogenesis modules. sequence similarity linked the putative dna packaging and  head morphogenesis genes at the protein level. prophage lj965/s. thermophilus phage sfi11/lactococcus lactis phage tp901-1 on one hand and lactobacillus delbrueckii phage ll-h/lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e/listeria monocytogenes phage a118 on the other hand defined two sublines of structural gene clusters in pac-site siphoviridae from low-gc gram-positive bacteria. bacillus subtilis phage spp1 linked both sublines. the putative major head and tail proteins from lj965 shared weak sequence similarity with phages from gram-negative bacteria. a clearly independent line of structural genes in siphoviridae from low-gc gram-positive bacteria is defined by temperate cos-site  phages including lactobacillus gasseri phage adh, which also shared sequence similarity with phage d3 infecting a gram-negative bacterium. a phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the clpp-like protein identified in four cos-site siphoviridae from lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and pseudomonas showed graded sequence relationships. the tree suggested that the clpp-like proteins from the phages were not acquired by horizontal gene transfer from their corresponding bacterial hosts.

AB  == endoglucanase a from clostridium thermocellum resistant to pancreatic proteinase  was selected out of a range of microbial cellulases expressed in lactobacilli. two lactobacillus-e. coli expression vectors, harboring the endoglucanase gene from c. thermocellum under the control of its own promoter (psd1) and the lactococcus lactis lac a promoter (psd2), were constructed separately. intestinal lactobacillus strains, l. gasseri and l. johnsonii, were electrotransformed with  psd1 and psd2, and the stability of each plasmid was evaluated. the endoglucanase activities of 0.722 and 0.759 u/ml were respectively found in culture medium of l. gasseri and l. johnsonii containing psd1, and of 0.407 u/ml in medium of l. gasseri harboring psd2. when the probiotic characteristics such as acid-tolerance, bile-salt tolerance, and antibiotic susceptibility were investigated, l. gasseri and l. johnsonii were resistant to low phs of 2 and 3. also, l. johnsonii was bile-salt resistant in the presence of 0.5% oxgall and porcine bile extract. l. johnsonii and l. gasseri showed a rather homogeneous resistant pattern against tested antibiotics. both strains were resistant to amikacin, bacitracin, gentamicin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and colistin.

TI  == primary structure and features of the genome of the lactobacillus gasseri temperate bacteriophage (phi)adh.
AB  == the complete dna sequence of the lactobacillus (lb.) gasseri temperate phage (phi)adh was determined. the linear and double-stranded genome consists of 43.785bp with a g+c content of 35. 3% and 3' protruding cohesive ends of 12nt. sixty-two possible orfs were identified. on the basis of homology comparisons, some of them could be assigned to possible functions, such as a helicase, a nucleic acid polymerase and a protease. in a non-coding area of the (phi)adh genome, structural features of a potential replication origin were detected. after subcloning, this region was functional as a replicon in lb. gasseri and lactococcus lactis. n-terminal aa sequencing and electron microscopic analysis of intact and defective phage particles enabled the identification of two capsid protein genes. one of their products, the major head protein, seems to be processed on the posttranslational level.

TI  == the expression signals of the lactobacillus brevis slpa gene direct efficient heterologous protein production in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a cassette based on the expression signals of the lactobacillus brevis surface (s)-layer protein gene (slpa) was constructed. the low-copy-number vector pkth2095, derived from pgk12, was used as the cloning vector. the efficiency of slpa promoters in intracellular protein production was studied using three reporter genes, beta-glucuronidase (gusa), luciferase (luc) and aminopeptidase n  (pepn) in three different lactic acid bacteria hosts: lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus gasseri. the s-layer promoters were recognized in each strain and especially l. lactis and lb. plantarum exhibited high levels of transcripts. the production kinetics of reporter proteins was studied as a function of growth. the gusa, luc and pepn activities varied considerably among the lactic acid bacterial strains studied. the highest levels  of beta-glucuronidase and luciferase activity were obtained in l. lactis. the level of gusa obtained in l. lactis corresponded to over 15% of the total cellular proteins. the highest level of aminopeptidase n activity was achieved in lb. plantarum where pepn corresponded up to 28% of the total cellular proteins at the late exponential phase of growth. this level of pepn activity is 30-fold higher than that in lb. helveticus, which is the species from which the pepn gene originates.

TI  == structure of a genome region of the lactobacillus gasseri temperate phage phiadh  covering a repressor gene and cognate promoters.
AB  == by sequencing the dna regions which flank the intg gene encoding integrase of the temperate lactobacillus (lb.) gasseri bacteriophage phiadh, a continuous sequence of 6590 bp was established. it encompasses five newly identified orfs, of which four are located upstream, and one (orfc) downstream of intg. proteins corresponding to the expected products of the intg upstream coding regions, orfa  (33 kda), orf2 (14 kda), rad (12.1 kda), and tec (7.9 kda), were identified by in vitro expression of subcloned dna fragments. rad shares homology with transcription regulators, including sinr of bacillus species and the repressor of phage phi105. the gporf2 is similar to predicted products of topologically equivalent coding regions of the lactococcus lactis phage tp901-1 and the b. subtilis phage phi105. promoters for the divergently oriented rad and tec genes were mapped within the 435-bp region between them and specify overlapping transcripts with extended 5'-untranslated sequences. as shown with lacz fusions,  rad repressed transcription from the tec and rad promoters 20- and 5-fold, respectively. in lb. gasseri, weak expression of cloned rad ws sufficient to mediate immunity towards phiadh.

TI  == high level heterologous protein production in lactococcus and lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the lactobacillus brevis s-layer signals.
AB  == a secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a s-layer  protein (slpa) from lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. e. coli beta-lactamase (bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the s-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in lactococcus lactis,  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pgk12. in all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpa signals and all bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. the lb. brevis s-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in l. lactis, lb. brevis and lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. gasseri the slpa promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. the production of bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. the highest yield of bla was obtained with l. lactis and lb. brevis. without ph control, substantial degradation of bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (lab) tested. when growing l. lactis and lb. brevis under ph control, the bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. l. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of bla which to our knowledge  represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by lab so far. the short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) bla molecules/cell per h. such a high rate was also observed with lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpa gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of bla  production. the results obtained indicate wide applicability of the lb. brevis slpa signals for efficient protein production and secretion in lab.

TI  == cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of the genes encoding lytic functions  of bacteriophage phi g1e.
AB  == the lysis genes of a lactobacillus phage phi g1e were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli. nucleotide sequencing of a 3813-bp phi g1e dna revealed five successive open reading frames (orf), rorf50, rorf118, hol, and lys and rorf175, in the same dna strand. by comparative analysis of the dna sequence, the putative hol product (holin) has an estimated molecular weight is 14.2 kda, and contains two potential transmembrane helices and highly charged n- and c-termini, resembling predicted holins (which are thought to be a cytoplasmic membrane-disrupting protein) encoded by other phages such as mv1 from lactobacillus bulgaricus, phi adh from lactobacillus gasseri, as well as monocins from listeria. on the other hand, the putative phi g1e lys product (lysin) of 48.4 kda shows significant similarity with presumed muramidase, known as a cell wall peptidoglycandegrading enzyme, encoded by the lactobacillus phage mv1 and phi adh, the lactococcus lactis phage phi lc3, and the streptococcus pneumoniae phages cp-1, cp-7 and cp-9. when expressed in e. coli, the phi g1e lysin and/or holin decreased the cell turbidity significantly, suggesting that the phi g1e hol-lys system is involved in cytolytic process.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

TI  == primary structure and functional analysis of the lysis genes of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phi adh.
AB  == the lysis genes of the lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phi adh were isolated  by complementation of a lambda sam mutation in escherichia coli. nucleotide sequencing of a 1,735-bp dna fragment revealed two adjacent coding regions of 342 bp (hol) and 951 bp (lys) in the same reading frame which appear to belong to a common transcriptional unit. proteins corresponding to the predicted gene products, holin (12.9 kda) and lysin (34.7 kda), were identified by in vitro and  in vivo expression of the cloned genes. the phi adh holin is a membrane-bound protein with structural similarity to lysis proteins of other phage, known to be  required for the transit of murein hydrolases through the cytoplasmic membrane. the phi adh lysin shows homology with mureinolytic enzymes encoded by the lactobacillus bulgaricus phage mv4, the streptococcus pneumoniae phage cp-1, cp-7, and cp-9, and the lactococcus lactis phage phi lc3. significant homology with the n termini of known muramidases suggests that phi adh lysin acts by a similar catalytic mechanism. in e. coli, the phi adh lysin seems to be associated with the total membrane fraction, from which it can be extracted with lauryl sarcosinate. either one of the phi adh lysis proteins provoked lysis of e. coli when expressed along with holins or lysins of phage lambda or bacillus subtilis phage phi 29. concomitant expression of the combined holin and lysin functions of phi adh in e. coli, however, did not result in efficient cell lysis.

AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == cloning and expression of the manganese superoxide dismutase gene of escherichia  coli in lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  == the escherichia coli soda gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme mn-containing superoxide dismutase (mnsod), was cloned in the expression vector pmg36e. this vector has a multiple cloning site downstream of a promoter and shine-dalgarno sequences derived from lactococcus. the protein-coding region of soda from e. coli was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using a thermocycler and taq dna polymerase before cloning into pmg36e. when introduced into e. coli, the recombinant plasmid expressed the predicted fusion protein, both in the presence  and absence of oxygen. the expression of the fusion protein in e. coli was verified by sod assays, activity gels and western blots. the recombinant plasmid  was also introduced into lactococcus lactis, which contains a resident sod, and into lactobacillus gasseri, which is devoid of sod. transformed lactococci expressed an active soda fusion protein plus an active hybrid protein composed of subunits of the lactococcus and the recombinant e. coli enzymes. transformants of l. gasseri expressed only the fusion soda protein, which was enzymatically active.
