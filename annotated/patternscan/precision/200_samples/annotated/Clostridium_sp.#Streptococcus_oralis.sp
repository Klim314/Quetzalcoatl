TI == anaerobic osteomyelitis in children.
AB == twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. the etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. the predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), bacteroides sp. (21), fusobacterium sp. (8), streptococcus sp. (5) and clostridium sp. (4). the organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. these included all isolates of the bacteroides fragilis (4) and of staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 bacteroides oralis. the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.

TI == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients. anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
