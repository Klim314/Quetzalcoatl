TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - Cation and sugar selectivity determinants in a novel family of transport proteins.
AB  - A new family of homologous membrane proteins that transport galactosides-pentoses-hexuronides (GPH) is described. By analysing the aligned amino acid sequences of the GPH family, and by exploiting their different specificities for cations and sugars, we have designed mutations that yield novel insights into the nature of ligand binding sites in membrane proteins. Mutants have been isolated/constructed in the melibiose transport proteins of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium, and the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus which facilitate uncoupled transport or have an altered cation and/or substrate specificity. Most of the mutations map in the amino-terminal region, in or near amphipathic alpha-helices II and IV, or in interhelix-loop 10-11 of the transport proteins. On the basis of the kinetic properties of these mutants, and the primary and secondary structure analyses presented here, we speculate on the cation binding pocket of this family of transporters. The regulation of the transporters through interaction with, or phosphorylation by, components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system is also discussed.
TI  - Analysis of the lacZ sequences from two Streptococcus thermophilus strains: comparison with the Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus bulgaricus beta-galactosidase sequences.
AB  - The lacZ gene from Streptococcus thermophilus A054, a commercial yogurt strain, was cloned on a 7.2 kb PstI fragment in Escherichia coli and compared with the previously cloned lacZ gene from S. thermophilus ATCC 19258. Using the dideoxy chain termination method, the DNA sequences of both lacZ structural genes were determined and found to be 3071 bp in length. When the two sequences were more closely analysed, 21 nucleotide differences were detected, of which only nine resulted in amino acid changes in the proteins, the remainder occurring in wobble positions of the respective codons. Only three bases separated the termination codon for the lacS gene from the initiation codon for lacZ, suggesting that the lactose utilization genes are organized as an operon. The amino acid sequence of the beta-galactosidase, derived from the DNA sequence, corresponds to a protein with a molecular mass of 116860 Da. Comparison of the S. thermophilus amino acid sequences with those from Lactobacillus bulgaricus, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed 48, 35 and 32.5% identity respectively. Although little sequence homology was observed at the DNA level, many regions conserved in the amino acid sequence were identified when the beta-galactosidase proteins from S. thermophilus, E. coli and L. bulgaricus were compared.
