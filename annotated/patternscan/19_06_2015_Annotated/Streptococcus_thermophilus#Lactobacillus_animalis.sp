TI  == randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of synbiotic yogurt effect on  the health of children.
AB  == objective: to assess the effects of daily consumption of a synbiotic yogurt drink on the health, growth, and quality of life of healthy children 12-48 months of age in out-of-home child care. study design: healthy children attending child care centers were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. the intervention was a yogurt drink containing streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis (bb-12) (5 x 10(9) cfu/100 ml serving), and 1 g of inulin (synbiotic group) vs a similar nonsynbiotic-containing acidified milk drink (placebo group)  once daily for 16 weeks. the end points were days of diarrhea, fever, vomiting, symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, use of antibiotics, physician visits, child care absenteeism, parental work absenteeism, and quality of life (pedsql 4.0; mapi research trust, lyon, france). results: compared with placebo (n = 73), children receiving synbiotic (n = 76) had significantly fewer days of reported fever (1.85 vs 1.95, p < .05), significant improvement in social functioning (p < .035; pre-to-end intervention), and school functioning (p < .045; pre-to-mid intervention). more days with >/=3 loose/watery stools were reported in the synbiotic group (p < .05). conclusions: daily supplementation of  children's diet with yogurt containing probiotic bacteria bb-12 and inulin significantly reduced days of fever and improved social and school functioning. the increased frequency of bowel movements may be explained by an accelerating effect of bb-12 and inulin on intestinal transit. further research on the possible benefits of synbiotics on children's health is advised. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov: nct00653705.

TI  == proteolytic and ace-inhibitory activities of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria as affected by different levels of fat, inulin and starter culture.
AB  == in this study, the effects of fat (0.5 %, 3.2 % and 5.0 %), inulin (0.0 and 1.0 %) and starter culture (0.0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 % and 1.5 %) on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria were assessed. proteolytic activities of bacteria were also investigated. yogurts were prepared either using a sole yogurt commercial culture including streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus or bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la5 in addition to yogurt culture. relative degrees of proteolysis were found to be considerably higher in yogurt samples than uht milk as the control. both regular  and probiotic yogurts showed considerable ace-inhibitory activities. results showed that degree of proteolysis was not influenced by different fat contents, while was increased by high concentration of starter culture (1.5 % w/w) and reduced by inulin (1 % w/w). ace-inhibitory activities of yogurt were also negatively affected by the presence of inulin and high levels of fat (5 % w/w). moreover, yogurt containing probiotic bacteria showed higher inhibitory against ace in comparison to the yogurt prepared with non-probiotic strains.

TI  == the effects of probiotics and prebiotics on the fatty acid profile and conjugated linoleic acid content of fermented cow milk.
AB  == the ability of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and bifidobacterium animalis bb12), to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) in association with streptococcus thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus during milk fermentation has been evaluated in this study. pasteurized cow milk and infant formula were used. infant formula was selected for its high linoleic acid content, for being a source of cla and for its prebiotic compounds, e.g. galacto-oligosaccharides. the microorganisms were not able to increase the cla content of the fermented products under the given experimental conditions. no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) occurred between the cla content in milk and the fermented samples. the cla contents of 10 commercial fermented milk products were determined. the highest cla content was observed in fermented  milk containing only str. thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == plant extract enhances the viability of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic nonfat yogurt.
AB  == a commercial plant extract (prepared from olive, garlic, onion and citrus extracts with sodium acetate (sa) as a carrier) was evaluated to extend the viability of yogurt starter and probiotic bacteria as a means to enhance the shelf life of live and active culture, probiotic nonfat yogurt. yogurts prepared  from three different formulas (0.5* plant extract, 0.25* sa, or no supplement) and cultures (yogurt starter plus bifidobacterium animalis,lactobacillus acidophilus, or both probiotics) were assessed weekly during 29 days of storage at 5 degrees c. supplemented yogurt mixes had greater buffering capacities than non-supplemented yogurt mixes. at the end of storage, lactobacillus bulgaricus and l. acidophilus counts in supplemented yogurts were greater compared with non-supplemented yogurts. supplementation did not affect streptococcus thermophilus and b. animalis counts. hence the greater buffering capacity of yogurt containing plant extract could enhance the longevity of the probiotics, l. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus, during storage.

TI  == immunoreactivity of lactic acid-treated mare's milk after simulated digestion.
AB  == the similarity of mare's milk to breast milk makes it an interesting substrate for the creation of dairy beverages. the aim of this study was to determine the immunoreactivity of the digested mare's milk products carried out by lactic acid  fermentation with lactobacillus casei lcy, streptococcus thermophilus mk10 and bifidobacterium animalis bi30. simulation of digestion with saliva, pepsin and pancreatin/bile salts was carried out. the immunoreactivity of the milk proteins  was assessed by competitive elisa. the separation of proteins was studied using a tricine sds-page method. it has been demonstrated that lactic acid fermentation significantly decreases the immunoreactivity of beta-lactoglobulin, beta-casein,  kappa-casein and bovine serum albumin. the level of reduction was connected to the type of bacterial strain. the simulated digestion processes caused the decline of immunoreactivity, and the decreases obtained in the experiment were as follows: lactoferrin: 95%, beta-lactoglobulin: 94%, beta-casein: 93%, alpha-lactalbumin: 82%, alpha-casein: 82%, bovine serum albumin: 76% and kappa-casein: 37%. the results of the study indicated that microbial fermentation with tested strains is a valuable method for reducing the immunoreactivity of mare's milk proteins. however, further studies with other bacterial strains are needed to gain a higher level of elimination or total reduction of mare's milk immunoreactivity to possibly introduce fermented mare's milk into the diet of patients with immune-mediated digestive problems.

TI  == short communication: viability of culture organisms in honey-enriched acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type fermented camel milk.
AB  == the aim of this research was to monitor the survival during refrigerated storage  of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in cultured dairy foods made from camel and, for comparison, cow milks supplemented with black locust (robinia pseudoacacia l.) honey and fermented by an acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type culture. two liters of dromedary camel milk and 2 l of cow milk were heated to 90 degrees c and held for 10 min, then cooled to 40 degrees c. one half of both types of milk was fortified with black locust honey at the rate of 5.0% (wt/vol), whereas the other half was devoid of honey and served as a control. the camel and cow milks with and without honey were subsequently inoculated with abt-5 culture and were fermented at 37 degrees c until a ph value of 4.6 was reached. thereafter, the probiotic fermented milks were cooled to 15 degrees c in ice water and were each separated  into 18 fractions that were transferred in sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes. after 24 h of cooling at 8 degrees c (d 0), the samples were stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees c). three tubes of all 4 products (i.e., fermented camel and cow milks with and without honey) were taken at each sampling time (i.e., following 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d of storage), and the counts of characteristic microorganisms and those of certain spoilage microbes (yeasts, molds, coliforms, escherichia coli) were enumerated. the entire experimental program was repeated twice. the results showed that addition of black locust honey at 5% to heat-treated camel and cow milks did not influence the growth and  survival of starter streptococci during production and subsequent refrigerated storage of fermented abt milks. in contrast, honey improved retention of viability of b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 in the camel milk-based product during storage at 4 degrees c up to 5 wk. no spoilage organisms were detected in any of  the samples tested in this study. in conclusion, supplementation of cultured dairy foods, especially those made from camel milk, with honey is recommended because honey is a healthy natural sweetener with a variety of beneficial microbiological, nutritional, and sensory properties.

TI  == effect of green tea supplementation on the microbiological, antioxidant, and sensory properties of probiotic milks.
AB  == green tea and its constituents are known for a wide range of health-promoting properties. they may exert antimicrobial action but without altering lactic acid  bacteria. the aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of green tea addition on the selected properties of probiotic milks. bioyogurts (fermented with abt-1 coculture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12) and acidophilus milks (fermented with pure l. acidophilus la-5 culture) with addition of 0, 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) green tea infusion (gti) were produced and analyzed for the antioxidant capacity by the "diphenyl picrylhydrazyl" (dpph) and "ferric-reducing antioxidant power" (frap) methods, acidity, the count of starter bacteria, and sensory properties at the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 21st day of cold storage. the 15% addition  of gti to the acidophilus milk significantly reduced the lactic acid production during the whole study. the gti had no impact on the level of s. thermophilus and b. lactis bb-12 in bioyogurts, and its effect on the count of l. acidophilus la-5 depended on the concentration and probiotic milk type. gti similarly and in a dose-dependent manner enhanced the antioxidant capacity of both milk types. there were no significant differences between the sensory notes received for bioyogurts, whereas acidophilus milks with tea were less appreciated by the panelists. in conclusion, green tea could be successfully used as a functional additive for selected probiotic milks enhancing their health benefits, but the proper selection of tea additive and starter culture is recommended.

TI  == short communication: survival of the characteristic microbiota in probiotic fermented camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks during refrigerated storage.
AB  == the objective of this study was to monitor the viability during storage of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in probiotic cultured dairy foods made from pasteurized camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks fermented by an abt-type culture. the products manufactured were stored at 4 degrees c for 42d. microbiological analyses were performed at weekly intervals. streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 was the most numerous culture component in all 4 products both at the beginning and at the end of storage. the viable counts of streptococci showed no significant decline in fermented camel milk throughout the entire storage period. the initial numbers of lb. acidophilus la-5 were over 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of strep. thermophilus chcc 742/2130. with the progress of time, a slow and constant decrease was observed in lactobacilli counts; however, the final viability percentages of this organism did not differ  significantly in the probiotic fermented milks tested. the cultured dairy foods made from cow, sheep, and goat milks had comparable b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 counts on d 0, exceeding by approximately 0.5 log10 cycle those in the camel milk-based product. no significant losses occurred in viability of bifidobacteria in fermented camel, cow, and sheep milks during 6wk of refrigerated storage. in conclusion, all 4 varieties of milk proved to be suitable raw materials for the manufacture of abt-type fermented dairy products that were microbiologically safe and beneficial for human consumption. it was suggested that milk from small ruminants be increasingly used to produce probiotic fermented dairy foods. the development of camel milk-based probiotic cultured milks appears to be even more  promising because new markets could thus be conquered. it must be emphasized, however, that further microbiological and sensory studies, technology development activities, and market research are needed before such food products can be successfully commercialized.

TI  == effect of prebiotic carbohydrates on growth, bile survival and cholesterol uptake abilities of dairy-related bacteria.
AB  == background: three strains of lactic acid bacteria and one probiotic bifidobacterium strain sourced from milk origin were considered to select for the best synbiotic-like combination for cholesterol uptake ability. for that purpose, fermentative characteristics, bile salt hydrolase activity, bile survival and cholesterol removal were assessed in the presence of different carbohydrates. results: carbohydrate fermentability was highly variable among the different strains, and lactulose was the only prebiotic to favour growth of all strains, whereas pectin led to low population regardless of the strain. bile survival of bacteria could be improved by the preferred carbon source and was related to their bile salt hydrolase activities. all together, our results showed that the most advantageous synbiotic-like combinations to achieve cholesterol uptake abilities were lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb 340 with raffinose, streptococcus thermophilus ta040 or lactobacillus rhamnosus lbre-lsas with lactulose, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12 with mannitol. conclusion: the suggested synbiotics may represent new promising functional dairy additives.

TI  == incorporation of soybean by-product okara and inulin in a probiotic soy yoghurt:  texture profile and sensory acceptance.
AB  == background: this study evaluated the effect of inulin and okara flour on textural and sensory properties of probiotic soy yoghurt (sy) throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees c. employing a 2(2) design, four formulations of sy produced from soymilk and fermented with an abt-4 culture (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and streptococcus thermophilus) were studied: sy-c (control); sy-i (with inulin); sy-o (with okara); sy-io (with inulin + okara). results: the addition of okara and the refrigerated storage led to significant differences in the instrumental texture parameters of sy (p < 0.05). inulin and okara did not affect sy sensory acceptability (p > 0.05), but there was a tendency for higher scores in the presence of inulin. on the other hand, the storage period, particularly at 21 days, was unfavourable regarding the acceptance of the different sy. conclusion: the results showed that the addition  of okara flour and the storage were significant factors to increase firmness of the soy yoghurts. sy acceptability was not affected by the incorporation of inulin or okara. these results suggest that okara, discarded as industrial waste, may be used in probiotic soy yoghurt, helping to increase the nutritional and functional properties without altering its acceptability.

TI  == impact of inulin and okara on lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium  animalis bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product and probiotic survival under  in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions.
AB  == the effect of inulin and/or okara flour on lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product (fsp) and on  probiotic survival under in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions were investigated throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees c. employing a 2(2) design, four fsp trials were produced from soymilk fermented with abt-4 culture (la-5, bb-12, and streptococcus thermophilus): fsp (control); fsp-i (with inulin, 3 g/100 ml of soymilk); fsp-o (with okara, 5 g/100 ml); fsp-io (with inulin + okara, ratio 3:5 g/100 ml). probiotic viabilities ranged from 8 to 9 log cfu/g during the 28 days of storage, and inulin and/or okara flour did not affect the viability of la-5 and bb-12. bb-12 resistance to the artificial gastrointestinal  juices was higher than for la-5, since the bb-12 and la-5 populations decreased approximately 0.6 log cfu/g and 3.8 log cfu/g, respectively, throughout storage period. even though the protective effect of inulin and/or okara flour on probiotic microorganisms was not significant, when compared to a fresh culture, the fsp matrix improved bb-12 survival on day 1 of storage and may be considered  a good vehicle for bb-12 and could play an important role in probiotic protection against gastrointestinal juices.

TI  == consumption of fermented milk product with probiotic modulates brain activity.
AB  == background & aims: changes in gut microbiota have been reported to alter signaling mechanisms, emotional behavior, and visceral nociceptive reflexes in rodents. however, alteration of the intestinal microbiota with antibiotics or probiotics has not been shown to produce these changes in humans. we investigated whether consumption of a fermented milk product with probiotic (fmpp) for 4 weeks by healthy women altered brain intrinsic connectivity or responses to emotional attention tasks. methods: healthy women with no gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms were randomly assigned to groups given fmpp (n = 12), a nonfermented milk product (n = 11, controls), or no intervention (n = 13) twice daily for 4 weeks. the fmpp contained bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis, streptococcus thermophiles, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and lactococcus lactis subsp lactis. participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after the intervention to measure brain response to an emotional faces attention task and resting brain activity. multivariate and region of interest analyses were performed. results: fmpp intake was associated with reduced task-related response of a distributed functional network (49% cross-block covariance; p = .004) containing affective, viscerosensory, and somatosensory cortices. alterations in  intrinsic activity of resting brain indicated that ingestion of fmpp was associated with changes in midbrain connectivity, which could explain the observed differences in activity during the task. conclusions: four-week intake of an fmpp by healthy women affected activity of brain regions that control central processing of emotion and sensation.

TI  == effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance in pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == background/objectives: owing to excess body weight and increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines primarily during the third trimester, pregnancy is associated with elevated insulin resistance. to our knowledge, no report is available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum insulin levels in pregnant women. this study was designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance and serum insulin levels of iranian pregnant women. subjects/methods: in this randomized controlled clinical trial, 70 primigravida pregnant women with singleton pregnancy at their third trimester were participated. we randomly assigned participants to consume 200 g per day of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. the probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic culture of two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus la5) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium  animalis bb12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. fasting blood  samples were taken at baseline and after 9-week intervention to measure fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin levels. homeostatic model assessment of insulin  resistance (homa-ir) was used to calculate insulin resistance score. results: although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks did not affect serum insulin levels and homa-ir score, significant differences were found comparing changes in these variables between probiotic and conventional yogurts (changes from baseline in serum insulin levels: +1.2+/-1.2 vs +5.0+/-1.1 muiu/ml, respectively, p=0.02;  and in homa-ir score: -0.2+/-0.3 vs 0.7+/-0.2, respectively, p=0.01). conclusions: it is concluded that in contrast to conventional yogurt, daily consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks maintains serum insulin levels and might help pregnant women prevent developing insulin resistance.

TI  == fatty acid profile, trans-octadecenoic, alpha-linolenic and conjugated linoleic acid contents differing in certified organic and conventional probiotic fermented milks.
AB  == development of dairy organic probiotic fermented products is of great interest as they associate ecological practices and benefits of probiotic bacteria. as organic management practices of cow milk production allow modification of the fatty acid composition of milk (as compared to conventional milk), we studied the influence of the type of milk on some characteristics of fermented milks, such as acidification kinetics, bacterial counts and fatty acid content. conventional and organic probiotic fermented milks were produced using bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis hn019 in co-culture with streptococcus thermophilus ta040 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb340. the use of organic milk led to a higher acidification rate and cultivability of lactobacillus bulgaricus. fatty  acids profile of organic fermented milks showed higher amounts of trans-octadecenoic acid (c18:1, 1.6 times) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including cis-9 trans-11, c18:2 conjugated linoleic (cla-1.4 times), and alpha-linolenic acids (ala-1.6 times), as compared to conventional fermented milks. these higher levels were the result of both initial percentage in the milk and increase during acidification, with no further modification during storage. finally, use of bifidobacteria slightly increased cla relative content in the conventional fermented milks, after 7 days of storage at 4 degrees c, whereas no  difference was seen in organic fermented milks.

TI  == antioxidant properties of potentially probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo activities.
AB  == thirty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (seven bifidobacterium, 11 lactobacillus, six lactococcus, and 10 streptococcus thermophilus) were assayed in vitro for antioxidant activity against ascorbic and linolenic acid oxidation (taa(aa) and taa(la)), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac), intracellular glutathione (tgsh), and superoxide dismutase (sod). wide dispersion of each of taa(aa), taa(la), teac, tgsh, and sod occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. the strains bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dsmz 23032, lactobacillus acidophilus dsmz 23033, and lactobacillus brevis dsmz 23034 exhibited among the highest taa(aa), taa(la), teac, and tgsh values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. these  strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. the probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. the analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive oxygen molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts  of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.

TI  == rapid and accurate bacterial identification in probiotics and yoghurts by maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == probiotic food is manufactured by adding probiotic strains simultaneously with starter cultures in fermentation tanks. here, we investigate the accuracy and feasibility of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) for bacterial identification at the species level in  probiotic food and yoghurts. probiotic food and yoghurts were cultured in columbia and lactobacillus specific agar and tested by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) for the detection and quantification of lactobacillus sp. bacterial identification was performed by maldi-tof analysis and by amplification and sequencing of tuf and 16s rdna genes. we tested 13 probiotic food and yoghurts and we identified by qpcr that they presented 10(6) to 10(7) copies of lactobacillus spp. dna/g. all products contained very large numbers of living bacteria varying from 10(6) to 10(9) colony forming units/g. these bacteria were  identified as lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, bifidobacterium animalis,  lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus. maldi-tof ms presented 92% specificity compared to the molecular assays. in one product we found l. lactis, instead of bifidus spp. which was mentioned on the label and for another  l. delbrueckii and s. thermophilus instead of bifidus spp. maldi-tof ms allows a  rapid and accurate bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified. practical application: maldi-tof ms is rapid and specific for the identification of bacteria in probiotic food and yoghurts. although the safety and functionality of probiotics  are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified.

TI  == effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on lipid profiles in pregnant women: a randomized controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: due to enhanced fat storage primarily during the mid-pregnancy period, pregnancy is associated with elevated levels of lipid profiles. to our knowledge, no reports are available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum lipid profiles in pregnant women. objective: this study was  designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on lipid profiles of iranian pregnant women. methods: this randomized single-blinded controlled clinical trial was performed among 70 pregnant women, primigravida, aged 18-30 years old who were carrying singleton pregnancy at their third trimester. subjects were randomly assigned to consume 200 g/d of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. the probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic  culture of two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus la5) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis bb12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. the conventional yoghurt contained the starter cultures of  s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 9-weeks intervention to measure serum lipid profiles. results: although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks had been resulted in a significant reduction in serum total- (-53.7 mg/dl, p=0.001), ldl- (-35.2 mg/dl, p=0.006) and hdl-cholesterol levels (-9.8 mg/dl, p=0.002) as well as serum triglyceride concentrations (-42.8 mg/dl, p=0.029), no significant differences were found comparing probiotic and conventional yogurts in terms of their effect on serum lipid profiles. within-group differences in conventional yogurt group revealed a  significant reduction in hdl-cholesterol levels (-8.4 mg/dl, p=0.005) and borderline significant reduction in serum total cholesterol concentrations (-21.6 mg/dl, p=0.08). conclusion: in conclusion, consumption of probiotic yogurt among  pregnant women could not affect serum lipid profiles as compared to the conventional yogurt.

TI  == the impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins.
AB  == understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are affected by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks before, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks after consumption of a commercially available fermented milk product (fmp) containing a consortium of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris,  and streptococcus thermophilus. in addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied before and after gavage with all five sequenced fmp strains. no significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed  in the feces of humans consuming the fmp. only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the fmp consortium. however, rna-seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the fmp strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. b. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the fmp consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. the human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of fmp consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to  plant polysaccharide metabolism. these experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of fmps on the human gut microbiome.

TI  == impact of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5-containing yoghurt, on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults.
AB  == this randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel dose-response study investigated the impact of 4-week commercial yoghurt consumption supplemented with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb-12) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5) on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults. fifty-eight volunteers were randomly assigned to three different groups: 1. placebo (no probiotic, no starter and no green tea extract); 2. yoptimal (10(9)cfu/100g of bb-12 and la-5 and 40mg  of green tea extract) and 3. yoptimal-10 (10(10)cfu/100g of bb-12, 10(9)cfu/100g  of la-5 and 40mg of green tea extract). these yoghurt products also contained lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (10(7)cfu/100g) and streptococcus thermophilus (10(10)cfu/100g). the quantitative pcr (qpcr) results showed that there were significant increases (p=0.02) in bifidobacteria counts with the yoptimal treatment as compared to baseline. the fecal numbers of b. animalis subsp. lactis and la-5 significantly increased in the two probiotic treatments compared to the placebo treatment. viable counts of fecal lactobacilli were significantly higher (p=0.05) and those of enterococci were significantly lower (p=0.04) after the intervention when compared to placebo. no significant difference was observed between treatments in volunteers' weight, waist girth, blood pressure, fasting plasma triglyceride and hdl-c concentrations, as well as  cholesterol/hdl-cholesterol ratio. however, a significant increase in plasma cholesterol levels was observed in the placebo group (p=0.0018) but the levels remained stable in the two probiotic yoghurt groups. these results show that probiotic strains supplemented in the form of yoghurt remain active during gut transit and are associated with an increase in beneficial bacteria and a reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria. this trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct00730626.

AB  == the use of synbiotics as health promoters is still poorly defined, and human intervention studies are scarce. this study was designed to evaluate the effects  of a commercialized synbiotic product containing lactobacillus acidophilus la5, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and fructooligosaccharides on the self-reported gastrointestinal well-being and the immunoinflammatory status of healthy human subjects. in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 women and 16 men (25-45 years old) received either three tablets per day of the synbiotic product (2.4 x 10(9) colony-forming units/day) or placebo during 6 weeks. gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were evaluated through a self-administered questionnaire. in those subjects suffering from any kind of digestive disturbance (mild dyspepsia,  flatulence, postprandial bloating, constipation, etc.), improvements in symptoms  after product consumption were also evaluated. blood lymphocyte subsets, phagocytic activity, serum c-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and adhesion molecules concentrations were analyzed prior and after treatment. a significant improvement in overall self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habit was found in the synbiotic group. a marginal effect of treatment (analysis of variance p = .050) was observed with l-selectin, which showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group (p = .019). in addition, basal l-selectin levels  correlated with final intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1 levels (r = 0.468; p = .050), and basal icam-1 levels tended to correlate negatively with final l-selectin concentration (r = -0.457; p = .056). none of these correlations was found in the placebo group. the rest of the immunological parameters studied were not modified by the intervention. in conclusion, consumption of the synbiotic product improves self-perceived bowel habits and might facilitate a better profile of adhesion molecules in healthy adults.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is increased following probiotic administration to preterm pigs.
AB  == preterm birth and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is associated with inappropriate gut colonization and immunity, which may be improved by probiotic bacteria. using a preterm pig model of nec, we investigated the effects of probiotics on intestinal structure, function, microbiology, and immunology in the immediate postnatal period. just after birth, caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were inoculated with lactobacillus paracasei, bifidobacteria animalis, and streptococcus thermophilus (total 2.4 x 10(10)/d) either as live (prolive, n = 14) or gamma-irradiated dead bacteria (prodead, n = 12) and compared with controls (n = 14). all pigs received parenteral nutrition for 2 d followed by enteral formula feeding until tissue collection on d 5. compared with control pigs, intestinal weight was lower and nec incidence was higher in both groups given probiotics (64-67 vs. 14%; p<0.01). hexose absorption, brush border enzyme  activities, and gut barrier function were lower in the prodead group compared with the other groups (p < 0.05), whereas live probiotics induced higher expression of the proinflammatory cytokines il-1alpha and il-6 (p < 0.05). probiotics minimally affected gut colonization, except that live probiotics induced a higher density of b. animalis and lower bacterial diversity in the distal intestinal mucosa and lower scfa concentrations in the colon (p < 0.05). the detrimental effects of probiotic bacteria in this study may relate to the specific strain and dose combination and may have involved the very immature gut  immune system and low nec incidence in the control group. it remains to be determined whether similar adverse responses to probiotics occur in preterm infants.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == dynamics of fecal microbiota in hospitalized elderly fed probiotic lkm512 yogurt.
AB  == the comprehensive dynamics of intestinal microbiota including uncultured bacteria in response to probiotic consumption have not been well studied. the aims of this study were twofold: firstly to analyze the impact on intestinal microbiota of yogurt fermented by bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis lkm512, lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lkm1759, and streptococcus thermophilus lkm1742 (lkm512 yogurt) and placebo fermented by these lactic acid bacterial strains without lkm512; and secondly to investigate the changes in intestinal microbiota  that influence the concentration of pa, one of the beneficial metabolites produced by bacteria in the intestine. the lkm512 yogurt/placebo trial was performed in six hospitalized elderly patients (three men and three women with an average age of 80.3 years) and lasted seven weeks with the following schedule: pre-consumption for one week, lkm512 yogurt consumption for two weeks, washout period for two weeks, and placebo consumption for two weeks. the amount of ingested lkm512 yogurt or placebo was 100 g/day/individual. fecal samples were analyzed using t-rflp and real-time pcr. the t-rflp patterns in five of the six volunteers were changed in a similar fashion by lkm512 yogurt consumption, although these patterns were individually changed following consumption of placebo. it was confirmed that b. animalis subsp. lactis was increased dramatically and lactobacillus spp. tended to be decreased by lkm512 yogurt consumption. some indigenous uncultured bacteria were increased and some decreased by lkm512 yogurt/placebo consumption. the similar changes in the intestinal microbiota of the elderly caused by consumption of the lkm512 yogurt were found to be influenced by the lkm512 strain itself, and not by the lactic acid bacteria in the yogurt. moreover, this study suggests that the increase in intestinal pa concentrations caused by lkm512 yogurt consumption is probably dependent on the lkm512 strain colonizing the intestine.

TI  == prevention of tnbs-induced colitis by different lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains is associated with an expansion of gammadeltat and regulatory t cells of  intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.
AB  == background: probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (lpls) function. data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels). the aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both iels and lpls. methods: balb/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as mix1 (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum), or mix2 (lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). colitis  was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs). probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). colon subpopulations of iels and lpls were assayed by flow cytometry. serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (cba). results: all probiotics colonized the intestine. the 2 mixtures prevented the tnbs-induced intestinal damage, and mix1 was the most effective. the mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in cd4(+) cells of iels and lpls, an increase in gammadeltat cells of iels, and a decrease in gammadeltat cells of lpls. an expansion of t regulatory (treg) cells of iels was induced by mix1 and mix2. both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (il)-10. in addition, mix1 prevented the tnbs-induced increase of il-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma. conclusions: the 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the tnbs-induced colitis; the l. acidophilus and b. longum mixture was the most effective. other than an involvement of lpls, our results report a novel importance of the iels population in probiotic protection.

TI  == effects of fructooligosaccharide and whey protein concentrate on the viability of starter culture in reduced-fat probiotic yogurt during storage.
AB  == viability of yogurt starter cultures and bifidobacterium animalis was assessed during 28 d storage in reduced-fat yogurts containing 1.5% milk fat supplemented  with 1.5% fructooligosaccharide or whey protein concentrate. these properties were examined in comparison with control yogurts containing 1.5% and 3% milk fat  and no supplement. although fructooligosaccharide improved the viability of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus, and bifidobacterium animalis, the highest growth was obtained when milk was supplemented with whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt (p < 0.05). supplementation with 1.5% whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt increased the viable counts of s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus,  and b. animalis by 1 log cycle in the 1st week of storage when compared to control sample. similar improvement in the growth of both yogurt bacteria and b.  animalis was also obtained in the full-fat yogurt containing 3% milk fat and no supplement. addition of whey protein concentrate also resulted in the highest content of lactic and acetic acids (p < 0.05). a gradual increase was obtained in organic acid contents during the storage.

TI  == effect of a probiotic mixed culture on texture profile and sensory performance of minas fresh cheese in comparison with the traditional products.
AB  == the effect of a mixed probiotic culture on instrumental texture, and on sensorial and related properties of minas fresh cheese during refrigerated storage was investigated. three cheese-making trials were prepared: t1, with the traditional  type o starter culture (lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis + l. lactis subsp. cremoris), t2 with only lactic acid and t3, with lactic acid and the probiotic abt culture (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 + bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 + streptococcus thermophilus). instrumental texture profile analysis and related properties were monitored during storage for up to 21 days. lb. acidophilus and b. animalis were present in high levels throughout storage of cheeses t3, above 6 log cfu.g(-1), threshold required for probiotic activity, and stimulation of the  la-5 growth was observed. cheeses with added probiotic abt culture, as well as those made adding lactic acid only, showed to be less brittle and with more favorable sensorial features, due to higher ph values. results indicated that the use of probiotic abt culture complementary to lactic acid for the purpose of substituting the type o (lc. lactis subsp. lactis + lc. lactis subsp. cremoris) culture, traditionally employed for minas cheese production, is advantageous.

TI  == effects of yogurt and bifidobacteria supplementation on the colonic microbiota in lactose-intolerant subjects.
AB  == aims: colonic metabolism of lactose may play a role in lactose intolerance. we investigated whether a 2-week supplementation of bifidobacterium longum (in capsules) and a yogurt enriched with bifidobacterium animalis could modify the composition and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota in 11 chinese lactose-intolerant subjects. methods and results: the numbers of total cells, total bacteria and the eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group in faeces  as measured with fluorescent in situ hybridization and the faecal beta-galactosidase activity increased significantly during supplementation. the number of bifidobacterium showed a tendency to increase during and after supplementation. with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, in subjects in which b. animalis and b. longum were not detected before supplementation, both strains were present in faeces during supplementation, but disappeared after supplementation. the degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine and the oro-caecal transit time were not different before and after supplementation, whereas symptom scores after lactose challenge decreased after supplementation. conclusions: the results suggest that supplementation modifies the amount and metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota and alleviates symptoms in lactose-intolerant subjects. the changes in the colonic microbiota might be among the factors modified by the supplementation which lead to the alleviation of lactose intolerance. significance and impact of the study: this study provides evidence for the possibility of managing lactose intolerance with dietary lactose (yogurt) and probiotics via modulating the colonic microbiota.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  == the outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. this study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. we isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the  genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. all the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. a multiplex-pcr with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. all bifidobacteria were b. animalis subsp. lactis except  one bifidobacterium longum. sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. the lactobacilli were lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. the streptococci were all streptococcus thermophilus. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. all tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin g, rifampicin (mic(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml);  resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin b and spectinomycin (mic(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). the susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.

TI  == identification and differentiation of lactobacillus, streptococcus and bifidobacterium species in fermented milk products with bifidobacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify and discriminate bacteria contained in commercial fermented milks with bifidobacteria by the use of amplified ribosomal  dna restriction analysis (ardra) and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) techniques. ardra of the 16s rdna gene and rapd were performed on 13 lactobacillus strains, 13 streptococcus and 13 bifidobacterium strains isolated from commercial fermented milk. lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium animalis isolates were identified by genus- and  species-pcr and also, they were differentiated at genus and species level by ardra using mwoi restriction enzyme. the ardra technique allowed for the discrimination among these three related genus with the use of only one restriction enzyme, since distinctive profiles were obtained for each genus. therefore it can be a simple, rapid and useful method for routine identification. also, rapd technique allowed the discrimination of all bacteria contained in dairy products, at genus- and strain-level by the performance of one pcr reaction.

TI  == synthesis and utilisation of folate by yoghurt starter cultures and probiotic bacteria.
AB  == thirty-two bacterial isolates from species commonly used in yoghurts and fermented milks were examined for their ability to synthesise or utilise folate during fermentation of skim milk. the organisms examined included the traditional yoghurt starter cultures, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, and probiotic lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and enterococcus faecium. folate was synthesised by s. thermophilus, bifidobacteria,  and e. faecium. s. thermophilus was the dominant producer, elevating folate levels in skim milk from 11.5 ng g(-1) to between 40 and 50 ng g(-1). generally,  lactobacilli depleted the available folate in the skim milk. fermentations with mixed cultures showed that folate production and utilisation by the cultures was  additive. fermentations using a combination of bifidobacterium animalis and s. thermophilus resulted in a six-fold increase in folate concentration. although increased folate levels in yoghurts and fermented milks are possible through judicious selection of inoculum species, the folate levels remain relatively low  in terms of recommended daily allowance.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == a probiotic strain of l. acidophilus reduces dmh-induced large intestinal tumors  in male sprague-dawley rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male sprague-dawley  rats. lactobacillus acidophilus (delvo pro la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus (gg), bifidobacterium animalis (cscc1941), and streptococcus thermophilus (dd145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to  an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (ain-93) rodent diet. four  bacterial treatments were compared: l. acidophilus, l. acidophilus + b. animalis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for l. acidophilus, 20% lower for l. acidophilus + b. animalis and l. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for s. thermophilus. large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with l. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower  for the l. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. for rats fed l. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal dna fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus gg during the probiotic treatment period. however, introduced strains of b. animalis and s. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. it is concluded that this strain of l. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.
