bacteriocin production by pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from marula (scerocarya birrea).
strain st44am, isolated from marula, was identified as pediococcus pentosaceus based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (api 50chl), pcr with species-specific primers and 16s rdna sequencing. strain st44am produces a 6.5 kda class iia bacteriocin, active against lactic acid bacteria, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and listeria monocytogenes. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, triton x-100, triton x-114, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea, nacl and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees c for 120 min or 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity against l. ivanovii susbp. ivanovii atcc19119 and enterococcus faecium hklhs is bactericidal, resulting in cell lyses and enzyme- and dna-leakage. no significant differences in cell growth and bacteriocin production were observed when strain st44am was cultured in mrs broth at 26 degrees c, 30 degrees c and 37 degrees c for 24 h and tested against the same target strain. l. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii atcc 19119 and e. faecium hklhs did, however, differ in sensitivity to bacteriocin st44am (3.3x10(6) au/ml and 2.6x10(4) au/ml, respectively). peptide st44am adsorbs at high levels (1600 au/ml) to producer cells. bacteriocin st44am may be a derivative of pediocin pa-1. this is the first report on the presence of p. pentosaceus in marula and a pediocin pa-1 derivative produced by this species. we are also the first to report on the synergetic effect ciprofloxacin has on a pediocin-like bacteriocin.
