TI  - Biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  - "Nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy. This study identified lactic acid bacteria (LAB) developing during maturation of "Nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. Cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of Trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). A total of 1,059 LAB isolates were screened using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and differentiated into 583 clusters. LAB strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. LAB species most frequently isolated were Lactobacillus paracasei, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing GABA by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). About 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce GABA. Most GABA producers were Lactobacillus paracasei but other GABA producing species included Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. No Enterococcus faecalis or Sc. macedonicus isolates produced GABA. The isolate producing the highest amount of GABA (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a Sc. thermophilus.
TI  - Control of tyramine and histamine accumulation by lactic acid bacteria using bacteriocin forming lactococci.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the competitive effects of three bacteriocin producing strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis against two aminobiogenic lactic acid bacteria, i.e. the tyramine producing strain Enterococcus faecalis EF37 and the histamine producing strain Streptococcus thermophilus PRI60, inoculated at different initial concentrations (from 2 to 6 log cfu/ml). The results showed that the three L. lactis subsp. lactis strains were able to produce bacteriocins: in particular, L. lactis subsp. lactis VR84 and EG46 produced, respectively, nisin Z and lacticin 481, while for the strains CG27 the bacteriocin has not been yet identified, even if its peptidic nature has been demonstrated. The co-culture of E. faecalis EF37 in combination with lactococci significantly reduced the growth potential of this aminobiogenic strain, both in terms of growth rate and maximum cell concentration, depending on the initial inoculum level of E. faecalis. Tyramine accumulation was strongly reduced when E. faecalis EF37 was inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml and, to a lesser extent, at 3 log cfu/ml, as a result of a lower cell load of the aminobiogenic strain. All the lactococci were more efficient in inhibiting streptococci in comparison with E. faecalis EF37; in particular, L. lactis subsp. lactis VR84 induced the death of S. thermophilus PRI60 and allowed the detection of histamine traces only at higher streptococci inoculum levels (5-6 log cfu/ml). The other two lactococcal strains did not show a lethal action against S. thermophilus PRI60, but were able to reduce its growth extent and histamine accumulation, even if L. lactis subsp. lactis EG46 was less effective when the initial streptococci concentration was 5 and 6 log cfu/ml. This preliminary study has clarified some aspects regarding the ratio between bacteriocinogenic strains and aminobiogenic strains with respect to the possibility to accumulate BA and has also showed that different bacteriocins can have different effects on BA production on the same strain. This knowledge is essentially aimed to use bacteriocinogenic lactococci as a predictable strategy against aminobiogenic bacteria present in cheese or other fermented foods.
TI  - Animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Pyrosequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to the genus/species level. Among lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. Twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. All rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (UHT) milk as shown by pH and total titratable acidity (TTA). Presumptive LAB isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus Enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. The phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. All strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. All isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid pH drop in milk, but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. This work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of LAB, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  - Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) are not digested in the proximal intestine. In distal intestine, HMOS collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the HMOS is not well defined. Here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated HMOS in anaerobic culture. This allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific HMOS on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. Most Bifidobacteria spp. and Bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-L-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL), 3-FL, and lactodifucotetraose (LDFT). Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Streptococcus thermophilus ATCC19258 exhibited slight growth, pH reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-FL or 3-FL, but not LDFT. Supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-SL) and 6'-SL promoted moderate growth of Bifidobacterium longum JCM7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, ATCC15708, Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482, and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, SCFA, or both. Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC7830 also consumed 6'-SL. In contrast, Clostridium spp., L. rhamnosus ATCC53103, E. faecalis ATCC29200, Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli K12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. Specific Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides differentially digest specific individual HMOS, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. This suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.
TI  - Bacterial lysates in food allergy prevention.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the concept of food allergy prevention, no successful strategy could be identified until now. Although interventional trials using probiotics, prebiotics, hydrolyzed formula and bacterial lysates early in infancy were found to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis, no effect on food sensitization and allergy could be shown. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies in a farming environment showed that early contact to livestock, bacteria and moulds may upregulate the immune responses regulated via Toll-like receptors and thus prevent allergy. There is increasing evidence that the unbalanced composition of the human microbiome on human skin and mucosal surfaces may be a key player in the development of inflammatory diseases like allergy and asthma. However, during the last 5 years, this concept could not yet be verified in the interventional trials. There are few studies using bacterial lysates, for example, Escherichia coli plus Enterococcus faecalis in ProSymbioflor and heat-killed Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus; however, food allergy prevalence could not be reduced by these interventions. SUMMARY: During the last 5 years, new interventional trials addressed the use of bacterial lysates. There was only an effect on eczema in the ProSymbioflor trial, whereas the trial using B. breve and S. thermophilus in a cow's milk formula showed a slight reduction of food sensitization at the age of 12 months. However, these strategies need further investigation and success seems to be restricted to certain subpopulations.
TI  - Stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG 1363), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), and Streptococcus thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. Both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids into biogenic amine. The conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/L) by Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. Significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (P < 0.05). The role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. Cadaverine accumulation by Enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for St. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by S. Paratyphi A. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by P. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and TMA in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . The result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.
TI  - Identification, structural, and biochemical characterization of a group of large  Csn2 proteins involved in CRISPR-mediated bacterial immunity.
AB  - Many prokaryotic organisms acquire immunity against foreign genetic material by incorporating a short segment of foreign DNA called spacer into chromosomal loci, termed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). The encoded RNAs are processed into small fragments that guide the silencing of the invading genetic elements. The CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins are the main executioners of these processes. Herein, we report the crystal structure of Stu0660 of Streptococcus thermophilus, a Cas protein involved in the acquisition of new spacers. By homotetramerization, Stu0660 forms a central channel which is decorated with basic amino acids and binds linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but not circular dsDNA. Despite undetectably low sequence similarity, two N-terminal domains of Stu0660 are similar to the entire structure of an Enterococcus faecalis Csn2 protein, which also forms a homotetramer and binds dsDNA. Thus, this work identifies a previously unknown group of Stu0660-like Csn2 proteins ( approximately 350 residues), which are larger than the known canonical Csn2 proteins ( approximately 220 residues) by containing an extra C-terminal domain. The commonly present central channel in the two subgroups appears as a design to selectively interact with linear dsDNA.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the bacteriocin-encoding plasmid pDGL1 from Enterococcus durans and genetic characterization of the durancin GL locus.
AB  - Enterococci constitute a significant component of the lactic acid bacteria normally present in the intestinal microflora and include strains that produce bacteriocins. The genetic determinants for durancin GL in Enterococcus durans 41D were identified on the 8347 bp plasmid pDGL1 by plasmid curing experiments. pDGL1 contained nine putative ORFs, with ORF1 and ORF2 encoding plasmid replication proteins, and ORF3 and ORF6 showing high similarity to genes encoding mobilization proteins. The predicted protein encoded by ORF4 showed 74 % identity to BacA, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecalis. The deduced DurA protein contained the conserved motif YYGNG, suggesting that durancin GL is a typical subclass IIa bacteriocin. ORF5 was shown to share 85 % identity to the immunity protein BacB of Enterococcus faecalis. ORF9 displayed 87 % sequence identity to a conserved hypothetical protein of unknown function. To further clarify the minimum requirement for durancin GL production, a 547 bp fragment containing the durAB gene was fitted with the Streptococcus thermophilus P(2201) promoter and then subcloned and heterologously expressed in S. thermophilus ST128. The result demonstrated that the cloned fragment contained all the genetic components required for durancin GL production.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Effect of functional yogurt NY-YP901 in improving the trait of metabolic syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to assess the beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome of functional yogurt NY-YP901 (Namyang Dairy Product Co. Ltd and Nutra R&BT Inc., Seoul, Korea) supplemented with mixture of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis and extra-ingredients containing Bifidobacterium breve (CBG-C2), Enterococcus faecalis FK-23, fibersol-2 and so on. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study was designed as an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study. Treatment and control groups consumed a functional yogurt NY-YP901 (150 ml) and a placebo yogurt twice a day, respectively, for 8 weeks. Body weight and body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipid profiles, fasting glucose with HbA1C and waist circumference were measured before and after treatment. Inclusion criteria were healthy individuals between the ages 20-65 years old who submitted an informed consent. RESULTS: During the period August 2009 to December 2009, 101 healthy participants (31 males and 70 females) finished the study. Treatment group were 53 individuals, and the control group were 48 individuals. In the treatment group consuming NY-YP901, statistically significant beneficial changes were observed in body weight (treatment group vs control group=-0.24+/-1.50 vs +0.64+/-1.39 kg, P<0.05), BMI (-0.10+/-0.58 vs +0.24+/-0.50 kg/m(2), P<0.05 ) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (-7.71+/-14.14 vs -0.43+/-15.32 mg/dl, P<0.05) after 8 weeks. The change in other parameters was not different between the treatment and the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The functional yogurt NY-YP901 reduced LDL-cholesterol, body weight and BMI in the subjects at a 300-ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. From these findings, regular intake of functional yogurt NY-YP901 may be consequently related to improve metabolic syndrome.
TI  - Characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  - The study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from fermented foods in Xi'an, China. LAB strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of Lactobacillus (n = 73), and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and S. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). Some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. Minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of Lactobacillus. The erm(B) gene was detected from two strains of each of L. fermentum and L. vaginalis, and one strain of each of L. plantarum, L. salivarius, L. acidophilus, L. animalis, and S. thermophilus. The tet genes were identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. This is the first time, the authors identified tet(S) gene from L. brevis and L. kefiri. The erm(B) gene from L. fermentum NWL24 and L. salivarius NWL33, and tet(M) gene from L. plantarum NWL22 and L. brevis NWL59 were successfully transferred to Enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. It was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in Xi'an, China and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial biodiversity in koumiss by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and species-specific polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Bacterial biodiversity in traditional koumiss fermented milk was studied by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Target DNA bands were identified according to the reference species ladder, constructed in this study. Comigrating bands present in the DGGE profiles were resolved by species-specific PCR. The results revealed a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial biodiversity in koumiss. The dominant lactic acid bacteria included Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. Frequently encountered bacterial species were Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus kitasatonis, and Lactobacillus kefiri. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Lactobacillus jensenii were occasionally found in this product. In addition, L. buchneri, L. jensenii, and L. kitasatonis, which were never previously isolated by culture-dependent methods, were identified for the first time in the Xinjiang koumiss. Furthermore, conventional cultivation was performed by plating samples on M17, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe, Halligan-Pearce, and Kenner fecal media. The results revealed that lactobacilli were the dominant species in the koumiss ecosystem, which was consistent with the results obtained by the DGGE analysis. This is the first systematic study of the microbial composition in koumiss, and our findings will be helpful in selecting appropriate strains for the manufacture of this product at the industrial level.
TI  - Intra- and interlaboratory performances of two commercial antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods for bifidobacteria and nonenterococcal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In a small-scale harmonization study involving nine laboratories in eight European countries, the intra- and interlaboratory performances of two commercially available systems, i.e., the VetMIC microplate system and Etest, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of nonenterococcal lactic acid bacteria (NELAB) and bifidobacteria were analyzed. In addition, one laboratory also performed standard broth microdilution as a reference method. MICs of tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin, and streptomycin for the type strains of 25 species of NELAB and bifidobacteria and MICs of vancomycin for a selection of relevant taxa were determined. The previously described lactic acid bacterium susceptibility test medium (LSM) and related mixed-medium formulations, all including Iso-Sensitest broth as a basic component, were used as test media. The overall agreement of median MIC ranges +/- 1 log(2) dilution determined by the VetMIC and Etest methods with the median MICs determined by the reference method was very good for tetracycline, ampicillin, and streptomycin (92.3 to 100%) but low for erythromycin (19.5 to 30.7%) and clindamycin (50.0 to 80.8%). There was a consensus among the participating laboratories that VetMIC was preferred over Etest because of its lower cost, better growth support, and more uniform criteria for MIC end point reading. With the range for acceptable intralaboratory reproducibility being defined as the median MIC +/- 1 log(2) dilution, VetMIC results (with 69.2% of all data sets in the acceptable range) were shown to display greater reproducibility than Etest results (with 58.8% of all data sets in the acceptable range). Also at the interlaboratory level, the proportion of MIC values obtained with VetMIC that belonged to the complete agreement category (60.0%) was higher than the proportion of such values obtained with Etest (47.0%), which indicates a higher degree of interlaboratory reproducibility for the former method. Apart from some agent-specific effects, the majority of VetMIC and Etest replicate data sets were situated within a 1- to 2-log(2) dilution range, suggesting that the two methods can be considered to be equivalent for recognizing resistance phenotypes. This multicenter study has further validated the standard use of LSM and related mixed-medium formulations with commercially available systems and formed the basis for the ongoing development of the ISO 10932/IDF 223 standard for susceptibility testing of NELAB and bifidobacteria.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Characterisation of thermotolerant cocci from indigenous flora of 'leben' in algerian arid area and DNA identification of atypical Lactococcus lactis strains.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. By combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16S rRNA gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west Algeria. Forty strains phenotypically related to cocci LAB were identified as belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and other Enterococcus species. No Streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. Ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. In particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% NaCl, at pH 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. Lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. Further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.
TI  - A DNA array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  - An oligonucleotide array based on PCR method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the simultaneous identification of 14 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. The hypervariable regions V3 and V6 of 16S, together with a variable region of 23S rRNA genes and several genes specific for virulence factors were selected. Universal primers and multiplex PCR were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. The dominant species such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, andLeuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dUTPs. The results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic DNA from Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. A clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.
TI  - Study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for Fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  - The bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of Fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. Total microbial DNA was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to study the hypervariable V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and analyzed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Representative bands of DGGE patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. The use of universal primer for PCR-DGGE allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also for other adventitious species. DGGE profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. Some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) recurred in many samples (Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. The microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant LAB but also adventitious bacteria (Macrococcus caseolyticus, Rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (Chryseobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees C of coagulated milk. Pantoea spp. was primarily found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. Finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of E. faecium, E. faecalis and S. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. These species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of the integrative conjugative elements ICESt1 and ICESt3 from Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), also called conjugative transposons, are genomic islands that excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate in the genome of the recipient bacterium. The current investigation shows the intraspecies conjugative transfer of the first described ICEs in Streptococcus thermophilus, ICESt1 and ICESt3. Mitomycin C, a DNA-damaging agent, derepresses ICESt3 conjugative transfer almost 25-fold. The ICESt3 host range was determined using various members of the Firmicutes as recipients. Whereas numerous ICESt3 transconjugants of Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis were recovered, only one transconjugant of Lactococcus lactis was obtained. The newly incoming ICEs, except the one from L. lactis, are site-specifically integrated into the 3' end of the fda gene and are still able to excise in these transconjugants. Furthermore, ICESt3 was retransferred from E. faecalis to S. thermophilus. Recombinant plasmids carrying different parts of the ICESt1 recombination module were used to show that the integrase gene is required for the site-specific integration and excision of the ICEs, whereas the excisionase gene is required for the site-specific excision only.
TI  - Development of chemically defined media supporting high-cell-density growth of lactococci, enterococci, and streptococci.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis IL1403 was used as an experimental strain to develop a chemically defined medium for study of the physiology and metabolic pathways of lactococci. An experimental leave-one-out technique was employed to determine the necessity of each of the 57 chemical components used in medium development. A statistical experimental design approach including three fractional factorial designs and a central composite design was used to optimize the fermentation process with 21 variables composed of 19 nutritional factors grouped from the 57 components and two environmental factors (initial pH and temperature). For L. lactis IL1403, the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with the two optimal chemically defined media developed in this study (ZMB1 and ZMB2) were generally 3.5- to 4-fold higher than the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with the previously described best synthetic media (SA) and 50% to 68% higher than the maximum biomass concentrations obtained with M17, a complex medium commonly used for lactococci. The new chemically defined media support high-cell-density growth of numerous strains of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Selection and use of autochthonous multiple strain cultures for the manufacture of high-moisture traditional Mozzarella cheese.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 18A, Lactobacillus helveticus 2B, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis 20F, Streptococcus thermophilus 22C, Enterococcus faecalis 32C and Enterococcus durans 16E were the most acidifying strains within 146 isolates for natural whey starters. The effect of media and temperature on 2 autochthonous multiple strain cultures (AMSI: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C, 32C and 16E and AMSII: 18A, 2B, 20F and 22C) was studied. Genomic analysis showed a constant cell numbers for AMSII during 16 days of propagation in whey milk. Mozzarella cheese was made by using AMSII, commercial starter (CS) or citric acid (DA). Compared to other cheeses, the DA had a lower level of protein, ash, Ca, free amino acids and a higher level of moisture. Based on confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, AMSII cheese showed the lowest microstructural variations during the period of storage compared to other cheeses. All the sensory attributes were scored highest for AMSII cheese. ASMII extend the shelf-life to ca. 12-15 days instead of the 5-7 days of traditional high-moisture Mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  - Exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy Streptococcus species S. thermophilus, S. macedonicus and S. salivarius, were exposed to acid, osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. Three strains of dairy related streptococci, Lactococcus lactis ATCC11454, Enterococcus faecium DSM20477 and Enterococcus faecalis DSM20478, were included for comparison purposes. Acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. Cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrilamide Gel Electrophoresis, respectively. All strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. With a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. For some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses. Matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. Significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. Adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. Adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (DnaK, GprE, GroEL, and GroES) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between stress response and band intensity was evident.
TI  - Crystal structure of the YdjC-family protein TTHB029 from Thermus thermophilus HB8: structural relationship with peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase.
AB  - The YdjC-family protein is widely distributed, from human to bacteria, but so far no three-dimensional structure and functional analysis of this family of proteins has been reported. We determined the three-dimensional structure of the YdjC homolog TTHB029 at a resolution of 2.9A. The overall structure of the monomer consists of (betaalpha)-barrel fold forming a homodimer. Asp21, His60, and His127 residues coordinate to Mg(2+) as a possible active site. TTHB029 shows structural similarity to the peptidoglycan N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpPgdA). The active site groove of SpPgdA includes the Zn(2+) coordinated to Asp276, His326, and His330. Despite the low sequence identity, metal-binding residues of Asp-His-His were conserved among the two enzymes. There were definitive differences, however, in that one of the histidines of the metal-binding site was substituted for the other histidine located on the other loop. Moreover, these important metal-binding residues and the residues of the presumed active site are fully conserved in YdjC-family protein.
TI  - A genome-wide survey of short coding sequences in streptococci.
AB  - Identification of short genes that encode peptides of fewer than 60 aa is challenging, both experimentally and in silico. As a consequence, the universe of these short coding sequences (CDSs) remains largely unknown, although some are acknowledged to play important roles in cell-cell communication, particularly in Gram-positive bacteria. This paper reports a thorough search for short CDSs across streptococcal genomes. Our bioinformatic approach relied on a combination of advanced intrinsic and extrinsic methods. In the first step, intrinsic sequence information (nucleotide composition and presence of RBSs) served to identify new short putative CDSs (spCDSs) and to eliminate the differences between annotation policies. In the second step, pseudogene fragments and false predictions were filtered out. The last step consisted of screening the remaining spCDSs for lines of extrinsic evidence involving sequence and gene-context comparisons. A total of 789 spCDSs across 20 complete genomes (19 Streptococcus and one Enterococcus) received the support of at least one line of extrinsic evidence, which corresponds to an average of 20 short CDSs per million base pairs. Most of these had no known function, and a significant fraction (31%) are not even annotated as hypothetical genes in GenBank records. As an illustration of the value of this list, we describe a new family of CDSs, encoding very short hydrophobic peptides (20-23 aa) situated just upstream of some of the positive transcriptional regulators of the Rgg family. The expression of seven other short CDSs from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1066 that encode peptides ranging in length from 41 to 56 aa was confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and revealed a variety of expression patterns. Finally, one peptide from this list, encoded by a gene that is not annotated in GenBank, was identified in a cell-envelope-enriched fraction of S. thermophilus CNRZ1066.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - Artisanal and experimental Pecorino Siciliano cheese: microbial dynamics during manufacture assessed by culturing and PCR-DGGE analyses.
AB  - Traditional artisanal Pecorino Siciliano (PS) cheeses, and two experimental PS cheeses were manufactured using either raw or pasteurised ewes' milk with the addition of starter cultures. The bacterial diversity and dynamics of the different cheese types were evaluated both by culturing and characterisation of isolates, and a culture-independent approach based on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Following cultivation, artisanal and experimental cheese types showed similar microbial counts, and isolates belonging to Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides were identified by phenotypic characterisation and comparison of the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 16S rRNA gene to that of reference species. The culture-independent fingerprinting technique PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of V6 to V8 regions of the 16S rRNA gene of samples taken during artisanal PS cheese manufacture, from raw milk to the ripened cheese, indicated relevant shifts in the microbial community structure. The dominance of Streptococcus bovis and Lactococcus lactis species in the traditional artisanal PS was revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Comparison of DGGE profiles of samples from milk to ripened cheese, derived from artisanal procedure and the two experimental PS cheeses during production showed similar trends with the presence of intense bands in common. Nevertheless, the profiles of several artisanal cheeses from different farms appeared more diverse, and these additional species are probably responsible for the generally superior flavour and aroma development of traditional PS cheese.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Characterization of mesentericin ST99, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99 isolated from boza.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from Belogratchik, Bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. With the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum. The cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99, inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, several Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Clostridium spp., Carnobacterium spp., L. mesenteroides and Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, was recorded in MRS broth after 24 h at 30 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of protease IV and pronase E resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin ST99. No loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, Triton X-100, N-laurylsarcosin, EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Mesentericin ST99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2 to 12. Metabolically active cells of L. innocua treated with mesentericin ST99 did not undergo lysis. Mesentericin ST99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain ST99. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by Sep-Pack C18 chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Pediocin production by recombinant lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Production of the anti-listerial bacteriocin, pediocin, by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) transformed with the cloning vector pPC418 (Ped+, 9.1 kb) was influenced by composition of media and incubation temperature. Maximum pediocin production, tested against Listeria innocua, by electrotransformants of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis was measured in tryptone/lactose/yeast extract medium after 24 h growth at 30 degrees C, while incubation at 40 degrees C was optimum for Ped+ transformants of Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecalis. The amount of pediocin produced by S. thermophilus in skim milk and cheese whey supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract was estimated as 51,000 units ml(-1) and 25,000 units ml(-1), respectively. Pediocin production remained essentially unchanged in reconstituted skim milk or whey media diluted up to 10-fold. The results demonstrate the capacity of recombinant strains of LAB to produce pediocin in a variety of growth media including skim milk and inexpensive cheese whey-based media, requiring minimum nutritional supplementation.
TI  - Cell wall attachment of a widely distributed peptidoglycan binding domain is hindered by cell wall constituents.
AB  - The C-terminal region (cA) of the major autolysin AcmA of Lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (LysM domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. The cA domain could be deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. This AcmA derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete. The cA domain and a chimeric protein consisting of cA fused to the C terminus of MSA2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via cA. The fusion protein also bound to many other Gram-positive bacteria. By chemical treatment of purified cell walls of L. lactis and Bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with cA. Immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, B. subtilis, Lactobacillus sake, and Lactobacillus casei cells. Based on these studies, we propose that LysM-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of AcmA. Lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. For L. lactis SK110, it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no MSA2cA binding is observed.
TI  - The ICESt1 element of Streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  - The 34,734-bp element ICESt1 from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. ICESt1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. Six proteins of the putative conjugative system of ICESt1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis. A comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low G+C bacteria including Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium difficile, E. faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. Sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. These exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. Therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. We propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "Integrative and Conjugative Elements" (ICEs), irrespective of the integration specificity.
TI  - The potential of a polyphasic PCR-dGGE approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production: bias of culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  - A polyphasic PCR-DGGE approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (NWCs) for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese production. Total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing DNA directly extracted from the original samples of NWC. In addition, DNA extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. The 16S rDNA V3 region was amplified using DNA from NWC as well as DNA from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by DGGE. The microbial entities occurring in NWCs were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing of DGGE bands: four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) closest relative of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of DNA directly extracted from NWC while two other LAB, Lactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus faecalis, were identified by analyzing DNA from the cultivable community. The developed PCR-DGGE analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from NWC and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. Moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.
TI  - Comparison of statistical methods for identification of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium from randomly amplified polymorphic DNA patterns.
AB  - Thermophilic streptococci play an important role in the manufacture of many European cheeses, and a rapid and reliable method for their identification is needed. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR (RAPD-PCR) with two different primers coupled to hierarchical cluster analysis has proven to be a powerful tool for the classification and typing of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis (G. Moschetti, G. Blaiotta, M. Aponte, P. Catzeddu, F. Villani, P. Deiana, and S. Coppola, J. Appl. Microbiol. 85:25-36, 1998). In order to develop a fast and inexpensive method for the identification of thermophilic streptococci, RAPD-PCR patterns were generated with a single primer (XD9), and the results were analyzed using artificial neural networks (Multilayer Perceptron, Radial Basis Function network, and Bayesian network) and multivariate statistical techniques (cluster analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and classification trees). Cluster analysis allowed the identification of S. thermophilus but not of enterococci. A Bayesian network proved to be more effective than a Multilayer Perceptron or a Radial Basis Function network for the identification of S. thermophilus, E. faecium, and E. faecalis using simplified RAPD-PCR patterns (obtained by summing the bands in selected areas of the patterns). The Bayesian network also significantly outperformed two multivariate statistical techniques (linear discriminant analysis and classification trees) and proved to be less sensitive to the size of the training set and more robust in the response to patterns belonging to unknown species.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Molecular and physiological characterization of dominant bacterial populations in traditional mozzarella cheese processing
AB  - The development of the dominant bacterial populations during traditional Mozzarella cheese production was investigated using physiological analyses and molecular techniques for strain typing and taxonomic identification. Analysis of RAPD fingerprints revealed that the dominant bacterial community was composed of 25 different biotypes, and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA demonstrated that the isolated strains belonged to Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Leuc. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Strep. bovis, Strep. uberis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. garviae, Carnobacterium divergens, C. piscicola, Aerococcus viridans, Staphylococcus carnosus, Staph. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. sulphureus and Enterococcus spp. The bacterial populations were characterized for their physiological properties. Two strains, belonging to Strep. thermophilus and L. lactis subsp. lactis, were the most acidifying; theL. lactis subsp. lactis strain was also proteolytic and eight strains were positive to citrate fermentation. Moreover, the molecular techniques allowed the identification of potential pathogens in a non-ripened cheese produced from raw milk.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the pediocin operon in Streptococcus thermophilus and other lactic fermentation bacteria.
AB  - Production of pediocin in Pediococcus acidilactici is associated with pMBR1.0, which encodes prepediocin, a pediocin immunity protein, and two proteins involved in secretion and precursor processing. These four genes are organized as an operon under control of a single promoter. We have constructed shuttle vectors that contain all four structural genes, the chromosomal promoter ST(P2201) from Streptococcus thermophilus, and repA from the 2-kbp S. thermophilus plasmid pER8. The recombinant plasmid, pPC318, expressed and secreted active pediocin in Escherichia coli. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and Enterococcus faecalis were electrotransformed with pPC418, a modified vector fitted with an erythromycin resistance tracking gene. Pediocin was produced and secreted in each of the lactic acid bacteria, and production was stable for up to ten passages. The expression of pediocin in dairy fermentation microbes has important implications for bacteriocins as food preservatives in dairy products.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Production of cholera toxin B subunit in Lactobacillus.
AB  - The intracellular expression of the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) was first achieved in Lactobacillus paracasei LbTGS1.4 with an expression cassette including the P25 promoter of Streptococcus thermophilus combined with the translation initiation region from the strongly expressed L. pentosus D-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhD). Secretion of CTB was next attempted in L. paracasei LbTGS1.4 and L. plantarum NCIMB8826 with four different signal sequences from exported proteins of lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis Usp45 and PrtP, Enterococcus faecalis unknown protein and S. pyogenes M6 protein). Host-dependent secretion of CTB was clearly observed: whereas none of the secretion cassettes led to detectable CTB in the extracellular fraction of L. paracasei LbTGS1.4, secretion of CTB molecules was clearly achieved with three of the selected signal sequences in L. plantarum NCIMB8826.
TI  - Conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in PCR amplification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). An appropriately-sized PCR product was obtained from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL43-1 and MG1363; Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LC10-1, LC11-1, and LC12-1; Streptococcus thermophilus ST1-1; Enterococcus faecalis EF1-1; Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1-1; Lactobacillus helveticus LH1-1; Pediococcus pentosaceus PP1-1; and Bifidobacterium animalis BA1-1. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the human Y-box factor. The amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the LAB strains. It is possible, therefore, that this protein in LAB may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an RNA chaperone unwinding tightly folded RNA molecules.
TI  - Primary and secondary structures of rRNA spacer regions in enterococci.
AB  - The 16S-23S and 23S-5S rRNA spacer DNA regions (spacer regions 1 and 2, respectively) from Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans and Enterococcus mundtii were amplified by PCR. Their nucleotide sequences were established and a secondary structure model showing the interaction between the two spacer regions was built. Whereas lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto are characterized by a single type of spacer region 1, the enterococci show a high degree of variability in this region; thus the spacer regions 1 with and without tRNA(Ala) were characterized. However, as shown for lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto, the tRNA(Ala) gene does not encode the 3'-terminal CCA trinucleotide. A putative antitermination signal is found downstream from the tRNA(Ala) gene. Based on comparison with Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, a double-stranded processing stem is proposed. In E, hirae, one of the three different types of spacer region 1 contains no tRNA(Ala), but displays a 107 nt insertion that forms a long stem-loop structure. A similar insertion (115 nt in length) was found in E. faecium and base compensatory mutations preserve the ability to form the long stem-loop structure. Such insertions may correspond to mobile intervening sequences, as found in the 23S rRNA coding sequences of some Gram-negative bacteria. The spacer regions 1 and 2 from the three subgroups of streptococci were compared, and except for the tRNA(Ala) gene and the double-stranded processing sites, little similarity was found, which opens large possibilities for future development of DNA-based typing methods.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of pWC1, a pC194-type rolling circle replicon in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pFX3 (rolling circle, pE194-type) or pCI305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. The plasmid, pWC1, was compatible with both pCI3340 (a pCI305 derivative) and pFX3 in L. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. Sequence analysis of pWC1 showed one major ORF encoding a protein with a deduced size of 316 amino acids (aa). Database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pFX- and pCI-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pC194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. A pC194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in L. lactis. Further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pWC1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. The chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pC194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pWC1 to give pCP12. The host range of pCP12 included Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli. Both pCP12 and to a lesser extent pWC1 generated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in L. lactis. A possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pWC1 and by comparing levels of ssDNA produced by pCP12 deletion derivatives. The pWC1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.
TI  - Efficient insertional mutagenesis in lactococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - In lactococci, the study of chromosomal genes and their regulation is limited by  the lack of an efficient transposon mutagenesis system. We associated the insertion sequence ISS1 with the thermosensitive replicon pG+ host to generate a mutagenic tool that can be used even in poorly transformable strains. ISS1 transposition is random in different lactococcal strains as well as in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus thermophilus. High-frequency random insertion (of about 1%) obtained with this system in Lactococcus lactis allows efficient mutagenesis, with typically one insertion per cell. After ISS1 replicative transposition, the chromosome contains duplicated ISS1 sequences flanking pG+ host. This structure allows cloning of the interrupted gene. In addition, efficient excision of the plasmid leaves a single ISS1 copy at the mutated site, thus generating a stable mutant strain with no foreign markers. Mutants obtained by this transposition system are food grade and can thus be used in fermentation processes.
TI  - Development of RAPD protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  - A protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments has been developed. Using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic DNA. Different conditions of DNA release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. This RAPD protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. helveticus, Lact. casei, Lact. reuteri, Lact. plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Anti-mutagenic and immuno-stimulatory properties of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Statistically significant antigenotoxic activity was exerted by six of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria tested (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Staphylococcus carnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L. rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecium and En. faecalis) against nitrovin and 2-aminofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA97. The mutagenic activity of both mutagens was substantially decreased by viable bacteria; cells heated to 100 degrees C for 15 min were ineffective. In vitro, En. faecium stimulated the basic metabolic activities of human neutrophils which were essential for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity, whereas stimulation of guinea-pig macrophages was not so effective. Similar immuno-stimulatory effects were observed with both viable and heat-inactivated bacteria.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding the H2O2-forming NADH oxidase from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans induces both H2O2-forming and H2O-forming NADH oxidases in the presence of O2 [M. Higuchi, J. Gen. Microbiol., 130, 1819-1826 (1984)]. In this paper, a nox-1 gene encoding H2O2-forming NADH oxidase (NOX-1) from Streptococcus mutans was cloned, and the nucleotides sequenced. The structural gene of nox-1 consisted of 1530 base pairs, which encode a polypeptide consisting of 510 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55,196 Da. The deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence was consistent with that previously found for the purified NOX-1 protein. The nox-1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli using its own promoter. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of NOX-1 with those of NADH oxidases from other microorganisms showed identities of 55.6%, 20.8%, 20.3%, and 7.3% for those of Amphibacillus xylanus Ep01, Streptococcus faecalis 10C1, Thermoanaerobium brockii Rt8.G4, and Thermus thermophilus HB8, respectively.
TI  - Antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of Taleggio, an Italian soft cheese.
AB  - Enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes. Inhibition of L. innocua in milk by different starter cultures was evaluated. Milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (Enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). Tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h of Taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. Results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of L. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of pH decrease and bacteriocin production. Overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of Taleggio cheese during ripening, when L. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.
TI  - Partial characterization of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 with a polymerase chain reaction-based approach.
AB  - With degenerated oligonucleotide primers for conserved regions of bacterial sigma factor proteins, a 117-bp internal DNA fragment of an rpoD-like gene of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA sequence of this PCR product was determined by cycle sequencing, and the deduced amino acid sequence of this internal fragment showed an extensive homology with the known sigma factor sequences from six other microorganisms and present a 13-amino acid region corresponding to the typical "RpoD box" of primary sigma factors. This PCR product was used as a probe to specifically detect sigma homologs in Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. These data are consistent with the existence of a high similarity between the primary sigma factors from diverse Gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - Distribution and purification of aspartate racemase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The distribution of aspartate racemase (EC 5.1.1.13) in various kinds of bacteria demonstrated that the enzyme occurs in lactic acid bacteria, such as Streptococcus species and Lactobacillus species. The enzyme from Streptococcus thermophilus IAM10064 was more thermostable than that from Streptococcus lactis IAM1198 which contained the enzyme most abundantly among the lactic acid bacteria we examined here. We purified the enzyme about 3400-fold to homogeneity from cell-free extract of S. thermophilus, which is composed of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of 28,000 as a homodimer. The enzyme utilizes specifically aspartate as a substrate, but not alanine and glutamate. Maximal reaction velocity was observed at 37 degrees C and around pH 8.0. The sequence of the NH2-terminal amino acids of the enzyme was determined to be Met-Glu-Asn-Phe-Phe-Ser-Ile-Leu-Gly-XXX-Met-Gly-Thr-Met-Ala-Thr-Glu-Ser- Phe-.
TI  - Serological identification of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (Str. thermophilus) has no group-specific antigen. HCl extracts of 551 strains of streptococci isolated from cheese or yogurt (123 Str. thermophilus and 428 Enterococcus faecalis - Ent. faecium spp.) were examined with three type-specific antisera prepared against representatives of Str. thermophilus and also with Lancefield group D antisera. All typical (80) or atypical (43) strains of Str. thermophilus reacted with at least one type-specific antiserum and none of the enterococci reacted. Only two strains reacted with both type-specific and group antisera.
TI  - Purification and substrate specificity of a strongly hydrophobic extracellular metalloendopeptidase ("gelatinase") from Streptococcus faecalis (strain 0G1-10).
AB  - An extracellular Zn-endopeptidase was purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrates of Streptococcus faecalis (human oral strain 0G1-10) by a procedure that comprised concentration in an Amicon Hollow Fiber System, ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel permeation chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (batch operation on phenyl-sepharose Cl-4B), followed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column, and finally FPLC on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column. The enzyme is a 31.5-kDa strongly hydrophobic protein with an isoelectric point of 4.6 and a broad pH optimum of 6 to 8. The substrate specificity of the enzyme is similar to that of the mammalian membrane endopeptidase-24.11 and Streptococcus thermophilus thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.4) in hydrolyzing preferentially the Phe24-Phe25 bond in insulin B-chain, followed by cleavage of the His5-Leu6 bond. The enzyme was especially active on Azocoll and gelatin; soluble and insoluble collagens were hydrolyzed at a lower rate. S. faecalis sex pheromone-related peptides and several mammalian bioactive peptides were cleaved at sites involving pronounced hydrophobicity. The enzyme did not hydrolyze small synthetic peptide derivatives (phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-L-Pro-L-Leu-Gly-L-Pro-D-Arg and 2-furylacryloyl-L-Leu-Gly-L-Ala) that are typically attacked by "true" bacterial collagenases. Chemical modification indicated the importance of histidyl, carboxyl, and tyrosyl groups in enzyme activity, suggesting that this enzyme may thus be classified as a metalloprotease II (EC 3.4.24.4). The enzyme is strongly inhibited by a 720-kDa factor present in rat inflammatory exudate. The pronounced ability of the enzyme to attack collagenous materials and certain bioactive peptides suggests its participation in inflammatory processes involving the presence of S. faecalis.
TI  - Evidence for the conjugal transfer of the broad host range plasmid pIP501 into strains of Lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  - The conjugative broad host range plasmid pIP501 was transferred from Streptococcus faecalis to a series of strains of lactic streptococci used commercially as dairy starter cultures. With these transconjugants as donors the plasmid was exconjugated to two strains of Lactobacillus helveticus and a commercially used strain of Strep. thermophilus. There was evidence that the plasmid could transfer between isogenic derivatives of one of the strains of Lact. helveticus. Transfer from Lact. helveticus to Strep. faecalis was also detected but at a low frequency. There was no evidence for the conjugal transfer of plasmid pIP501 into a strain of Lact. bulgaricus by exconjugation from either lactic streptococci or Lactobacillus sp.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization as an alternative vector delivery system for lactic streptococci.
AB  - Due to the current variability in applying polyethylene glycol-mediated protoplast transformation to lactic streptococci, a study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of conjugative mobilization as an alternative method for vector delivery. By using the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pVA797, the partially homologous cloning vector pVA838 was successfully introduced into various strains of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus cremoris, Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Streptococcus faecalis. Frequencies ranged from 10(-2) to 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. Both pVA797 and pVA838 were acquired intact, without alteration in functionality. Also, the shuttle vector pSA3, which shares partial homology with pVA797, was mobilized via conjugation. The use of S. lactis LM2301 as the intermediate donor allowed the use of physiologic and metabolic characteristics for recipient differentiation. The construction of a vector containing a "DNA cassette" conferring mobilization and the resolution, segregation, and stability of the cointegrates, pVA797, pVA838, and pSA3, are also reported.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
