TI  == antibacterial activity of glucomoringin bioactivated with myrosinase against two  important pathogens affecting the health of long-term patients in hospitals.
AB  == glucosinolates (gls) are natural compounds present in species of the order brassicales and precursors of bioactive isothiocyanates (itcs). in the recent years, they have been studied mainly for their chemopreventive as well as novel chemotherapeutics properties. among them 4-(alpha-l-rhamnosyloxy)benzyl glucosinolate (glucomoringin; gmg), purified from seeds of moringa oleifera lam., a plant belonging to the moringaceae family, represents an uncommon member of the gl family with peculiar characteristics. this short communication reports new evidences about the properties of gmg and presents a new innovative utilization of the molecule. the bioactivation of gmg by myrosinase enzyme just before treatment, permits to maximize the power of the final product of the reaction, which is the 4-(alpha-l-rhamnosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate (gmg-itc). we tested the antibiotic activity of this latter compound on two strains of pathogens affecting the health of patients in hospital, namely staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus casseliflavus, and on the yeast candida albicans. results show that  the sensibility of s. aureus baa-977 strain and e. casseliflavus to gmg-itc treatment reveals an important possible application of this molecule in the clinical care of patients, more and more often resistant to traditional therapies.

TI  == environmental contamination by dog&#8217;s faeces: a public health problem?
AB  == the risk to public health from the large number of dog stools present on streets  of urban areas is cause for concern. dog faeces may be a serious hazard because they may contain microorganisms that are both pathogenic to humans and resistant  to several classes of antibiotics. the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for zoonotic infections and for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in canine faeces which contaminates the urban environment. a total of 418 canine faecal samples were collected from streets in seven areas of bari, southern italy. we have isolated multi-drug resistant enterococci and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from these dog faecal samples. the presence of the resistant bacteria in an urban environment may represent a public health hazard which requires control measures by competent authorities. no salmonella, yersinia or campylobacter species were isolated. giardia cysts were detected in 1.9% of the samples. the predominant enterococcus species were e. faecium (61.6%), e. gallinarum (23.3%) and e. casseliflavus (5.5%). other species, including e. faecalis were also isolated. these strains were resistant to clindamycin (86.3%), tetracycline (65.7%), erythromycin (60.27%) and ampicillin (47.9%). high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was found in 65.7% of enterococci. resistance to three or more antibiotics and six or more antibiotics were observed in 67.12% and 38.4% of enterococcus spp., respectively. resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not detected in any of the enterococcus spp. isolated. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 0.7% of the faecal samples. canine faeces left on the streets may represent a risk factor for transmission of microorganisms and a reservoir of multidrug- resistant bacteria thus contributing to the spread of resistance genes into an urban area.

TI  == assessment of safe enterococci as bioprotective cultures in low-acid fermented sausages combined with high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == three bacteriocinogenic, non-aminogenic and non-virulent enterococcus strains (enterococcus faecium ctc8005, enterococcus devriesei ctc8006 and enterococcus casseliflavus ctc8003) were used as starter cultures in low-acid fermented sausages to assess their competitiveness and their bioprotective potential against listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the inoculated strains  were successfully monitored by rapd-pcr. all the strains were able to grow, survive and dominate the endogenous enterococci population and avoided the growth of enterobacteriaceae. e. devriesei ctc8006 and e. faecium ctc8005 particularly inhibited the growth of l. monocytogenes during the whole ripening process. s. aureus was not affected by the inoculated bacteriocinogenic enterococci strains.  the application of high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) treatment (600 mpa for 5 min)  at the end of ripening (day 21) produced an immediate reduction in the counts of  enterobacteriaceae to levels <1 log cfu/g and promoted a decrease of 1-log unit in the counts of s. aureus. e. faecium ctc8005, which reduced the counts of l. monocytogenes ca. 2 log cfu/g immediately after stuffing and in combination with  hhp treatment promoted a further reduction of 1 log cfu/g in the pathogen counts. the combination of e. faecium ctc8005 and hhp was the most efficient antilisterial approach.

TI  == first detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk and the dfrk-carrying transposon tn559 in enterococci.
AB  == the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage  was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.

TI  == assessment of two commercial susceptibility test methods for determination of daptomycin mics.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against several important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. because the mechanism of action of daptomycin is calcium-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane, susceptibility testing requires medium supplemented with a physiological level of calcium. this study assessed two food  and drug administration-cleared commercial test devices for determination of daptomycin mics, etest and justone. a collection of 220 selected isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum, were tested by both methods. included in the collection were 22 s. aureus and 14  enterococcus sp. isolates that were recovered from patients and were nonsusceptible on the basis of the daptomycin mics. as the reference method for comparison, all isolates were tested by the clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution method incorporating cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth with 50 microg/ml calcium. daptomycin mics agreed, within 1 twofold dilution, for 97% of the isolates by etest and for 100% by justone. however, daptomycin mics determined by etest were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 65% of the enterococcus sp. isolates tested. this resulted in 28.5% very major (vm) errors (4/14) with enterococci (all e. faecium) but none (0/22) with staphylococci. use of justone yielded mics that were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 69% of the staphylococci and 25% of the enterococci. this resulted in 13.6% vm errors (3/22) with staphylococci and 14.3% vm errors (2/14)  with enterococci. the manufacturer-recommended justone inoculum preparation resulted in mean colony counts of only 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml in the wells of the strip. increasing the inoculum to 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) cfu/ml eliminated two of five vm errors upon retesting. no major interpretive errors occurred with  either device. in summary, daptomycin mics generated by the etest or justone method generally agreed within 1 dilution of the reference daptomycin mics. however, both devices produced slightly lower mics that resulted in some vm errors.

TI  == partial characterization of enterocin mr99 from a corn silage isolate of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == aims: to assess the inhibitory activity on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage.  methods and results: the inhibitory activity of strains of enterococcus faecalis  (58), enterococcus faecium (35), enterococcus gallinarum (3) and enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and atcc). enterococcus faecalis mr99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, listeria spp., staphylococcus aureus, clostridium spp., bacillus spp., escherichia coli, shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri. the bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. the partially chromatography-purified mr99 enterocin (ppe) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 da and a pi of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. it appeared stable to adjustment of ph 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees c. enterocin mr99 was bactericidal on strains of listeria monocytogenes, staph. aureus, and bovine  mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on e. coli. although enterocins mr99 and as48 have inhibitory activity on gram-negative bacilli, pcr studies demonstrated  a lack of relationship between them. conclusions: the active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. significance and impact of the study: the biological properties of ent. faecalis  mr99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied  in human and veterinary health programmes.

TI  == detection of a novel aph(2") allele (aph[2"]-ie) conferring high-level gentamicin resistance and a spectinomycin resistance gene ant(9)-ia (aad 9) in clinical isolates of enterococci.
AB  == aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (ames) are major factors that confer aminoglycoside resistance to enterococci. in an epidemiologic study on distribution of 12 ame genes in 534 recent clinical strains isolated from a japanese hospital, two uncommon ame genes, ant(9)-ia and a novel aph(2") allele,  aph(2")-ie, were detected. ant(9)-ia had been reported only in staphylococcus aureus and encodes spectinomycin adenylyltransferase ant(9)-i, which confers resistance to spectinomycin. the ant(9)-ia gene was detected in three strains, a  single strain each of enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. avium. nucleotide sequences of ant(9)-ia from these three enterococcal species were identical to that reported for s. aureus and considered to be located on tn 554. the new aph(2") allele, designated aph(2")-ie, was identified in three e. faecium strains. the aph(2")-ie allele was genetically close to aph(2")-id reported in e. casseliflavus (93.7% amino acid sequence identity; 96.3% similarity), while distant from aph(2")-ia, aph(2")-ib, or aph(2")-ic (26.3-29.5% amino acid sequence identity). sequence divergence between aph(2")-id and aph(2")-ie was mostly located in amino-terminal half. in contrast, sequences corresponding to the three motifs required for aminoglycoside phosphotransferase were conserved except for a single amino acid. three e. faecium strains having aph(2")-ie showed high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, but not to kanamycin, dibekacin, and tobramycin, unlike enzyme specificity described for aph(2")-id in  e. casseliflavus. such a difference in resistance phenotype was suggested to be related to amino acid sequence divergence between aph(2")-id and aph(2")-ie.

TI  == evaluation of the prevalence and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus among patients on dialysis.
AB  == background: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) has been reported among long-term dialysis patients, although risk factors for vre colonization are not well defined. this study aims to appraise the prevalence and risk factors for vre colonization among patients on long-term dialysis therapy, as well as the mechanisms for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. methods: this is a cross-sectional survey of 320 patients on long-term dialysis therapy at 2 hospitals of the federal university of sao paulo from june 2001 to march 2003. fecal samples were collected from each patient once a week for 1 month. samples with positive test results for vre were submitted to molecular typing through automated ribotyping. results: vre prevalence was 14.4%. there were significant associations between vre and dialysis type (hemodialysis, p = 0.04), number of hospitalizations (p = 0.03), low hemoglobin level (p = 0.03), and leukocytosis (p = 0.05). among samples with vre (n = 56), 25% were enterococcus faecium; 10.7%, enterococcus casseliflavus; 57.1%, enterococcus gallinarum; and 3.6%, enterococcus faecalis. all samples isolated were sensitive to teicoplanin, except for e faecium samples, which were strongly resistant, although 9 of 14 patients with this isolate presented the same ribogroup (111-s-4). typing of 6 samples from 8 dialysis patients with e gallinarum was performed, showing a predominant ribogroup (112-s-4). conclusion: hospital environment, hemodialysis, anemia, and  leukocytosis appear to be associated with vre colonization. these results suggest that dissemination of these bacteria among patients on long-term dialysis therapy may be taking place.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria from icu patients in uk hospitals to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == microbiologists in 25 sentinel laboratories were each asked to refer up to 100 clinically-significant gram-positive bacteria isolated from consecutive intensive care unit (icu) patients. a total of 1595 isolates were collected from patients in 23 hospitals; these included staphylococcus aureus (47.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (30.6%), enterococci (14.3%), pneumococci (2.8%) and other streptococci (3.5%). a few coryneforms, other bacilli and a nocardia sp. were also collected. rates of oxacillin resistance among s. aureus and cns isolates were 59.3 and 78.5%, respectively. vancomycin-resistant s. aureus were not detected, although two isolates (0.3%) were resistant to teicoplanin [minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) 8 mg/l]. in contrast, 13.7% of cns were teicoplanin resistant (mics 8-32 mg/l) and 1.2% were resistant to vancomycin. among the enterococci, 72.5% were enterococcus faecalis and 24.5% were enterococcus faecium, the remainder including isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus or enterococcus gallinarum. eighteen percent of e. faecium isolates were vancomycin-resistant, compared with only 3% of e. faecalis isolates. rates of high-level gentamicin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium were 40 and 25%, respectively. nine percent of pneumococci and streptococci were resistant to penicillin, with 7 and 11%, respectively, resistant to erythromycin. none of the  isolates showed resistance to linezolid, with the mics for the entire study population falling in the range of 0.5-4 mg/l.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, rwj-54428, against streptococci, enterococci and staphylococci, including glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the need for new antimicrobial agents with activity against gram-positive organisms has become increasingly important because of emerging resistance. we compared the activity of a new b-lactam antimicrobial agent, rwj-54428 (mc-02 479), with representatives of other classes of antimicrobial agents against 76 staphylococcus aureus (including four glycopeptide- intermediate strains), 50 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 20 enterococcus faecalis, 20 enterococcus faecium, 10 enterococcus gallinarum/enterococcus casseliflavus, 54 streptococcus  pneumoniae and 22 viridans streptococcal isolates. the mic(90) of rwj-54,428 was  < or = 2 mg/l for all groups of bacteria tested except e. faecium. the activity against four strains of glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus was similar to that for other methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (range 0.5-2.0 mg/l).

TI  == the duel study: a multi-center in vitro evaluation of linezolid compared with other antibiotics in the netherlands.
AB  == objective: to evaluate bacterial susceptibility to linezolid in the netherlands in comparison with other antibiotics. methods: bacterial strains were isolated between september 1999 and january 2000 from patients presumed to require antibiotic treatment. the in vitro activity of 1226 strains from 34 participating laboratories was tested against linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and other antibiotics against enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were obtained with the e test on mueller-hinton agar: every laboratory included control strains. for vancomycin and teicoplanin only, brain-heart infusion agar and an inoculum of 2.0 mcfarland  was used for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci to support a better growth and clear recognition of hetero-resistant  colonies. results: the values of mic90 for linezolid were 1.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci, respectively. six enterococcal strains with decreased susceptibility against vancomycin or teicoplanin were identified as enterococcus  faecium, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus (two strains each) and they were found to harbor vana, vanc1 and vanc2/3 genes, respectively. nine per cent of streptococcus pneumoniae (an increase from 1% 4 years ago) showed decreased susceptibility to erythromycin, of both the ermb and mefe type; there was no cross-resistance with linezolid. twelve coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were resistant to teicoplanin. conclusion: linezolid is a promising drug in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci. cross-resistance with other antibiotics tested was not found.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == [susceptibilities of enterococcus faecium, prsp and mrsa to rp59500 and their correlations with those to other drugs].
AB  == investigations on emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) which has recently been attracting attention, especially in the western countries, have been conducted in japan. a total of 1,239 isolates of e. faecium  were collected from 19 institutions during the period of april 1995 and june 1996, in the purpose of evaluating susceptibilities to variety of antimicrobial agents, including rp59500 and vancomycin (vcm), and detecting vancomycin-resistant genes (van genes). susceptibilities of penicillin-resistant  streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were also studied. as a result, 2 isolates of e. faecium were found to be  moderately resistant to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml though the final identification in species level and the detection of van genes by pcr method have not been completed. on the other hand there detected no mrsa nor prsp showing moderately resistant or resistant to vcm. it was concluded that rp59500 and vcm possessed favorable activity against clinically isolated e. faecium, prsp and mrsa. among other species of enterococci, moderately resistant strains to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml were detected; 10 isolates of e. gallinarum, 4 of  e. casseliflavus and 2 of e. flavescens. in those isolates, vanc1 and vanc2 were  detected by pcr, and vanb was also detected in a isolates of e. gallinarum simultaneously.

TI  == comparison of agar dilution, broth microdilution, e-test, disk diffusion, and automated vitek methods for testing susceptibilities of enterococcus spp. to vancomycin.
AB  == an evaluation was undertaken to determine the optimal method for testing the susceptibilities of 100 clinical isolates and two reference strains of enterococcus spp. to vancomycin in vitro. six testing methods were studied by using the following media and incubation times: agar screen with the synergy quad plate (remel, lenexa, kans.), an in-house-prepared brain heart infusion (bhi) agar plate, and an in-house-prepared mueller-hinton (mh) agar plate, all incubated for 24 or 48 h; broth microdilution (sensititre just one strip; accumed international, inc., west lake, ohio) with bhi or cation-adjusted mh broth incubated for 24 or 48 h; agar dilution with bhi or mh agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; epsilometer test (e test; ab biodisk, solna, sweden) with bhi or mh agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; disk diffusion with bhi or mh agar incubated for 24 or  48 h; and the automated vitek method with the gram-positive susceptibility staphylococcus aureus card and r02.03 software (biomerieux, inc., hazelwood, mo.). growth failures occurred with mh media (n = 6) but not with bhi media. one  growth failure occurred with the vitek method. results for each testing method for each enterococcus strain were interpreted as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according to current national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) criteria and compared to the vancomycin resistance genotype (i.e., vana, vanb, vanc-1, or vanc-2/3). for all methods, extension of the incubation time from 24 h to 48 h either produced no difference in the results or gave poorer results. the following methods produced no very major or major interpretive errors: broth microdilution with bhi media incubated for 24 h, agar  dilution with bhi media incubated for 24 or 48 h, and e test with bhi media incubated for 24 or 48 h. unacceptable frequencies of very major errors (> 1%) occurred with all methods for which mh media were used. minor interpretive errors were frequent with all methods. these minor interpretive errors also occurred most frequently with enterococcus strains with vanc genes, which encoded low-level vancomycin resistance (mic < or = 8 microg/ml), as opposed to enterococcus strains which possessed vana or vanb genes, which encoded higher-level vancomycin resistance (mic > or = 64 microg/ml). modification of nccls breakpoints, especially for motile enterococcus spp. (e. casseliflavus, e.  flavescens, and e. gallinarum), may resolve this problem; however, in the current study, one e. faecalis strain and one e. faecium strain carried only the vanc gene. the agar screen method may also require reformulation. the current agar screen plate contains 6 microg of vancomycin per ml, which may not detect all low-level resistance associated with vanc genotypes. nevertheless, the clinical significance of this low-level vancomycin resistance remains unknown.

TI  == semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
