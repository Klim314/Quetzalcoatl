TI  - Isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  - Endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. To clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. Based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16S rDNA full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: Bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), Staphlococcus aureus (33%), S. Epidermidis (75%), Micrococcus luteus (25%), Kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: Neisseria mucosa (58%), Streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: Enterococcus faecalis (17%), Lactococus lactis (33%), Escherichia coli (92%), Salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: S. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: N.mucosa (67%); anus: L. lactis (33%), E. coli (100%). These results indicate that S. epidermidis, N. mucosa, L. lactis and E. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, S. aureus, M. luteus, K. gibsonii, E. faecalis and S. typhosa were species-specific flora. This study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.
TI  - Crystal structure of the vitamin B3 transporter PnuC, a full-length SWEET homolog.
AB  - PnuC transporters catalyze cellular uptake of the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) and belong to a large superfamily that includes the SWEET sugar transporters. We present a crystal structure of Neisseria mucosa PnuC, which adopts a highly symmetrical fold with 3+1+3 membrane topology not previously observed in any protein. The high symmetry of PnuC with a single NR bound in the center suggests a simple alternating-access translocation mechanism.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - In vivo adaptation and persistence of Neisseria meningitidis within the nasopharyngeal mucosa.
AB  - Neisseria meningitidis (Nme) asymptomatically colonizes the human nasopharynx, yet can initiate rapidly-progressing sepsis and meningitis in rare instances. Understanding the meningococcal lifestyle within the nasopharyngeal mucosa, a phase of infection that is prerequisite for disease, has been hampered by the lack of animal models. Herein, we compare mice expressing the four different human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) that can bind the neisserial Opa protein adhesins, and find that expression of human CEACAM1 is necessary and sufficient to establish intranasal colonization. During infection, in vivo selection for phase variants expressing CEACAM1-specific Opa proteins occurs, allowing mucosal attachment and entry into the subepithelial space. Consistent with an essential role for Opa proteins in this process, Opa-deficient meningococci were unable to colonize the CEACAM1-humanized mice. While simple Opa-mediated attachment triggered an innate response regardless of meningococcal viability within the inoculum, persistence of viable Opa-expressing bacteria within the CEACAM1-humanized mice was required for a protective memory response to be achieved. Parenteral immunization with a capsule-based conjugate vaccine led to the accumulation of protective levels of Nme-specific IgG within the nasal mucus, yet the sterilizing immunity afforded by natural colonization was instead conferred by Nme-specific IgA without detectable IgG. Considered together, this study establishes that the availability of CEACAM1 helps define the exquisite host specificity of this human-restricted pathogen, displays a striking example of in vivo selection for the expression of desirable Opa variants, and provides a novel model in which to consider meningococcal infection and immunity within the nasopharyngeal mucosa.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of microbial biofilms in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to identify the bacterial spectra on the surface of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) in comparison to oral mucosa of patients with a higher risk to emerge an OSCC and a control group to determine their susceptibility to various common antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Swabs from 90 patients, 30 patients of each group, were cultured on media for aerobes and anaerobes and tested with agar diffusion and Etest. RESULTS: The predominant pathogens of the normal healthy oral mucosa were aerobes. The ratio between aerobes and anaerobes was 2:1, balanced in risk patients and inverted in the OSCC group. Altogether, 1,006 isolates were cultured. The most frequent strains were 47 viridans streptococci, 30 Staphylococcus species, 14 Enterococcus faecalis, 36 Neisseria species, 14 Escherichia coli, and 23 other aerobes, 66 Peptostreptococcus species, 39 Fusobacterium species, and 34 Prevotella species. The resistance rates in the OSCC group were penicillin 40%, ampicillin 57%, doxycycline 23%, clindamycin 47%, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 20%, but up to 100% of pathogens were susceptible to azithromycin, telithromycin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative anaerobes play a decisive role in the development of postoperative infections in patients with OSCC. This tumor special type of colonization does not agree with the normal flora of the oral cavity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Biofilms on OSCC surfaces provide an important reservoir for anaerobic bacteria. As a consequence, a proposal for an antibiotic prophylactic regime should be given.
TI  - Innate recognition by neutrophil granulocytes differs between Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains causing local or disseminating infections.
AB  - Members of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family serve as cellular receptors for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. More specifically, neisserial colony opacity (OpaCEA)) proteins bind to epithelial CEACAMs (CEACAM1, CEA, CEACAM6) to promote bacterial colonization of the mucosa. In contrast, recognition by CEACAM3, expressed by human granulocytes, results in uptake and destruction of Opa(CEA)-expressing bacteria. Therefore, CEACAM3-mediated uptake might limit the spread of gonococci. However, some strains can cause disseminating gonococcal infections (DGIs), and it is currently unknown how these strains escape detection by granulocyte CEACAM3. Therefore, the opa gene loci from N. gonorrhoeae strain VP1, which was derived from a patient with disseminated gonococcal disease, were cloned and constitutively expressed in Escherichia coli. Similar to Opa proteins of the nondisseminating strain MS11, the majority of Opa proteins from strain VP1 bound epithelial CEACAMs and promoted CEACAM-initiated responses by epithelial cells. In sharp contrast to the Opa proteins of strain MS11, the Opa proteins of strain VP1 failed to interact with the human granulocyte receptor CEACAM3. Accordingly, bacteria expressing VP1 Opa proteins were not taken up by primary human granulocytes and did not trigger a strong oxidative burst. Analysis of Opa variants from four additional clinical DGI isolates again demonstrated a lack of CEACAM3 binding. In summary, our results reveal that particular N. gonorrhoeae strains express an Opa protein repertoire allowing engagement of epithelial CEACAMs for successful mucosal colonization, while avoiding recognition and elimination via CEACAM3-mediated phagocytosis. A failure of CEACAM3-mediated innate immune detection might be linked to the ability of gonococci to cause disseminated infections.
TI  - Outer membrane biogenesis in Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, and Helicobacter pylori: paradigm deviations in H. pylori.
AB  - The bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori is capable of colonizing the gastric mucosa of the human stomach using a variety of factors associated with or secreted from its outer membrane (OM). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and numerous OM proteins have been shown to be involved in adhesion and immune stimulation/evasion. Many of these factors are essential for colonization and/or pathogenesis in a variety of animal models. Despite this wide array of potential targets present on the bacterial surface, the ability of H. pylori to vary its OM profile limits the effectiveness of vaccines or therapeutics that target any single one of these components. However, it has become evident that the proteins comprising the complexes that transport the majority of these molecules to the OM are highly conserved and often essential. The field of membrane biogenesis has progressed remarkably in the last few years, and the possibility now exists for targeting the mechanisms by which beta-barrel proteins, lipoproteins, and LPS are transported to the OM, resulting in loss of bacterial fitness and significant altering of membrane permeability. In this review, the OM transport machinery for LPS, lipoproteins, and outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are discussed. While the principal investigations of these transport mechanisms have been conducted in Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis, here these systems will be presented in the genetic context of epsilon proteobacteria. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that minimalist genomes, such as that of Helicobacter pylori, offer insight into the smallest number of components required for these essential pathways to function. Interestingly, in the majority of epsilon proteobacteria, while the inner and OM associated apparatus of LPS, lipoprotein, and OMP transport pathways appear to all be intact, most of the components associated with the periplasmic compartment are either missing or are almost unrecognizable when compared to their E. coli counterparts. Eventual targeting of these pathways would have the net effect of severely limiting the delivery/transport of components to the OM and preventing the bacterium's ability to infect its human host.
TI  - Suppression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in macrophages by  commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating Toll-like receptor 4.
AB  - Protection from primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has not yet been accomplished by vaccines inducing HIV-1-specific acquired immunity. Nevertheless, it has been reported that a small subgroup of women remain resistant to HIV-1 infection under natural conditions. If similar conditions can be induced in uninfected individuals, it will contribute the first line of protection against HIV-1 infection, and also improve the effects of anti-HIV-1 vaccines. We reasoned that innate immunity may be involved in the resistance to HIV-1 infection, and investigated the effects of various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and commensal bacteria on HIV-1 replication in macrophages, one of the initial targets of HIV-1 infection and also the main mediators of innate immunity. We established the HIV-1 reporter monocytic cell line, THP-1/NL4-3luc, which could be differentiated into macrophage-like cells in vitro. In these cells, stimulation of TLR3 and TLR4 by their ligands suppressed HIV-1 expression partly through type I interferon (IFN). Among the commensal bacteria tested, Escherichia coli, Veillonella parvula and Neisseria mucosa suppressed HIV-1 expression, whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella melaninogenica, P. bivia and Mycobacterium smegmatis enhanced it. The bacteria with suppressive effects preferentially stimulated TLR4, whereas the ones with enhancing effects stimulated TLR2. Neutralizing antibodies against TLR4 and IFN-alpha/beta receptor abrogated bacterially mediated HIV-1 suppression. Suppressive effects of E. coli, V. parvula and N. mucosa on HIV-1 replication were reproducible in primary monocyte-derived macrophages following acute HIV-1 infection. These findings suggest that certain commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating TLR4 potentially produce local environments resistant to HIV-1 infection.
TI  - [Construction, expression and immunocompetence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae porB and  Escherichia coli itB fusion gene].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct prokaryotic fusion gene expression vector pET-30a/ltB-porB, express the recombinant fusion protein LTB-PorB and analyze the immunocompetence of the recombinant fusion protein in female BALB/c mice through intranasally immunization. METHODS: B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LTB) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae Porin B (PorB) fusion gene, LTB gene and PorB gene were cloned into prokaryotic vector pET-30a. The recombinants were identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing, and then expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli BL21 in the form of inclusion bodies. The renatured recombinant proteins had antigenicity, which was confirmed by Western blot. Female BALB/c mice were inoculated with renatured recombinant proteins without endotoxin through intranasally immunization at the days 0, 14, 28. Next, humoral immunoresponse and cellullar immunologic response were detected in female BALB/c mice by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium( MTT) colorimetric assay. RESULTS: The level of PorB specific sIgA in genital tract and IgG in serum shown upward trend along with the days post innoculation in LTB-PorB group, A450 of sIgA in LTB-PorB group was 0.66 at the day 42, which was significantly higher than controls (P < 0.01), and the titer was up to 1:1280. A450 of serum IgG in LTB-PorB group was 0.60 at the day 28, which was significantly higher than the LTB and the Solution Buffer controls (P < 0.01), and the titer was up to 1:2560. However, the IgG between LTB-PorB group and PorB control (A450 :0.57) had no significant difference (P > 0.05). Stimulation index of the splenic lymphocyte in LTB-PorB group was significantly higher than the LTB and the Solution Buffer controls (P < 0.05). But the level of IFN-gamma induced by splenic lymphocyte between LTB-PorB group and controls had no significant difference (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The recombinant fusion protein LTB-PorB could induce high level of humoral immunoresponse and slightly cellullar immunologic response in female BALB/c mice through intranasally immunization. For the first time to our knowledge, the mucosal adjuvant LTB could assist PorB to induce high level of mucosal immune response in the genital tract mucosa of mice.
TI  - Intranasal immunization of mice with recombinant Streptococcus gordonii expressing NadA of Neisseria meningitidis induces systemic bactericidal antibodies and local IgA.
AB  - NadA and NhhA, two surface proteins of serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis identified as candidate vaccine antigens, were expressed on the surface of the human oral commensal bacterium Streptococcus gordonii. Recombinant strains were used to immunize BALB/c mice by the intranasal route and the local and systemic immune response was assessed. Mice were inoculated with recombinant bacteria administered alone or with LTR72, a partially inactivated mutant of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin, as a mucosal adjuvant. Intranasal immunization with live bacteria expressing NadA induced a significant serum antibody response, with a prevalence of the IgG2a subclass, bactericidal activity in the sera of 71% of animals, and a NadA-specific IgA response in nasal and bronchoalveolar lavages. A formalin-inactivated recombinant strain of S. gordonii expressing NadA was also administered intranasally, inducing a systemic and mucosal humoral response comparable to that of live bacteria. The administration of recombinant bacteria with the mucosal adjuvant LTR72 stimulated a stronger systemic antibody response, protective in 85% of sera, while did not increase the local IgA response. Recombinant S. gordonii expressing NhhA induced a systemic but not mucosal antibody response. These data support the role of NadA as vaccine candidate against serogroup B meningococci, and the use of S. gordonii as vector for intranasal vaccination.
TI  - The integration site of the iga gene in commensal Neisseria sp.
AB  - An IgA1 protease is produced by the human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, Neisseria species. In this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 and compared to corresponding loci in N. meningitidis and commensal Neisseria species. In N. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpB and ksgA were found immediately downstream of iga. In addition to comL and comA, a homolog of the Escherichia coli YFII gene was identified upstream of iga. Each gene in the iga region (YFII and comL, comA and iga, and trpB and ksgA) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. The comL/ comA and iga/ trpB pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. These terminators contain the common gonococcal DNA uptake sequence (DUS). A highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in N. gonorrhoeae was also found in N. meningitidis. In Southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal DNAs of the commensal species N. mucosa, N. lactamica, N. flavescens, N. cinerea, N. subflava, N. flava, N. sicca or N. elongata. When N. gonorrhoeae comL and trpB were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. This indicated that commensal Neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between comA and trpB. The region between comA and trpB was therefore amplified by PCR. The fragment obtained from N. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal comA and trpB, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology to any known gonococcal sequence. Our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. N. lactamica, which is more closely related to N. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.
TI  - VDAC and the bacterial porin PorB of Neisseria gonorrhoeae share mitochondrial import pathways.
AB  - The human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae induces host cell apoptosis during infection by delivering the outer membrane protein PorB to the host cell's mitochondria. PorB is a pore-forming beta-barrel protein sharing several features with the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which is involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Here we show that PorB of pathogenic Neisseria species produced by host cells is efficiently targeted to mitochondria. Imported PorB resides in the mitochondrial outer membrane and forms multimers with similar sizes as in the outer bacterial membrane. The mitochondria completely lose their membrane potential, a characteristic previously observed in cells infected with gonococci or treated with purified PorB. Closely related bacterial porins of non-pathogenic Neisseria mucosa or Escherichia coli remain in the cytosol. Import of PorB into mitochondria in vivo is independent of a linear signal sequence. Insertion of PorB into the mitochondrial outer membrane in vitro depends on the activity of Tom5, Tom20 and Tom40, but is independent of Tom70. Our data show that human VDAC and bacterial PorB are imported into mitochondria by a similar mechanism.
TI  - Specific entry of Helicobacter pylori into cultured gastric epithelial cells via  a zipper-like mechanism.
AB  - Although Helicobacter pylori has generally been considered an extracellular pathogen, a number of in vitro infection experiments and biopsy examinations have shown that it is capable of occasionally entering mammalian host cells. Here, we characterized this entry process by using AGS cells as a host cell model. In gentamicin protection-invasion assays, the number of H. pylori colonies recovered was lower than that for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium X22, Escherichia coli expressing InvA, and Yersinia enterocolitica YO:9 grown at 25 degrees C but higher than that for Neisseria gonorrhoeae VP1 and Y. enterocolitica YO:9 grown at 37 degrees C. At the ultrastructural level, the entry process was observed to occur via a zipper-like mechanism. Internalized H. pylori was bound in tight LAMP-1-containing vacuoles in close association with condensed filamentous actin and tyrosine phosphorylation signals. Wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and calphostin C, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, both inhibited the entry of H. pylori in a sensitive and dose-dependent manner; however, the level of entry was enhanced by sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases and ATPases. Furthermore, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonized the entry of H. pylori into AGS cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the entry of H. pylori into AGS cells occurs via a zipper-like mechanism which involves various host signal transduction events.
TI  - Diagnostics of neisseriaceae and moraxellaceae by ribosomal DNA sequencing: ribosomal differentiation of medical microorganisms.
AB  - Fast and reliable identification of microbial isolates is a fundamental goal of clinical microbiology. However, in the case of some fastidious gram-negative bacterial species, classical phenotype identification based on either metabolic, enzymatic, or serological methods is difficult, time-consuming, and/or inadequate. 16S or 23S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) bacterial sequencing will most often result in accurate speciation of isolates. Therefore, the objective of this study was to find a hypervariable rDNA stretch, flanked by strongly conserved regions, which is suitable for molecular species identification of members of the Neisseriaceae and Moraxellaceae. The inter- and intrageneric relationships were investigated using comparative sequence analysis of PCR-amplified partial 16S and 23S rDNAs from a total of 94 strains. When compared to the type species of the genera Acinetobacter, Moraxella, and Neisseria, an average of 30 polymorphic positions was observed within the partial 16S rDNA investigated (corresponding to Escherichia coli positions 54 to 510) for each species and an average of 11 polymorphic positions was observed within the 202 nucleotides of the 23S rDNA gene (positions 1400 to 1600). Neisseria macacae and Neisseria mucosa subsp. mucosa (ATCC 19696) had identical 16S and 23S rDNA sequences. Species clusters were heterogeneous in both genes in the case of Acinetobacter lwoffii, Moraxella lacunata, and N. mucosa. Neisseria meningitidis isolates failed to cluster only in the 23S rDNA subset. Our data showed that the 16S rDNA region is more suitable than the partial 23S rDNA for the molecular diagnosis of Neisseriaceae and Moraxellaceae and that a reference database should include more than one strain of each species. All sequence chromatograms and taxonomic and disease-related information are available as part of our ribosomal differentiation of medical microorganisms (RIDOM) web-based service (http://www.ridom.hygiene.uni-wuerzburg.de/). Users can submit a sequence and conduct a similarity search against the RIDOM reference database for microbial identification purposes.
TI  - Two glycosylase/abasic lyases from Neisseria mucosa that initiate DNA repair at sites of UV-induced photoproducts.
AB  - Diverse organisms ranging from Escherichia coli to humans contain a variety of DNA repair proteins that function in the removal of damage caused by shortwave UV light. This study reports the identification, purification, and biochemical characterization of two DNA glycosylases with associated abasic lyase activity from Neisseria mucosa. These enzymes, pyrimidine dimer glycosylase I and II (Nmu-pdg I and Nmu-pdg II), were purified 30,000- and 10,000-fold, respectively. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that Nmu-pdg I is approximately 30 kDa, whereas Nmu-pdg II is approximately 19 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of Nmu-pdg II exhibits 64 and 66% identity with E. coli and Hemophilus parainfluenzae endonuclease III, respectively. Both Nmu-pdg I and Nmu-pdg II were found to have broad substrate specificities, as evidenced by their ability to incise DNA containing many types of UV and some types of oxidative damage. Consistent with other glycosylase/abasic lyases, the existence of a covalent enzyme-DNA complex could be demonstrated for both Nmu-pdg I and II when reactions were carried out in the presence of sodium borohydride. These data indicate the involvement of an amino group in the catalytic reaction mechanism of both enzymes.
TI  - [Effect of piperacillin/tazobactam on the anti-infection resistance in patients with infections in the peritoneal cavity].
AB  - The effect of the monotherapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) or tazocin on microflora of the mucous membranes of the nose and pharynx of 33 patients and the contents of the large intestine of 21 patients as well as on the immunological aspects (cellular and humoral factors) of the antiinfectious resistance systems (AIRS) in patients with abdominal cavity infection (ACI) was studied. Before the treatment serious impairment of the AIRS in all the patients was observed. The P/T monotherapy in a daily dose of 12/1.5 g at the average for 10 days had no unfavourable effect on the indices characterizing the phagocytic function of the neutrophils in the incompleted and completed variants, on the immunocompetent cells, hemolytic complement and the levels of IgM, IgG and IgA. No significant effect of the treatment on the mucosal microflora on the whole was detected. However, Neisseria spp. and Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum were eradicated in the pharynx while the number of the Klebsiella pneumoniae [symbol: see text] Escherichia coli isolates from the pharynx mucosa increased. The number of the bifidobacteria in the contents of the large intestine significantly lowered while the number of the hemolyzing forms of enterococci and stapylococci increased. The investigation of the AIRS immunological aspects in the patient groups of different total (clinicomorphological) efficacy showed that the neutrophil phagocytic function was the efficacy predictor and P/T in its turn had an immunomodulating effect on the neutrophil phagocytic activity in the patients with ACI.
TI  - Anti-alpha-galactosyl immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, and IgM in human secretions.
AB  - Anti-alpha-galactosyl (anti-Gal) is a natural human serum antibody that binds to  the carbohydrate Gal alpha 1,3Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc-R (alpha-galactosyl epitope) and is synthesized by 1% of circulating B lymphocytes in response to immune stimulation by enteric bacteria. We were able to purify secretory anti-Gal from human colostrum and bile by affinity chromatography on silica-linked Gal alpha 1,3Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc. We found similar secretory anti-Gal antibodies in human milk, saliva, and vaginal washings. Secretory anti-Gal from milk and saliva was exclusively immunoglobulin A (IgA); that from colostrum and bile also contained IgG and IgM isotypes. Serum was also found to contain anti-Gal IgM and IgA in addition to the previously reported IgG. Anti-Gal IgA purified from colostrum and bile had both IgA1 and IgA2. Secretory anti-Gal from saliva, milk, colostrum, and bile agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes (RRBC) and bound to bovine thyroglobulin, both of which have abundant alpha-galactosyl epitopes. The RRBC-hemagglutinating capacity of human saliva, milk, bile, and serum was specifically adsorbed by immobilized Gal alpha 1,3Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc but not by Gal alpha 1,4Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc, Gal beta 1,3GalNAc, Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc, Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc alpha 1,2Man, or Fuc alpha 1,2Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc. No RRBC-hemagglutinating activity could be detected in rat milk, rat bile, cow milk, or rabbit bile, suggesting a restricted species distribution for secretory anti-Gal similar to that found for serum anti-Gal. Colostral anti-GaI IgA bound strongly to a sample of gram-negative bacteria isolated from the throats and stools of well children as well as to an Escherichia coli K-1 blood isolate. Colostral anti-GaI IgA inhibited the binding of a Neisseria meningitidis strain to human buccal epithelial cells, suggesting that this antibody may play a protective role at the mucosal surface.
TI  - Binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  - Mannan-binding protein (MBP), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. After binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, MBP activates the classical pathway of the complement system. To investigate the binding capacity of MBP to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of MBP to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. Salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), used as a positive control strain, showed binding of radiolabelled MBP at a level of 80% compared with binding of MBP to zymosan. Binding of labelled MBP to Salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. The binding was inhibited by unlabelled MBP, by mannose and by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of MBP binding capacities could be determined. The encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group A were included: n = 22), N. mucosa (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low MBP binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-40.1%). Escherichia coli K1 (n = 11), Strep. suis (n = 5), Strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and N. meningitidis serogroup A (n = 2) showed intermediate MBP binding capacity of 58.4% (95% CI 40.0-76.8%). A third group consisting of non-encapsulated Listeria monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated H. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated N. meningitidis (n = 2), N. cinera (n = 1) and N. subflava (n = 1) strains had a high MBP binding capacity of 87.5% (95% CI 62.5-112.5%). The majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low MBP binding capacity.
TI  - Molecular mechanisms of interaction of mucosal pathogens with human mucosal surfaces.

TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - A histochemical and ultrastructural study of human urethral uroepithelium.
AB  - The ultrastructure and histochemistry of the human urethral mucosa was studied. By scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) the cover cell of the urethra was found to be polygonal and with a surface topography characterized by numerous microvilli and micro-ridges. By transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) the cover cells were shown to be interconnected with tight junctions but to lack the asymmetric luminal membrane and the fusiform vacuoles that characterize urothelium above the bladder neck. Histochemical analyses showed the human urethral cells to harbour large amounts of glycogen, and the glycocalyx facing the urethral lumen displayed high affinity for alcian blue and colloidal iron, indicating the presence of acid mucopolysaccharides. The reactivity with alcian blue appeared at pH 2.5, but was abolished by pre-treatment with sialidase. Studies with TEM or using SEM with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) confirmed the high content of acid mucopolysaccharides in the luminal glycocalyx of the cover cells by demonstrating high binding capacity for ruthenium red. The quantitative binding of ruthenium red was not influenced by pH shifts between 4.5 and 7.5. Utilizing the SEM + EDX technique, small variations in quantity of negative charge (i.e. of bound ruthenium red) were detected within individual cover cells, but considerable variations were found between cells. The significance of these physicochemical properties of the human urethral lining is discussed with special reference to the previously demonstrated liability of this mucosal surface to interact with microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

AB  - A quantitative research into the aerobic bacteria of human nasal cavities has been carried out; 183 healthy individuals observed, negative results 18 (9.83%). Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria, were numerically determined and the incidence of each single species or genus exactly specified. Among gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter, Providencia, Proteus, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia, Herella, Pseudomonas, and among the Hyphomycetes, Candida albicans have been identified and their number calculated. Diphteroid bacteria were also detected and counted; among them, the Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum seemed to be the most frequent and numerous species. Finally, interference phenomena in vivo by Staphylococcus aureus and environmental and nourishment competition by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus and Diphtheroids were noted.
