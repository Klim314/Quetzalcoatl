TI  == the abi proteins and their involvement in bacteriocin self-immunity.
AB  == the abi protein family consists of putative membrane-bound metalloproteases. while they are involved in membrane anchoring of proteins in eukaryotes, little is known about their function in prokaryotes. in some known bacteriocin loci, abi genes have been found downstream of bacteriocin structural genes (e.g., pln locus from lactobacillus plantarum and sag locus from streptococcus pyogenes), where they probably are involved in self-immunity. by modifying the profile hidden markov model used to select abi proteins in the pfam protein family database, we  show that this family is larger than presently recognized. using bacteriocin-associated abi genes as a means to search for novel bacteriocins in sequenced genomes, seven new bacteriocin-like loci were identified in gram-positive bacteria. one such locus, from lactobacillus sakei 23k, was selected for further experimental study, and it was confirmed that the bacteriocin-like genes (skkab) exhibited antimicrobial activity when expressed in a heterologous host and that the associated abi gene (skki) conferred immunity against the cognate bacteriocin. similar investigation of the abi gene plni and the abi-like gene plnl from l. plantarum also confirmed their involvement in immunity to their cognate bacteriocins (plnef and plnjk, respectively). interestingly, the immunity genes from these three systems conferred a high degree of cross-immunity against each other's bacteriocins, suggesting the recognition of a common receptor. site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the conserved motifs constituting the putative proteolytic active site of the abi proteins are essential for the immunity function of skki, and to our knowledge, this represents a new concept in self-immunity.

TI  == macedocin, a food-grade lantibiotic produced by streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc  198.
AB  == streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198, a strain isolated from greek kasseri cheese, produces a food-grade lantibiotic named macedocin. macedocin has a molecular mass of 2,794.76 +/- 0.42 da, as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. partial n-terminal sequence analysis revealed 22 amino acid residues that correspond with the amino acid sequence of the lantibiotics sa-ff22 and sa-m49, both of which were isolated from the pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. macedocin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, as well as several food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, including clostridium tyrobutyricum. it displays a bactericidal effect towards the most sensitive indicator strain, lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei lmg 13558(t), while the producer strain itself displays autoinhibition when it is grown under conditions that do not favor bacteriocin production. macedocin is active at phs between 4.0 and 9.0, and it retains activity even after incubation for 20 min at 121 degrees c with 1 atm of  overpressure. inhibition of macedocin by proteolytic enzymes is variable.

TI  == clpe, a novel type of hsp100 atpase, is part of the ctsr heat shock regulon of bacillus subtilis.
AB  == clp atpases, which include the ubiquitous hsp100 family, are classified according to their structural features and sequence similarities. during the course of the  bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we identified a gene encoding a new  member of the hsp100 family. we designated this protein clpe, as it is the prototype of a novel subfamily among the clp atpases, and have identified homologues in several bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus sakei and clostridium acetobutylicum. a unique feature of these hsp100-type clp atpases is their amino-terminal zinc finger motif. unlike the other class iii genes of b. subtilis (clpc and clpp ), clpe does not appear to be required for stress tolerance. transcriptional analysis revealed two sigmaa-type promoters, expression from which was shown to be inducible by heat shock and puromycin treatment. investigation of the regulatory mechanism controlling clpe expression  indicates that this gene is controlled by ctsr and is thus a member of the class  iii heat shock genes of b. subtilis. ctsr negatively regulates clpe expression by binding to the promoter region, in which five ctsr binding sites were identified  through dnase i footprinting and sequence analysis.
