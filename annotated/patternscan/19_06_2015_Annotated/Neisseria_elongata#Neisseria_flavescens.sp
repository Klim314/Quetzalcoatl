TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == a numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of the genus neisseria.
AB  == a numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of 315 strains of neisseria and some allied bacteria examined for 155 phenotypic tests showed 31 groups, most of which were reasonably distinct. these fell into four major areas. areas a, b and c contained species of neisseria, whereas area d contained the organisms known as 'false neisserias' together with branhamella, moraxella and kingella species. area a contained n. gonorrhoeae (which showed two subgroups), n. meningitidis (with two subgroups, and n. cinerea closely associated), n. polysaccharea, n. elongata subsp, glycolytica and n. lactamica. area b contained mainly organisms from the human nasopharynx, and the nine groups were not very distinct: only three, n. mucosa, n. perflava and n. sicca could be recognized by the presence of type strains, and there was little relationship between taxonomic position and species epithets. area c contained several groups from animals, n. animalis, n. canis and two phenons that may be justified as new species of neisseria, one from lizards and the other from dental plaque of herbivores. area c also contained n.  elongata, n. subflava (with n. flavescens), type strain of morococcus cerebrosis  and the cdc groups m-5 (n. weaveri) and ef-4. area d contained branhamella catarrhalis, a combined group which consists of strains of the 'false neisserias' n. caviae and n. cuniculi, the 'false neisseria' n. ovis, and a group of moraxella strains. a small group representing kingella kingae is included in area d. mean test error was 1.7%.

TI  == neisseria weaveri sp. nov., formerly cdc group m-5, a gram-negative bacterium associated with dog bite wounds.
AB  == cdc group m-5 is a rod-shaped, gram-negative, nonmotile bacterium associated with dog bite wounds. dna-dna relatedness and biochemical and growth characteristics were studied for 54 strains from the collection at the centers for disease control and prevention. one typical m-5 strain, 8142, was further studied by 16s  rrna sequencing. dna from 40 of 53 strains showed 82 to 100% relatedness (hydroxyapatite method) to labeled dna from strain 8142. the guanine-plus-cytosine (g + c) content in 8 of the 41 highly related m-5 strains was 50.5 to 52 mol%. these 41 strains were oxidase and catalase positive, nonfermentative, nitrite positive, nitrate negative, weakly phenylalanine deaminase positive, aerobic, and alpha-hemolytic (sheep blood). dna from the 13 remaining strains showed only 7 to 46% dna relatedness to strain 8142. these 13 non-m-5 strains differed from the m-5 strains in g + c content, growth characteristics, and biochemical profiles. dna from m-5 strain 8142 was most closely related to dna from groups ef-4b (47%) and ef-4a (45%). 16s rrna sequence analysis placed m-5 strain 8142 in the neisseriaceae cluster of the beta-3 subgroup of the class proteobacteria. it was most homologous (98.4 to 98.8%) to neisseria animalis, neisseria flavescens, neisseria canis, and neisseria elongata. all data are consistent with m-5 being a new species of neisseria, for  which we propose the name neisseria weaveri.

TI  == phylogeny of species in the family neisseriaceae isolated from human dental plaque and description of kingella oralis sp. nov [corrected].
AB  == fourteen human periodontal isolates recovered from a purported eikenella corrodens-selective medium containing 1 microgram of clindamycin per ml displayed biochemical traits which differed from those described for e. corrodens. these organisms were gram-negative rods which corroded agar. the isolates were oxidase  positive and urease, indole, and esculin negative. they differed from e. corrodens in catalase, nitrate reduction, lysine decarboxylase, and ornithine decarboxylase activities. one isolate, strain ub-294, was presumptively identified as kingella denitrificans. a second isolate, strain ub-204, differed from e. corrodens by being catalase positive and nitrate reduction negative. twelve isolates, including strain ub-38t (t = type strain), were phenotypically similar to kingella kingae except that they did not produce acid from maltose and were not beta-hemolytic. essentially complete (1,480-base) 16s rrna sequences were determined for strains ub-38t, ub-204, and ub-294 and the type strains of neisseria animalis, neisseria canis, neisseria denitrificans, neisseria elongata, neisseria flavescens, neisseria macaca, and neisseria polysaccharea. these sequences were compared with the previously published sequences of six other species belonging to the family neisseriaceae. on the basis of the results of the comparative sequence analysis, ub-294 was confirmed as a k. denitrificans strain, ub-204 was identified as a member of a new species which may belong in the genus  eikenella, and ub-38t was identified as a member of a new species of the genus kingella, for which we propose the name kingella oralis [corrected]. since strain ub-204 was the only representative of a new species, it was not named.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the systematic serology of neisseria gonorrhoeae: antigens associated with pathogenesis in neisseria spp. from man.
AB  == sonicates of eight neisseria species from man were analysed in a micro-ouchterlony double-diffusion absorption assay in comparison with a gonococcal reference antiserum-antigen system. five major gonococcal precipitin zones were identified which comprised genus-, species- and type-specific components. one antigen was found in all strains of three species with pathogenic capability--n. gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis and n. flavescens. it was not detected in n. lactamica, n. pharyngis, n. elongata, n. cinerea or n. catarrhalis.

TI  == cellular monosaccharide patterns of neisseriaceae.
AB  == sixty-four strains of neisseria, moraxella, and acinetobacter were screened for cellular monosaccharides by gas-liquid chromatography and other chromatographic techniques. the four sugars ribose, glucose, glucosamine, and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (kdo) were detected in all strains. heptose was detected only in "true neisseriae" (neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, n. sicca, n. cinerea, n. flavescens, and n. elongata) and in the tentaively named species moraxella urethralis. some marked interspecies dissimilarities within groups were revealed. thus, n. ovis and m. atlantae were characterized by the presence of mannose. intraspecies differences were also encountered. n. meningitidis strains  of serogroups b and c were distinguished from strains of serogroup a by their sialic acid content. this sugar was also detected in two out of three examined strains of m. nonliquefaciens. in acinetobacter, heterogeneity of monosaccharide  patterns was rather pronounced. the results show the applicability of gas chromatographic "monosaccharide" profiles fo whole cells or extracted carbohydrate in bacterial classification and identification, including differentiation at the subspecies level. in addition, such profiles may be useful for monitoring during purification of cellular polysaccharides.
