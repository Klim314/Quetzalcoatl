TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria during fermentation of a traditional Chinese fish product, Chouguiyu (stinky mandarinfish).
AB  - Chouguiyu, or stinky mandarinfish, is a traditional Chinese fermented fish product made of mandarinfish by spontaneous fermentation at the anaerobic condition with low-salt concentration. In order to get a primary understanding of the microbial community presenting in the Chouguiyu fermentation, 61 cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from various fermentation period were isolated using MRS agar plates and characterized based on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches including amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and 16S rRNA partial gene sequencing analysis. Eight distinct bacterial species belonging to 6 genera were identified in total. Among them, Lactobacillus sakei was the dominant species (63%) during the fermentation, which exhibited great variety in phenotypic tests but unique genotypic characters. Meanwhile, the other LAB species including Lactococcus (Lc.) garvieae, Lc. lactis, Lc. raffinolactis, Vagococcus sp., Enterococcus hermanniensis, Macrococcus caseolyticus as well as Streptococcus parauberis were also recovered from the different fermentation periods, especially at the initial point of the fermentation. This seems to be the 1st report investigating the LAB composition involved in Chouguiyu fermentation and the data obtained in this study may be valuable for selecting starter culture for Chouguiyu industrial-scale production.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected standard strains of lactic acid bacteria producing bacteriocins--pilot study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this paper, an attempt was made to evaluate the antibacterial potential of standard strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) producing bacteriocins of various classes, thus demonstrating various mechanisms of cell membrane damages against the Streptococcus agalactiae strains (Group B Streptococcus, GBS), depending on surface polysaccharides and surface alpha-like protein genes. MATERIALS/METHODS: Antimicrobial property of the strains of L. plantarum C 11, L. sakei DSMZ 6333, and L. lactis ATCC 11454 producing bacteriocins: JK and EF plantaricins, sakacin and nisin, respectively, against the GBS strains was evaluated. The chosen to the study GBS strains were represented by serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, V and they had bca, epsilon, rib, alp2 or alp3 alpha-like protein genes. The experiment was conducted by means of suspension culture and the bacteria count was determined using the serial dilution method. RESULTS: A great ability of L. plantarum C 11 strain was proven to inhibit the GBS growth. The strain of L. sakei DSMZ 6333 did not demonstrate any ability to inhibit the growth of GBS, whereas L. lactis ATCC 11454 inhibited the growth of S. agalactiae indicator strains to a minor extent. Statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the GBS strains representing various serotypes against the antimicrobial activity of model LAB strains. The least sensitive to the activity of bacteriocins were the strains representing serotypes Ib and III, whereas the strains representing serotype II were the most sensitive. The sensitivity of the GBS strains to the antimicrobial activity of LAB was not dependent on alpha-like protein genes. DISCUSSION: Among the LAB standard strains producing bacteriocins, the strongest antimicrobial property was observed in the strain of L. plantarum C 11. Because of the generally known and verified strong antagonistic property of the strains of L. plantarum species against indicator bacteria, it is necessary to further pursue the research presented in this paper.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against Campylobacter.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control Campylobacter and Salmonella in live poultry. This finding is of relevance since Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. In the present work, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the cecum of twenty Tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against Campylobacter were further characterized. Following their preliminary confirmation as LAB, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16S- 23S PCR, specific lactobacilli PCR, and a biphasic approach. Most of the LAB isolated belonged to the genus Lactobacillus, among them Lb. sakei (33.3%), Lb. salivarius (19.4%), Lb. reuteri (8.6%), and Lb. curvatus (8.6%). The other LAB strains included those of the genus Weissella (16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), Lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and Streptococcus sp. (2.7%). The Lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against C. jejuni and C. coli. The activity of three of them, Lb. salivarius SMXD51, Lb. salivarius MMS122, and Lb. salivarius MMS151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.
TI  - Coexpression of the superoxide dismutase and the catalase provides remarkable oxidative stress resistance in Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally sensitive to oxidative stress caused by  reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antioxidant enzymes, especially superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), can protect against ROS by eliminating superoxide and H(2)O(2), respectively. Lactobacillus rhamnosus is a valuable probiotic starter culture but is deficient in both SOD and CAT, and is thus likely to suffer from oxidative stress in industrial fermentation. To confer high level of oxidative resistance on L. rhamnosus , the SOD gene sodA from Streptococcus thermophilus and CAT gene katA from L. sakei were coexpressed in L. rhamnosus AS 1.2466. The enzyme activities of SOD and CAT were 147.80 +/- 1.08 U/mg protein and 2.53 mumol of H(2)O(2) /min/10(8) cfu, respectively, in the recombinant L. rhamnosus CS. After incubation with 10 mM H(2)O(2), the survival ratio of L. rhamnosus CS was 400-fold higher than that of L. rhamnosus CAT. In long-term aerated conditions, viable cells of L. rhamnosus CS remained approximately 10(6) cfu/mL after incubation for 7 days, while no living cells of the control were detected. These results showed that the cooperation between SOD and CAT could significantly enhance oxidative resistance in L. rhamnosus . To our best knowledge, this is the first report of two synergistic antioxidant genes being coexpressed in the same Lactobacilli.
TI  - Lactobacillus sakei BK19 enriched diet enhances the immunity status and disease resistance to streptococcosis infection in kelp grouper, Epinephelus bruneus.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus sakei BK19 (10(8) cells g(-1)) supplemented diet fed  to kelp grouper, Epinephelus bruneus against streptococcosis caused by Streptococcus iniae and Streptococcus parauberis with reference to the innate immune response and disease resistance was evaluated at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Maximum reduction in mortalities was observed in kelper feeding the probiotic diet for two weeks after challenged with the pathogens when compared to the infected group fed with basal diet; similarly the cellular and humoral immune responses such as head kidney macrophage phagocytic and peroxidase activities, serum lysozyme activity, and total protein levels increased significantly. The results reveal that, in streptococcosis infected kelp grouper feeding L. sakei BK19 enriched diet affords a higher level of disease protection due to stimulation of immune system.
TI  - The abi proteins and their involvement in bacteriocin self-immunity.
AB  - The Abi protein family consists of putative membrane-bound metalloproteases. While they are involved in membrane anchoring of proteins in eukaryotes, little is known about their function in prokaryotes. In some known bacteriocin loci, Abi genes have been found downstream of bacteriocin structural genes (e.g., pln locus from Lactobacillus plantarum and sag locus from Streptococcus pyogenes), where they probably are involved in self-immunity. By modifying the profile hidden Markov model used to select Abi proteins in the Pfam protein family database, we show that this family is larger than presently recognized. Using bacteriocin-associated Abi genes as a means to search for novel bacteriocins in sequenced genomes, seven new bacteriocin-like loci were identified in Gram-positive bacteria. One such locus, from Lactobacillus sakei 23K, was selected for further experimental study, and it was confirmed that the bacteriocin-like genes (skkAB) exhibited antimicrobial activity when expressed in a heterologous host and that the associated Abi gene (skkI) conferred immunity against the cognate bacteriocin. Similar investigation of the Abi gene plnI and the Abi-like gene plnL from L. plantarum also confirmed their involvement in immunity to their cognate bacteriocins (PlnEF and PlnJK, respectively). Interestingly, the immunity genes from these three systems conferred a high degree of cross-immunity against each other's bacteriocins, suggesting the recognition of a common receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the conserved motifs constituting the putative proteolytic active site of the Abi proteins are essential for the immunity function of SkkI, and to our knowledge, this represents a new concept in self-immunity.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus sakei R1333 isolated  from smoked salmon.
AB  - Strain R1333, isolated from commercially available smoked salmon, was identified  as Lactobacillus sakei based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (API 50 CHL), PCR with species-specific primers and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Strain R1333 produces a 3811 kDa class IIa bacteriocin, active against Streptococcus caprinus, Streptococcus macedonicus, Streptococcus spp., L. sakei, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Listeria innocua, Listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and Listeria monocytogenes. The mode of activity against L. innocua 2030C and L. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii ATCC 19119 was bactericidal, resulting in cell lysis and enzyme- and DNA-leakage. The highest level of activity (1600 AU/mL) was recorded when cells were grown at 30 degrees C in MRS broth (initial pH 6.5). Only 800 AU/mL was recorded when strain R1333 was grown in MRS without Tween 80. Lower levels of bacteriocin production were recorded when strain R1333 was grown in MRS at 20 degrees C. Peptide R1333 adsorbs at low levels (200 AU/mL) to producer cells. Purification of bacteriocin R1333 was performed by 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by separation on a SepPak C(18) column and reverse-phase HPLC on a Nucleosil C(18) column with a linear gradient from 0.1% TFA to 90% acetonitryl. A molecular mass of 3811 kDa was determined by mass spectrometry. Based on mass spectrometry and sequencing of the PCR amplified fragment targeting the sakG gene, L. sakei R1333 is a potential producer of sakacin G. This is the first report of the identification of sakacin G produced by L. sakei isolated from smoked salmon.
TI  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 increases lactacin B production when it senses live target bacteria.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. Production of bacteriocin by L. acidophilus La-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. However, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. This study demonstrates that L. acidophilus La-5 produces lactacin B and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide IP_1800. The transcript level of the lactacin B gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between L. acidophilus La-5 and S. thermophilus STY-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene (lbaB) transcription was observed. However, lbaB was transcribed constitutively in uninduced L. acidophilus La-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. A new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced L. acidophilus La-5. These results showed that part of lactacin B secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.
TI  - Method for reliable isolation of Lactobacillus sakei strains originating from Tunisian seafood and meat products.
AB  - In Tunisia, several food products derived from meat or seafood are naturally processed, without any addition of bacterial starters. Such fermented, dried-cured, salted, or marinated products, as well as the raw meat or fish may thus provide a source to isolate the natural microflora colonizing such environments. We isolated lactic acid bacteria from a representative range of flesh-foods sold or manufactured in different parts of Tunisia, and selectively searched for Lactobacillus sakei, a lactic acid bacterium potentially useful as starter or protective culture. Eighty six (86) strains were isolated from various seafood (anchovy, sardine, sole, mullet, and octopus), or meat (pork, veal, beef, sheep, chicken, and turkey) products that were either fresh, or transformed by different traditional processes. Several methods were used in order to develop a rapid and reliable protocol for the direct identification of L. sakei. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) classified the various isolates into 9 distinct groups. Search for the presence of the L. sakei specific katA gene indicated that all positive isolates were grouped in the same ARDRA group. Sequencing of 16S rDNA confirmed those isolates as L. sakei. Those 22 different L. sakei strains represent 25.6% of the total isolates, while other isolates found in the different ARDRA groups were tentatively ascribed to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis/garviae, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus parauberis, Hafnia alvei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Lactobacillus curvatus through 16S rDNA sequencing. A fast and reliable method to isolate and discriminate L. sakei from complex food environments is proposed.
TI  - Optimization of conditions for profiling bacterial populations in food by culture-independent methods.
AB  - In this study we used culture-independent methods to profile bacterial populations in food products. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were employed in order to identify bacterial species without the need of isolation and biochemical identification. The protocols used to extract the DNA, subsequently subjected to PCR amplification for DGGE, as well as the hybridization procedure for FISH, were optimised. Moreover, an extensive study on the primers and probes to be used for the direct detection and identification of microorganisms commonly found in food, was carried out. Meat and cheese samples, fresh or processed, were subjected to DGGE and FISH analysis and the results obtained highlighted how the processing in food industry is decreasing the bacterial biodiversity. Not only processed cheese or meat but also fermented products were dominated by only one or few species. Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus and Brochothrix thermosphacta were the main species found in meat products, while in cheese(s) Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Leuconostoc spp. were repeatedly detected. The results obtained by the two culture-independent methods used always correlated well.
TI  - Parameters affecting the adsorption of plantaricin 423, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum 423 isolated from sorghum beer.
AB  - Plantaricin 423 is bactericidal to logarithmic and stationary-phase cells of Enterococcus sp. HKLHS and L. sakei DSM 20017. Detection of extracellular DNA and beta-galactosidase suggests that the mode of action is most probably by destabilizing of the cell membrane. Adsorption of plantaricin 423 to target cells ranged from 17% for Streptococcus caprinus ATCC 700066 to 67% for Lactobacillus plantarum LMG 13556, Lactobacillus curvatus DF38, Listeria innocua LMG 13568 and Lactobacillus sakei DSM 20017. Treatment of Enterococcus sp. HKLHS and L. sakei DSM 20017 with Triton X-100, Triton X-114 and chloroform increased the adsorption of plantaricin.
TI  - Use of unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks for the identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
AB  - Conventional multivariate statistical techniques (hierarchical cluster analysis,  linear discriminant analysis) and unsupervised (Kohonen Self Organizing Map) and supervised (Bayesian network) artificial neural networks were compared for as tools for the classification and identification of 352 SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins of lactic acid bacteria belonging to 22 species of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Lactococcus and Streptococcus including 47 reference strains. Electrophoretic data were pre-treated using the logistic weighting function described by Piraino et al. [Piraino, P., Ricciardi, A., Lanorte, M. T., Malkhazova, I., Parente, E., 2002. A new procedure for data reduction in electrophoretic fingerprints of whole-cell proteins. Biotechnol. Lett. 24, 1477-1482]. Hierarchical cluster analysis provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns but was unable to discriminate some species (Leuconostoc, Lb. sakei/Lb. curvatus, Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus, Lb. plantarum/Lb. paraplantarum, Lc. lactis/Lc. raffinolactis). A 7x7 Kohonen self-organizing map (KSOM), trained with the patterns of the reference strains, provided a satisfactory classification of the patterns and was able to discriminate more species than hierarchical cluster analysis. The map was used in predictive mode to identify unknown strains and provided results which in 85.5% of cases matched the classification obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis. Two supervised tools, linear discriminant analysis and a 23:5:2 Bayesian network were proven to be highly effective in the discrimination of SDS-PAGE patterns of Lc. lactis from those of other species. We conclude that data reduction by logistic weighting coupled to traditional multivariate statistical analysis or artificial neural networks provide an effective tool for the classification and identification of lactic acid bacteria on the basis of SDS-PAGE patterns of whole cell proteins.
TI  - Isolation of constitutive variants of a subfamily 10 histidine protein kinase (SppK) from Lactobacillus using random mutagenesis.
AB  - The histidine protein kinase SppK is a peptide pheromone-activated kinase that regulates the production of the bacteriocin sakacin P in Lactobacillus sakei. SppK belongs to subfamily 10 of histidine protein kinases (HPKs), which regulate important processes in Gram-positive bacteria, including virulence, competence and bacteriocin production. To obtain insight into the functional properties of this relatively unknown class of HPKs, we have subjected SppK to random mutagenesis by error-prone PCR, followed by selection for mutants displaying a constitutive phenotype. Most identified mutations were clustered in a predicted coiled coil-like region, which is an important part of the HPK dimer interface and which includes the autophosphorylated histidine. Other mutations were located in the junctions between the dimerization domain and the membrane receptor domain or the catalytic kinase domain. Interestingly, two previously identified constitutive variants of ComD, an SppK homologue involved in competence regulation in Streptococcus pneumoniae, contained single mutations in the same regions.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - Identification of the DNA-binding site of the Rgg-like regulator LasX within the  lactocin S promoter region.
AB  - LasX regulates the transcription of the divergent operons lasXY and lasA-W, which specify the production of lactocin S in Lactobacillus sakei L45. Using histidine-tagged LasX, and a DNA fragment containing the complete intergenic lasA-lasX region, electrophoresis mobility-shift (EMSA) analyses were employed to demonstrate that LasX binds to the lasA-lasX intergenic DNA. Two direct heptanucleotide motifs directly upstream of P(lasA-W), and a third imperfect copy of this motif, overlapping the -10 element of P(lasA-W), were identified as possible LasX-binding sites. To assess the role of the direct repeats in the binding of LasX to the intergenic lasA-lasX region, binding experiments were performed using DNA probes with different combinations of the repeats, and with arbitrarily chosen repeat substitutions. The result of these experiments demonstrated that only the middle repeat was required for the binding of LasX to the las-promoter region. This observation correlated with the results of subsequent reporter-gene analyses, thereby weakening the hypothesis of the involvement of the direct repeats in LasX-mediated transcription regulation. By analysing the ability of LasX to bind successively shortened derivatives of the original intergenic fragment, a tentative 19 bp minimum LasX-binding site was identified.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Glucan synthesis in the genus Lactobacillus: isolation and characterization of glucansucrase genes, enzymes and glucan products from six different strains.
AB  - Members of the genera Streptococcus and Leuconostoc synthesize various alpha-glucans (dextran, alternan and mutan). In Lactobacillus, until now, the only glucosyltransferase (GTF) enzyme that has been characterized is gtfA of Lactobacillus reuteri 121, the first GTF enzyme synthesizing a glucan (reuteran) that contains mainly alpha-(1-->4) linkages together with alpha-(1-->6) and alpha-(1-->4,6) linkages. Recently, partial sequences of glucansucrase genes were detected in other members of the genus Lactobacillus. This paper reports, for the first time, isolation and characterization of dextransucrase and mutansucrase genes and enzymes from various Lactobacillus species and the characterization of the glucan products synthesized, which mainly have alpha-(1-->6)- and alpha-(1-->3)-glucosidic linkages. The four GTF enzymes characterized from three different Lb. reuteri strains are highly similar at the amino acid level, and consequently their protein structures are very alike. Interestingly, these four Lb. reuteri GTFs have relatively large N-terminal variable regions, containing RDV repeats, and relatively short putative glucan-binding domains with conserved and less-conserved YG-repeating units. The three other GTF enzymes, isolated from Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus parabuchneri, contain smaller variable regions and larger putative glucan-binding domains compared to the Lb. reuteri GTF enzymes.
TI  - Macedocin, a food-grade lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC  198.
AB  - Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198, a strain isolated from Greek Kasseri cheese, produces a food-grade lantibiotic named macedocin. Macedocin has a molecular mass of 2,794.76 +/- 0.42 Da, as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry. Partial N-terminal sequence analysis revealed 22 amino acid residues that correspond with the amino acid sequence of the lantibiotics SA-FF22 and SA-M49, both of which were isolated from the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Macedocin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, as well as several food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, including Clostridium tyrobutyricum. It displays a bactericidal effect towards the most sensitive indicator strain, Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei LMG 13558(T), while the producer strain itself displays autoinhibition when it is grown under conditions that do not favor bacteriocin production. Macedocin is active at pHs between 4.0 and 9.0, and it retains activity even after incubation for 20 min at 121 degrees C with 1 atm of overpressure. Inhibition of macedocin by proteolytic enzymes is variable.
TI  - A novel area of predictive modelling: describing the functionality of beneficial  microorganisms in foods.
AB  - Predictive microbiology generally focuses on the potential outgrowth of spoilage  bacteria and foodborne pathogens in foods. Little attention has been paid to the biokinetics of beneficial foodgrade microorganisms, such as lactic acid bacteria. The latter is commonly used in the food fermentation industry, mainly for the in situ production of the antimicrobial lactic acid to extend the shelf life of the food. Furthermore, many strains show additional industrial potential as novel starter cultures since they produce functional metabolites, such as bacteriocins and exopolysaccharides. The production of these functional metabolites has been demonstrated during in vitro experiments, but in many cases these novel starter cultures seem to be less efficient when applied in a food system. A modelling approach may contribute to a better understanding of the tight relation between the food environment and bacterial functionality. Primary modelling can be applied to fit the experimental data concerning cell growth, sugar metabolism, and the production of functional metabolites for a given set of environmental conditions. This led to conclusions concerning the growth-associated production of bacteriocin and exopolysaccharides, the inactivation of these molecules when cell growth levels off, and a minimum cell concentration to trigger on bacteriocin production. Examples deal with the production of the bacteriocin sakacin K by the natural fermented sausage isolate Lactobacillus sakei CTC 494, and the production of heteropolysaccharides by the yoghurt starter culture Streptococcus thermophilus LY03. Secondary modelling of biokinetic parameters quantifies the production of bacteriocin and exopolysaccharides in function of environmental factors. As an example, the specific bacteriocin production by Lb. sakei CTC 494 decreases with increasing sodium chloride concentrations. Furthermore, since the assessment of functionality is frequently hampered by the nature of the food system, mathematical modelling techniques may help to predict the functional behaviour of novel lactic acid bacteria starter cultures in a food matrix, and hence quantify in situ production. For example, a model may simulate cell growth and exopolysaccharide production of S. thermophilus LY03 in a milk environment, where direct measurements are difficult to perform.
TI  - Biodegradability of food-associated extracellular polysaccharides.
AB  - Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) produced by lactic acid bacteria, which are common in fermented foods, are claimed to have various beneficial physiological effects on humans. Although the biodegradability of EPSs is important in relation to the bioactive properties, knowledge on this topic is limited. Therefore, the biodegradability of eight EPSs, six of which were produced by lactic acid bacteria, was compared with microorganisms from human feces or soil. EPS-degradation was determined from the decrease in polysaccharide-sugar concentration and by high-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Xanthan, clavan, and the EPSs produced by Streptococcus thermophilus SFi 39 and SFi 12 were readily degraded, in contrast to the EPSs produced by Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris B40, Lactobacillus sakei 0-1, S. thermophilus SFi20, and Lactobacillus helveticus Lh59. Clearly, the susceptibility of exopolysaccharides to biological breakdown can differ greatly, implying that the physiological effects of these compounds may also vary a lot.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of gram-positive bacteria based on grpE, encoded by the dnaK operon.
AB  - The dnaK operon in gram-positive bacteria includes grpE, dnaJ and, in some members, hrcA as well. Both DnaK and DnaJ have been utilized for constructing phylogenetic relationships among various organisms. Multiple copies exist for dnaK and dnaJ genes in some bacterial genera, as opposed to a single gene copy for grpE and for hrcA, according to the currently available data. Here, we present a partial protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria, derived by using the amino acid sequence identity of GrpE; the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 5S rRNA, 16S rRNA, dnaK and dnaJ sequences. Our results indicate three main groupings: two are within low-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria comprising Bacillus species and Staphylococcus aureus on the one hand and Streptococcus species/Lactococcus lactis/Enterococcus faecalis/Lactobacillus sakei on the other hand; the Mycobacterium species and Streptomyces coelicolor, belonging to the high-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria, form the third cluster. This hierarchical arrangement is in close agreement with that obtained with 16S rRNA and DnaK sequences but not DnaJ-based phylogeny.
TI  - ClpE, a novel type of HSP100 ATPase, is part of the CtsR heat shock regulon of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - Clp ATPases, which include the ubiquitous HSP100 family, are classified according to their structural features and sequence similarities. During the course of the Bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we identified a gene encoding a new member of the HSP100 family. We designated this protein ClpE, as it is the prototype of a novel subfamily among the Clp ATPases, and have identified homologues in several bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus sakei and Clostridium acetobutylicum. A unique feature of these Hsp100-type Clp ATPases is their amino-terminal zinc finger motif. Unlike the other class III genes of B. subtilis (clpC and clpP ), clpE does not appear to be required for stress tolerance. Transcriptional analysis revealed two sigmaA-type promoters, expression from which was shown to be inducible by heat shock and puromycin treatment. Investigation of the regulatory mechanism controlling clpE expression indicates that this gene is controlled by CtsR and is thus a member of the class III heat shock genes of B. subtilis. CtsR negatively regulates clpE expression by binding to the promoter region, in which five CtsR binding sites were identified through DNase I footprinting and sequence analysis.
