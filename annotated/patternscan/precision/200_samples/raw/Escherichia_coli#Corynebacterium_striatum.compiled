TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Chemokine CXCL10 for Dermal and Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - CXCL10 (IP-10) is a small 10 kDa chemokine with antimicrobial activity. It is induced by IFN-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of T cells. Recently, we detected CXCL10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. In the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that CXCL10 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium striatum, and Candida albicans HMV4C, but not Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Poryphromonas gingivalis, or C. albicans ATCC 64124. The reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. However, antimicrobial activity of CXCL10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues, 7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pI of 9.93. Modeling studies revealed that CXCL10 contains an alpha-helix at the N-terminal, three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the C-terminal. Thus, CXCL10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.
TI  - [Etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia at the Cardiovascular Surgery Clinic of Iasi].
AB  - AIM: We want to assess the etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and  emergence of resistant phenotypes for greater efficiency of the first-line antimicrobial treatment post-cardiac surgery. The study focuses on patients with VAP post-cardiac surgery at the Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery between April 2nd 2002 and August 27th 2008, divided in two groups, before and after June 14th, 2005. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The tracheal aspirates were examined quantitatively (microscopy, culture). The isolates with clinical significance (> or = 106 CFU/mL) were identified by standard methods and tested by disk difussion or with the breakpoints method for susceptibility to antibiotics. RESULTS: Among the 1527 operated patients, 28 of them were diagnosed with VAP through the clinical pulmonary infection score > or = 6. The 9 most common pathogens in VAP etiology were Pseudomonas aeruginosa 23.81%, Acinetobacter baumannii 19.05%, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 11.91%, Candida albicans 9.53%, while Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium striatum/amycolatum, Pneumocystis jirovecii amounted 4.76% each. Acinetobacter baumannii and S.maltophilia appear starting with June 15th, 2005. From that moment on we isolated with a higher frequency the gram-negative bacilli which produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases 15.62%, with multidrug resistance (MDR) 46.86%. The MDR phenotype was more frequent at A.baumannii (15.62%), S. maltophilia (15.62%) and P. aeruginosa (12.50%) compared to K .pneumoniae (3.12%) or E. coli (0%). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was isolated with a 6.25% frequency. CONCLUSIONS: The most common etiologic agents of ventilator-associated pneumonia post-cardiac surgery are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Candida albicans. The large use of antibiotics selects infectious agents with intrinsic resistance and multiresistant
TI  - Antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - There is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. How lipids interact with bacteria to achieve a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. To begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases D-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four Gram-negative bacteria and seven Gram-positive bacteria. Exact Kruskal-Wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (P < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. D-sphingosine (MBC range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (MBC range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (MBC range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Sapienic acid (MBC range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, Corynebacterium bovis, Corynebacterium striatum, and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Lauric acid (MBC range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except E. coli, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa (MBC > 500 mug/ml). Complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. Hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.
TI  - Isolation of a bacterial enzyme releasing axillary malodor and its use as a screening target for novel deodorant formulations.
AB  - Axillary odor is known since 50 years to be formed upon the action of Corynebacteria on odorless axilla secretions, but the nature of the bacterial enzymes involved in this process remained a mystery. We identified the known axilla odor determinant 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid in hydrolyzed axilla secretions along with a new, chemically related compound, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-hexanoic acid. The natural, odorless precursors of both these acids were purified from non-hydrolyzed fresh axilla secretions. The malodorous acids were shown to be covalently linked to a glutamine residue in fresh axilla secretions. Corynebacteria, but not Staphylococci, isolated from the axilla were found to release the acids from these precursors in vitro. A Zn(2+) -dependent aminoacylase mediating this cleavage was then purified from Corynebacterium striatum Ax20 and the corresponding gene agaA was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Based on these biochemical findings, novel approaches in research on axilla malodor control are presented: (a) With a new test method using the isolated Corynebacteria and their enzymatic activity, the direct malodor-controlling activity of existing cosmetic ingredients was evaluated. (b) The structure of the natural malodor precursor was modified by replacing the malodor acid with fragrance molecules. These new fragrance precursors were shown to be cleaved by the same aminoacylase.
TI  - Impact of manufacturing, irradiation and filtration steps to bacterial contamination of autologous fibrin sealant.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preoperative production of autologous fibrin sealant has become a routine procedure during the last years. As a certain percentage of blood products is contaminated with bacteria, contamination of plasma used for the production of fibrin sealant cannot be excluded. Especially in the orthopaedic setting, application of contaminated fibrin sealant can cause severe infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We contaminated plasma with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium striatum, Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli and produced fibrin sealant by cryoprecipitation and alcohol precipitation. Additionally, the products were gamma-irradiated at a dose of 30 Gy, frozen at -55 degrees C and filtered through a 0.2 microm filter after thawing. After each preparation step, samples were drawn and numbers of colony forming units were counted after incubation on agar plates. RESULTS: Cryoprecipitation, irradiation, freezing at -55 degrees C, and alcohol precipitation have only little impact on numbers of colony forming units. Filtration through a bacterial filter results in a sterile product. CONCLUSION: Bacteria in plasma as a starting material for production of fibrin sealant survive all routine steps of production, including gamma irradiation and freezing. Filtration of the product through a qualified bacterial filter is the only safe means to provide a sterile product.
TI  - A specific bacterial aminoacylase cleaves odorant precursors secreted in the human axilla.
AB  - Human axillary odor is known to be formed upon the action of Corynebacteria sp. on odorless axilla secretions. The known axilla odor determinant 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid was identified in hydrolyzed axilla secretions along with a chemically related compound, 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid. The natural precursors of both these acids were purified from non-hydrolyzed axilla secretions. From liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, it appeared that the acids are covalently linked to a glutamine residue in fresh axilla secretions, and the corresponding conjugates were synthesized for confirmation. Bacterial isolates obtained from the human axilla and belonging to the Corynebacteria were found to release the acids from these odorless precursors in vitro. A Zn(2+)-dependent aminoacylase mediating this cleavage was purified from Corynebacterium striatum Ax20, and the corresponding gene agaA was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme is highly specific for the glutamine residue but has a low specificity for the acyl part of the substrate. agaA is closely related to many genes coding for enzymes involved in the cleavage of N-terminal acyl and aryl substituents from amino acids. This is the first report of the structure elucidation of precursors for human body odorants and the isolation of the bacterial enzyme involved in their cleavage.
TI  - Corynebacterium striatum chloramphenicol resistance transposon Tn5564: genetic organization and transposition in Corynebacterium glutamicum.
AB  - The clinical isolate Corynebacterium striatum M82B (formerly Corynebacterium xerosis M82B) carries the 50-kb R-plasmid pTP10 conferring resistance to the antibiotics chloramphenicol, erythromycin, kanamycin, and tetracycline. DNA sequence analysis of the chloramphenicol resistance region revealed the presence of the 4155-bp transposable element Tn5564. The ends of Tn5564 are identical 22-bp inverted repeats flanked by a 6-bp target site duplication. The central region of Tn5564 encodes the chloramphenicol resistance gene cmx, specifying a transmembrane chloramphenicol efflux protein, and an open reading frame homologous to transposases of insertion sequences identified in Arthrobacter nicotinovorans and Bordetella pertussis. Furthermore, the 1715-bp insertion sequence IS1513 encoding a putative transposase of the IS30 family is an integral part of Tn5564 and is located upstream of cmx. For transposon mutagenesis, Tn5564 was transferred to Corynebacterium glutamicum on a mobilizable Escherichia coli plasmid using RP4-mediated intergeneric conjugation. Transposition of Tn5564 in C. glutamicum occurred with a frequency of 3.3 x 10(-8) and resulted in an insertion into target sites containing the central palindromic tetranucleotide CTAG. A Tn5564-induced mutant strain of C. glutamicum was found to carry the transposon in the ftsZ gene region.
