TI  == potentially probiotic and bioprotective lactic acid bacteria starter cultures antagonise the listeria monocytogenes adhesion to ht29 colonocyte-like cells.
AB  == the capability of five lactic acid bacteria (lab) to counteract the adhesion of listeria monocytogenes to the epithelial intestinal cell line ht29 was studied. the highest adhesion ability to ht29 was achieved by the intestinal strain lactobacillus rhamnosus ctc1679, followed by the meat-derived strains lactobacillus sakei ctc494 and enterococcus faecium ctc8005. surprisingly, the meat strains showed significantly better adhesion to ht29 than two faecal isolates of lactobacillus casei and even significantly higher than the reference  strain l. rhamnosus gg. additionally, the anti-listerial, bacteriocin-producer starter culture l. sakei ctc494 was able to significantly reduce the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes to ht29 in experiments of exclusion, competition and inhibition. the performance was better than the faecal isolate l. rhamnosus ctc1679. our results reinforce the fact that the ability of lab to interact with a host epithelium model, as well as to antagonise with foodborne pathogens, is a strain-specific characteristic. additionally, it is underlined that this trait is not dependent on the origin of the bacterium, since some food lab behave better than intestinal ones. therefore, the search for novel strains in food niches is a suitable approach to find those with potential health benefits. these strains are likely pre-adapted to the food environment, which would make their inclusion in the formulation of probiotic foods more feasible.

TI  == decolonization of gastrointestinal carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  faecium: case series and review of literature.
AB  == background: prolonged asymptomatic carriage of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in the gastrointestinal tract and the lack of effective decolonization regimen perpetuate the endemicity of vre in the healthcare settings. case presentation: we report a regimen for decolonization of gastrointestinal carriage of vre by a combination of environmental disinfection, patient isolation, bowel preparation to wash-out the fecal bacterial population using polyethylene glycol, a five-day course of oral absorbable linezolid and non-absorbable daptomycin to suppress any remaining vre, and subsequent oral lactobacillus rhamnosus gg to maintain the colonization resistance in four patients, including two patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis, one patient with complication post liver transplant, and one patient with complicated infective endocarditis. all patients had clearance of vre immediately after decolonization, and 3 of them remained vre-free for 23 to 137 days of hospitalization, despite subsequent use of intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics without anti-vre activity. conclusion: this strategy should be further studied in settings of low vre endemicity with limited isolation facilities.

TI  == distribution of antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria in natural cheese in japan.
AB  == to determine and compare the extent of contamination caused by antimicrobial-resistant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in imported and domestic natural cheeses on the japanese market, lab were isolated using deman, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar and mrs agar supplemented with six antimicrobials. from 38 imported and 24 japanese cheeses, 409 lab isolates were obtained and their antimicrobial resistance was tested. the percentage of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin, erythromycin, and/or oxytetracycline isolated from imported  cheeses (42.1%) was significantly higher than that of lab resistant to dihydrostreptomycin or oxytetracycline from cheeses produced in japan (16.7%; p=0.04). antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in enterococcus faecalis (tetl, tetm, and ermb; tetl and ermb; tetm) e. faecium (tetm), lactococcus lactis (tets), lactobacillus (lb.), casei/paracasei (tetm or tetw), and lb. rhamnosus (ermb) isolated from seven imported cheeses. moreover, these e. faecalis isolates were able to transfer antimicrobial resistance gene(s). although antimicrobial resistance genes were not detected in any lab isolates from japanese cheeses, lb. casei/paracasei and lb. coryniformis isolates from a japanese farm-made cheese were resistant to oxytetracycline (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic], 32 microg/ml). leuconostoc isolates from three japanese farm-made cheeses were also  resistant to dihydrostreptomycin (mic, 32 to >512 microg/ml). in conclusion, the  present study demonstrated contamination with antimicrobial-resistant lab in imported and japanese farm-made cheeses on the japanese market, but not in japanese commercial cheeses.

TI  == influence of autochthonous adjunct cultures on ripening parameters of argentinean goat's milk cheeses.
AB  == background: argentinean semi-hard goat's cheeses manufactured with and without the addition of autochthonous adjunct cultures of lactobacillus plantarum etc17,  lactobacillus rhamnosus etc14 and enterococcus faecium etc3 were analysed to evaluate the effect of these strains on ripening parameters. results: gross composition was similar among cheeses. microbiological analysis indicated that lactic acid bacteria added to cheeses reached high levels. none of the strains assayed affected the primary proteolysis. overall, e. faecium had a clearer effect on the peptide and lipolysis profiles of cheeses. analysis of the volatile fraction of cheeses indicated that the levels of several compounds involved in the overall flavour of goat's cheeses were affected by the presence of e. faecium. this could explain the differences detected in the global perception of  cheeses made with this strain compared with control cheeses. conclusion: the present work represents a first contribution to knowledge of the ripening process of argentinean goat's cheeses made with the addition of autochthonous adjunct cultures. the results suggest that e. faecium etc3 showed a significant effect during ripening, which was reflected both in the profiles of proteolysis, lipolysis and volatile compounds and in the global sensory perception of cheeses.

TI  == effects of dietary supplementation of citrus by-products fermented with a probiotic microbe on growth performance, innate immunity and disease resistance against edwardsiella tarda in juvenile olive flounder, paralichthys olivaceus (temminck & schlegel).
AB  == two consecutive studies were conducted to evaluate the dietary supplementation of citrus by-products (cb) fermented with probiotic bacteria on growth performance,  feed utilization, innate immune responses and disease resistance of juvenile olive flounder. in experiment i, five diets were formulated to contain 0% (control) or 3% four different cb fermented with bacillus subtilis (bs), enterococcus faecium (ef), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr) and l. plantarum (lp) (designated as con, cbf-bs, cbf-ef, cbf-lr and cbf-lp, respectively). during 10 weeks of a feeding trial, growth performance and feed efficiency were not significantly different among all the fish groups. however, fish fed cbf containing diets had significantly higher survivals than the con group. disease resistance of fish against edwardsiella tarda was increased by the fermentation of cb. in experiment ii, we chose the bs as a promising probiotic and formulated  five diets to contain 0%, 2%, 4%, 6% and 8% cbf-bs. growth performance was not significantly affected by the cbf-bs supplementation during 6 weeks of a feeding  trial. innate immunity of fish was significantly enhanced by cbf-bs supplementation. myeloperoxidase and lysozyme activities were increased in a dose-dependent manner by dietary cbf-bs inclusions. in a consecutive challenge test against e. tarda, an increased disease resistance was found by cbf-bs supplementation. these studies indicate that the fermentation process of cb with  probiotic has beneficial effects on innate immunity and thereby increases disease resistance of olive flounder against e. tarda. bacillus subtilis can be used as a promising probiotic microbe for by-product fermentation in fish feeds.

TI  == immunomodulatory properties of enterococcus faecium jws 833 isolated from duck intestinal tract and suppression of listeria monocytogenes infection.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory properties of enterococcus faecium jws 833 (jws 833) isolated from duck intestine and compare them to those of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), a proven immunity-enhancing probiotic. to investigate the immune-enhancing properties of jws 833, production  of nitric oxide (no) and cytokines was measured in mouse peritoneal macrophages.  in addition, a listeria monocytogenes challenge model was used in the assessment. it was found that heat-killed jws 833 stimulates mouse peritoneal macrophages to  produce no, interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and that oral administration of viable jws833 enhances no, il-1beta and tnf-alpha synthesis upon l. monocytogenes challenge. moreover, mice fed with  jws 833 were partially protected against lethal challenge with l. monocytogenes.  jws 833 strain has significantly greater immunostimulatory properties than lgg. moreover, jws 833 strain partially protects mice against lethal challenge with l. monocytogenes. jws 833, a novel strain of e. faecium isolated from duck intestine, is potentially a useful feed supplement for controlling pathogens and  enhancing host immune responses.

TI  == isolation and partial characterization of halotolerant lactic acid bacteria from  two mexican cheeses.
AB  == isolated strains of halotolerant or halophilic lactic acid bacteria (halab) from  cotija and doble crema cheeses were identified and partially characterized by phenotypic and genotypic methods, and their technological abilities were studied  in order to test their potential use as dairy starter components. humidity, a(w), ph, and salt concentration of cheeses were determined. genotypic diversity was evaluated by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction. molecular identification and phylogenetic reconstructions based on 16s rrna gene  sequences were performed. additional technological abilities such as salt tolerance, acidifying, and proteolytic and lipolytic activities were also investigated. the differences among strains reflected the biodiversity of halab in both types of cheeses. lactobacillus acidipiscis, tetragenococcus halophilus,  weissella thailandensis, and lactobacillus pentosus from cotija cheese, and l. acidipiscis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus farciminis, and lactobacillus rhamnosus from doble crema cheese were identified based on 16s rrna. quantitative and qualitative assessments showed strains of t.  halophilus and l. plantarum to be proteolytic, along with e. faecium, l. farciminis, and l. pentosus to a lesser extent. lipolytic activity could be demonstrated in strains of e. faecium, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, and t. halophilus. strains belonging to the species l. pentosus, l. plantarum, and e. faecium were able to acidify the milk media. this study evidences the presence of halab that may play a role in the ripening of cheeses.

TI  == potential beneficial properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from smoked salmon.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the probiotic properties of strains isolated from smoked salmon and previously identified as bacteriocin producers. methods and results: strains  lactobacillus curvatus et06, et30 and et31, lactobacillus fermentum et35, lactobacillus delbrueckii et32, pediococcus acidilactici et34 and enterococcus faecium et05, et12 and et88 survived conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract (git) and produced bacteriocins active against several strains of listeria  monocytogenes, but presented very low activity against other lactic acid bacteria (lab). cell-free supernatants containing bacteriocins, added to 3-h-old cultures  of l. monocytogenes 603, suppressed growth over 12 h. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values ranged from 7.2% for et35 to 12.1% for et05. various  degrees of co-aggregation with l. monocytogenes 603, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 were observed. adherence of the bacteriocinogenic strains to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. the highest levels of hydrophobicity were recorded for lact. curvatus (61.9-64.6%), lact. fermentum (78.9%), lact. delbrueckii (43.7%) and ped. acidilactici (51.3%), which are higher than the one recorded for lact. rhamnosus gg (53.3%). these strains were highly sensitive to several antibiotics and affected by several drugs from different generic groups in a strain-dependent manner. conclusions: smoked salmon is a rich source of probiotic lab. all strains survived conditions simulating the git and produced bacteriocins active against various pathogens. adherence to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lact. rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. in addition, the high hydrophobicity readings recorded define the strains as good probiotics.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria efficiently protect human and animal intestinal epithelial and immune cells from enteric virus infection.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) using animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell line models  of non tumor origin. to this end, lab strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (rv) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev). in order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ros) release as well as the attachment ability of lab on the cell lines was investigated. various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral rv or tgev disruption. highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus casei shirota against both rv and tgev, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to enterococcus faecium pck38, lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc179, lactobacillus pentosus pca227 and lactobacillus plantarum pca236 and pcs22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. a variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of no(-) and h(2)o(2) (ros) was obtained when lab strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be lab strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ros release in more than one cell line. in contrast, the ability of the examined lab strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was lab strain but not cell line specific. highest attachment ability was observed with l. plantarum aca-dc 146, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans aca-dc 4037 and e. faecium pcd71. clear  indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the l. casei shirota against tgev and with l. plantarum pca236 against both rv and tgev. in the rest of the cases, each interaction was lab-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. however, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacterial strains of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus on enteroaggregative escherichia coli.
AB  == the effects of nine probiotic strains of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus on the growth, adhesion activity, and biofilm formation of enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) were examined. the culture supernatant of the e. faecium strain, with or without ph adjustment to a neutral  ph, had a strong bactericidal effect on eaggec, including induction of membrane damage and cell lysis. supernatants of the l. casei ss. casei and l. casei ss. rhamnosus strains also had a bactericidal effect on eaggec, but this activity was abolished by ph adjustment to a neutral ph. no inhibitory effect of the culture supernatants of bifidobacterium or e. faecalis strains was detected. adhesion of  eaggec to intestinal epithelial cells was not inhibited by the bacterial strains  tested. two strains of l. casei enhanced eaggec biofilm formation, which was characterized by increased bacterial proliferation. these results suggest that the three different bacterial species; lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus, have different effects on eaggec, and that further analysis is required for the practical use of these bacteria as probiotics against eaggec infection.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5),  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis  (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c  for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents  and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china.
AB  == a total of 567 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from the stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china. in order to reduce the number of strains for further examinations, 36 isolates were screened out for further examination whilst the other strains, which had lower probiotic properties, were not suitable for yogurt production due to the absence of growth in ph 3.5 mrs medium and no curding during fermentation, and so were excluded. the result of identification by api, sequence analysis of 16s rrna and random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis showed that there were three strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, 10 strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, three strains of lactobacillus casein, three strains of lactobacillus  brevis, two strains of enterococcus faecium, two strains of enterococcus faecalis, four strains of bifdibacterium infantis, three strains of bifdibacterium brevise, three strains of bifdibacterium bifidium, two strains of  bifdibacterium adolecentis and one strain of bifdibacterium longam among the 36 isolates. these strains were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to ph 2.0, 3.0 and/or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. the results presented here show that l. rhamnosus lv108, l.  rhamnosus f, b. brevise r39 and b. infantis r42 are acid and bile tolerant, adhere to the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cell line, antagonistic activity against potential pathogenic bacteria infection in vitro, and so are potential strains for probiotic use.

TI  == probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  == according to the german definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of l. casei or the l. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, certain enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) and the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact  with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are  basic mechanisms. they are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. in addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. well-established probiotic effects are: 1. prevention  and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. prevention or alleviation of allergies and  atopic diseases in infants. 7. prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). a prebiotic is  "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for  prebiotic classification. they are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. other health effects of prebiotics  (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect,  i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. in the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.

TI  == characterization of dominant lactic acid bacteria isolated from sao jorge cheese, using biochemical and ribotyping methods.
AB  == aims: to identify, using phenotypic and genotypic methods, the dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) present in sao jorge cheese - one of the 11 portuguese cheeses currently bearing an appellation d'origine protegee status. methods and results: a total of 225 isolates from milk, curd and cheeses throughout ripening  were identified to the genus level, 108 to the species level and ten to the strain level. phenotypic methods indicated that lactobacilli, followed by enterococci, were the dominant bacteria. the most frequently isolated species were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, enterococcus faecalis and  enterococcus faecium. ribotyping differentiated three l. paracasei, two e. faecalis and one lactobacillus plantarum types. enterococcus spp. exhibited the highest esterase and beta-galactosidase activities among all isolates. conclusions: the dominant lab in sao jorge cheese are l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, e. faecalis and e. faecium. enterococcus likely plays a leading role upon acidification and aroma development in said cheese. significance and impact of the study: our results support that a combination of conventional biochemical methods with genotypic methods allows for a thorough characterization and identification of isolates. despite the limited number of isolates subject to molecular subtyping, a few specific enterococcus and lactobacillus strains were found that are promising ones for development of a starter culture. hence, l. paracasei and e. faecalis are good candidates for a tentative starter culture, designed for manufacturing of sao jorge cheese at large - which takes advantage of actual isolates, in attempts to eventually standardize the quality of said cheese variety.

TI  == are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  == goals: assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. background: probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on  the host. as a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. study: the feces of seven volunteers  were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: e. coli nissle 0.5-5 x  10(9) cells (mutaflor), enterococcus faecium sf 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (bioflorin), lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (infloran), lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (omniflora), lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with lactobacillus casei immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (actimel). ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and dna was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd). typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. results: fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking bioflorin, and from 1/6 after infloran. cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of antibiophilus, omniflora and actimel. conclusions: after oral consumption of probiotics, e. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). in contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, certain strains of l. casei, l. acidophilus, escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and  enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) as well as the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. however, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.

TI  == immune modulation and expression of cytokine genes in rainbow trout oncorhynchus  mykiss upon probiotic feeding.
AB  == this study elucidates the immune modulation including the expression of cytokine  genes following dietary administration of three selected probiotic bacteria--lactobacillus rhamnosus, enterococcus faecium and bacillus subtilis to  fish, rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss. they were fed for 45 days on either a basal control diet or one of the three probiotic diets containing the specific bacteria in freeze-dried form at a density of 10(9)cfugfeed-1. the non-specific immune parameters examined--superoxide anion production by the head kidney leukocytes and the alternate complement activity of serum was improved by probiotic feeding. besides this, the relative gene expressions of interleukin-1beta1, tumor necrosis factor 1 and 2 and transforming growth factor-beta were up regulated in the spleen and the head kidney. the comparatively better performance of e. faecium could possibly be linked to their  suitable ambient temperature conditions. thus, probiotic bacteria delivered in feed exerts its influence on the immune system of fish, both at cellular and molecular levels.

TI  == adhesion of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == the intestinal mucus layer provides a potential niche for colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref). we therefore examined the ability of six vref strains to adhere to human intestinal mucus and determined binding kinetics. four of six (67%) vref strains demonstrated significant adhesion to immobilized intestinal mucus compared with a salmonella typhimurium-negative control strain, but the level of adherence was low compared  with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. binding kinetics studies demonstrated that the maximum number of these four vref strains that could adhere to a unit surface area of immobilized mucus was similar to or higher than the maximum number of l.  rhamnosus gg that could adhere; however, l. rhamnosus gg demonstrated 20- to 130-times higher affinity than the vref strains. these results demonstrate that vref strains may adhere to human intestinal mucus and suggest that l. rhamnosus gg might be able to displace vref strains.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in moroccan soft white cheese (jben).
AB  == the bacterial diversity occurring in traditional moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in morocco, was studied. a total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. the majority of the strains belonged to the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc and enterococcus.  sixteen species were identified: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus buchneri, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus raffinolactis, leuconostoc  pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc citreum, eterococcus  durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus saccharominimus and streptococcus sp.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made  up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (bhi-blood agar), adjusted to ph 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic glove box. bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched bhi broth  adjusted to ph 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and  16s rdna sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. in the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard bhi-blood agars (ph 7.0) were used. of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at ph 9.0 and 4 at ph 10.0. the alkali-resistant strains included enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and streptococcus mitis (2 strains). three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus firmicutes or staphylococcus at the genus level. the present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at ph 9.0 and/or ph 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus enterococcus.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == construction and use of a computerized dna fingerprint database for lactic acid bacteria from silage.
AB  == efficient selection of new silage inoculant strains from a collection of over 10,000 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (lab) requires excellent strain discrimination. toward that end, we constructed a gelcompar ii database of dna fingerprint patterns of ethidium bromide-stained ecori fragments of total lab dna separated by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. we found that the total dna patterns were strain-specific; 56/60 american type culture collection strains of 33 species of lab could be distinguished. enterococcus faecium strains atcc19434 and atcc35667 had identical total dna patterns and riboprints. lactobacillus rhamnosus strains atcc7469 and atcc27773 also had identical total dna patterns, but different riboprints. ecori riboprint patterns could distinguish only about 9/23 lactobacillus plantarum strains and about 6/10 lactobacillus buchneri strains, whereas all 33 strains could be distinguished by  ecori total dna patterns. despite gel-to-gel variation, new dna patterns can be readily grouped with existing patterns using gelcompar ii. the database contains  large homogenous clusters of l. plantarum, e. faecium, l. buchneri, lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus species that can be used for tentative taxonomic assignment. we routinely use the dna fingerprint database to identify and characterize new strains, eliminate duplicate isolates and for quality control of inoculant product strains. the gelcompar ii database has been in continuous use for 7 years and contains more than 3600 patterns representing approximately 700 unique patterns from over 300 gels and is the largest computerized dna fingerprint database for lab yet reported.

TI  == probiotics, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile diarrhoea in humans.
AB  == probiotics are living organisms which, when ingested, have a beneficial therapeutic effect. examples are bacteria, especially lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. controlled trials indicate a benefit of both of these in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. other less effective probiotics are lactinex, enterococcus faecium and bifidobacteria. in the difficult clinical problem of recurrent clostridium difficile disease, s. boulardii as an adjunct to antibiotics has shown benefit in controlled trials. there is, however, less convincing evidence for the efficacy of lactobacillus gg  in this disease. additional controlled trials and safety studies are needed before there can be a widespread endorsement of probiotics for these two conditions.

TI  == binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ecm) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. methods and results: ecm molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota and l. johnsonii la1) as well as by l. casei l.c., lactobacillus sp. 2i3 and by l. plantarum lp. the other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. significance and impact of the study: some  animal strains (at least l. casei l.c. and lactobacillus sp. 2i3) are comparable  with the commercially used strains with respect to their ecm binding ability. as  this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.

TI  == interaction between probiotic lactic acid bacteria and canine enteric pathogens:  a risk factor for intestinal enterococcus faecium colonization?
AB  == selected probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been shown to elicit positive  health effects particularly in humans. competitive exclusion of pathogens is one  of the most important beneficial health claims of probiotic bacteria. the effect  of probiotic lab on competitive exclusion of pathogens has been demonstrated in humans, chicken and pigs. in this study we evaluated the ability of certain lab strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium lactis bb12, lactobacillus pentosus uk1a, l. pentosus sk2a, enterococcus faecium m74 and e. faecium sf273) to inhibit the adhesion of selected canine and zoonotic pathogens (staphylococcus intermedius, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, clostridium perfringens and campylobacter jejuni) to immobilised mucus isolated from canine jejunal chyme in  vitro. adhesion of c. perfringens was reduced significantly by all tested lab strains, between 53.7 and 79.1% of the control without lab, the lab of canine origin yielding the best reduction. the adhesion of s. typhimurium and s. intermedius were not significantly altered by any of the lab included in the study. both enterococci tested significantly enhanced the adhesion of c. jejuni,  to 134.6 and 205.5% of the control without lab. e. faecium may thus favor the adhesion and colonization of c. jejuni in the dog's intestine, making it a potential carrier and possibly a source for human infection. enhanced c. jejuni adhesion is a new potential risk factor of enterococci. our results further emphasize the importance of safety guidelines to be established for the probiotics intended for animal use.

TI  == probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. in some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. other studies focusing on lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. among these, a positive effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum and enterococcus faecium sf68 has been reported. effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.

TI  == probiotics: "living drugs".
AB  == the uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve  the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. the yeast saccharomyces boulardii and the  bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain gg, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. other probiotics  that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus  faecium. the use of s. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of clostridium difficile-associated disease. other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. several lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of  the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin a, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. the available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is  severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. effective use of probiotics could decrease  patients' exposure to antimicrobials. additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.

TI  == characterization of the properties of human- and dairy-derived probiotics for prevention of infectious diseases in fish.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the potential probiotic properties of six  lactic acid bacteria (lab) intended for human use, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. rhamnosus lc 705, bifidobacterium lactis bb12, and lactobacillus johnsonii la1, and one for animal use, enterococcus faecium tehobak, for use as a fish probiotic. the strains for human use were specifically chosen since they are known to be safe for human use, which is of major importance because the fish are meant for human  consumption. the selection was carried out by five different methods: mucosal adhesion, mucosal penetration, inhibition of pathogen growth and adhesion, and resistance to fish bile. the adhesion abilities of the seven lab and three fish pathogens, vibrio anguillarum, aeromonas salmonicida, and flavobacterium psychrophilum, were determined to mucus from five different sites on the surface  or in the gut of rainbow trout. five of the tested lab strains showed considerable adhesion to different fish mucus types (14 to 26% of the added bacteria). despite their adhesive character, the lab strains were not able to inhibit the mucus binding of a. salmonicida. coculture experiments showed significant inhibition of growth of a. salmonicida, which was mediated by competition for nutrients rather than secretion of inhibitory substances by the probiotic bacteria as measured in spent culture liquid. all lab except l. casei shirota showed tolerance against fish bile. l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 and l. bulgaricus were found to penetrate fish mucus better than other probiotic bacteria. based on bile resistance, mucus adhesion, mucus penetration, and suppression of fish pathogen growth, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 and l. bulgaricus can be considered for future in vivo challenge studies in fish as a novel and safe treatment in aquaculture.

TI  == protection from gastrointestinal diseases with the use of probiotics.
AB  == probiotics are nonpathogenic microorganisms that, when ingested, exert a positive influence on the health or physiology of the host. they can influence intestinal  physiology either directly or indirectly through modulation of the endogenous ecosystem or immune system. the results that have been shown with a sufficient level of proof to enable probiotics to be used as treatments for gastrointestinal disturbances are 1) the good tolerance of yogurt compared with milk in subjects with primary or secondary lactose maldigestion, 2) the use of saccharomyces boulardii and enterococcus faecium sf 68 to prevent or shorten the duration of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, 3) the use of s. boulardii to prevent further recurrence of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, and 4) the use of fermented milks containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg to shorten the duration of  diarrhea in infants with rotavirus enteritis (and probably also in gastroenteritis of other causes). effects that are otherwise suggested for diverse probiotics include alleviation of diarrhea of miscellaneous causes; prophylaxis of gastrointestinal infections, which includes traveler's diarrhea; and immunomodulation. trials of gastrointestinal diseases that involve the ecosystem are currently being performed, eg, helicobacter pylori infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.
