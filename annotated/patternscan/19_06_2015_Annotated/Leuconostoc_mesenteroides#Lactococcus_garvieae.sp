TI  == application of universal stress proteins in probing the dynamics of potent degraders in complex terephthalate metagenome.
AB  == the culture-independent strategies to study microbial diversity and function have led to a revolution in environmental genomics, enabling fundamental questions about the distribution of microbes and their influence on bioremediation to be addressed. in this research we used the expression of universal stress proteins as a probe to determine the changes in degrading microbial population from a highly toxic terephthalate wastewater to a less toxic activated sludge bioreactor. the impact of relative toxicities was significantly elaborated at the levels of genus and species. the results indicated that 23 similar prokaryotic phyla were represented in both metagenomes irrespective of their relative abundance. furthermore, the following bacteria taxa micromonosporaceae, streptomyces, cyanothece sp. pcc 7822, alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius, bacillus  halodurans, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactococcus garvieae, brucellaceae, ralstonia solanacearum, verminephrobacter eiseniae, azoarcus, acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, francisella tularensis, methanothermus fervidus, and methanocorpusculum labreanum were represented only in the activated sludge bioreactor. these highly dynamic microbes could serve as taxonomic biomarkers for toxic thresholds related to terephthalate and its derivatives. this paper, highlights the application of universal stress proteins in metagenomics analysis. dynamics of microbial consortium of this nature can have future in biotechnological applications in bioremediation of toxic chemicals and radionuclides.

TI  == oxalate-degrading capacities of lactic acid bacteria in canine feces.
AB  == in this study, lactic acid bacteria in canine feces were isolated and identified, and their oxalate-degrading capacities were evaluated. the oxalate-degrading capacities were determined for 24 of 47 (51.06%) lactic acid bacteria isolates. of these, 8 isolates [leuconostoc mesenteroides (rl75), lactococcus garvieae (cd2), lactococcus subsp. lactis (cs21), enterococcus faecium (cl71 and cl72), and enterococcus faecalis (cd14, cs62, and cd12)] degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present, while the others degraded less than 5% of the oxalate in vitro.  isolates that degraded more than 5% of the oxalate present were selected for further examination. the oxalate-degrading capacities of individual isolates, a mixture of enterococcus, a mixture of lactococcus, and a mixture of the eight isolates were evaluated in media containing different concentrations of glucose (sufficient, insufficient, or no glucose). in comparison with the control medium, all of the individual isolates and mixtures of isolates could degrade oxalate in  all three groups (p<0.05). in most cases, the isolates growing in medium with 20  g/l of glucose had higher oxalate-degrading capacities than those growing in medium with 2.5 g/l of glucose or no glucose. the mixture of all isolates showed  higher oxalate-degrading capacity than the individual isolates and other mixtures. the oxalate-degrading capacities of the isolates were isolate dependent.

TI  == expression of immune-related genes in rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) induced by probiotic bacteria during lactococcus garvieae infection.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on the control of lactococcosis as well as to assess the impact of probiotics on the expression of immune-related genes in the head kidney and intestine of rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss). lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides, were administered orally at 10(6) cfu g(-)(1) feed to fish for 36 days. twenty-one days after the start of the feeding period, fish were challenged with lactococcus garvieae. only the fish fed the diet containing lb. plantarum showed significantly (p < 0.05) improved protection against l. garvieae compared to the control. subsequently, real-time pcr was employed to determine the mrna levels of il-1beta, il-8, il-10 and tnf-alpha in the head kidney, and il-8, tlr5 and igt in the intestine of the control and lb. plantarum groups. il-1beta, il-10 and tnf-alpha gene expression were significantly up-regulated by lb. plantarum. moreover, the mrna levels of il-10, il-8 and igt were significantly higher in the lb. plantarum group after l. garvieae infection, suggesting that lb. plantarum can stimulate the immune response of rainbow trout. pcr-dgge revealed no detectable levels of the probiotics or the pathogen present on the distal intestinal mucosa. these findings demonstrate that direct probiotic-host interactions with the intestine are not always necessary to induce host stimulatory responses which ultimately enhance disease resistance. furthermore, as l. garvieae did not colonise the intestinal tract, and therefore likely did not infect via this route, the antagonistic properties of the probiotic candidate towards l. garvieae were likely of little influence in mediating the improved disease resistance which could be attributed to the elevated immunological response.

TI  == a survey of the lactic acid bacteria isolated from serbian artisanal dairy product kajmak.
AB  == kajmak is an artisanal serbian dairy product made by fermentation of milk fat. overall, 374 bacterial isolates were collected from six kajmak samples of different ages produced in the households located in distinct regions of serbia.  in order to identify lactic acid bacteria present in chosen samples of kajmak, total 349 gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were analyzed. the recognition of isolates was performed by phenotypic characterization followed by  molecular identification using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna gene. leuconostoc mesenteroides and enterococcus faecium were the most frequently isolated species from kajmak samples. in contrast, leuconostocs and enterococci were found in bgmk3 and bgmk1 kajmak respectively, only after using enrichment technique for isolation suggesting they are present in low numbers in these kajmaks. lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis and lactococcus garvieae were also found in those samples but in lower proportion. results showed that lactobacillus plantarum, lb. paracasei and lb. kefiri were the most frequently isolated lactobacillus species in analyzed kajmaks.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == biodiversity of bacterial ecosystems in traditional egyptian domiati cheese.
AB  == bacterial biodiversity occurring in traditional egyptian soft domiati cheese was  studied by pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge) and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). bands were identified using a reference species database (j.-c. ogier et al., appl. environ. microbiol. 70:5628-5643, 2004); de novo bands having nonidentified migration patterns were identified by dna sequencing. results reveal a novel bacterial profile and extensive bacterial  biodiversity in domiati cheeses, as reflected by the numerous bands present in ttge and dgge patterns. the dominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) identified were as follows: leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactococcus garvieae, aerococcus viridans, lactobacillus versmoldensis, pediococcus inopinatus, and lactococcus lactis. frequent non-lab species included numerous coagulase-negative staphylococci, vibrio spp., kocuria rhizophila, kocuria kristinae, kocuria halotolerans, arthrobacter spp./brachybacterium tyrofermentans. this is the first time that the majority of these species has been identified in domiati cheese. nearly all the dominant and frequent bacterial species are salt tolerant, and several correspond to known marine bacteria. as domiati cheese contains 5.4 to 9.5% nacl, we suggest that these bacteria are likely to have an important role in the ripening process. this first systematic study of the microbial composition of domiati cheeses reveals great biodiversity and evokes a role for marine bacteria in determining cheese type.
