TI  == cow teat skin, a potential source of diverse microbial populations for cheese production.
AB  == the diversity of the microbial community on cow teat skin was evaluated using a culture-dependent method based on the use of different dairy-specific media, followed by the identification of isolates by 16s rrna gene sequencing. this was  combined with a direct molecular approach by cloning and 16s rrna gene sequencing. this study highlighted the large diversity of the bacterial community that may be found on teat skin, where 79.8% of clones corresponded to various unidentified species as well as 66 identified species, mainly belonging to those  commonly found in raw milk (enterococcus, pediococcus, enterobacter, pantoea, aerococcus, and staphylococcus). several of them, such as nonstarter lactic acid  bacteria (nslab), staphylococcus, and actinobacteria, may contribute to the development of the sensory characteristics of cheese during ripening. therefore,  teat skin could be an interesting source or vector of biodiversity for milk. variations of microbial counts and diversity between the farms studied have been  observed. moreover, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus devriesei, staphylococcus arlettae, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus equinus, clavibacter  michiganensis, coprococcus catus, or arthrobacter gandavensis commensal bacteria  of teat skin and teat canal, as well as human skin, are not common in milk, suggesting that there is a breakdown of microbial flow from animal to milk. it would then be interesting to thoroughly study this microbial flow from teat to milk.

TI  == urease assay and urease-producing species of anaerobes in the bovine rumen and human feces.
AB  == a growth medium and test were developed for rapid detection of urease in fermentative anaerobic bacteria. using nonselective rumen fluid roll-tube agar medium and the new test, it was confirmed that peptostreptococcus productus is often the most numerous urease-forming species in human feces. also, some fecal strains of ruminococcus albus, clostridium innocuum, and clostridium beijerinckii produced urease. single strains of fusobacterium prausnitzii, coprococcus catus,  and streptococcus mitis that were strongly ureolytic on isolation later lost this ability. urease activity was also detected in many strains of nonselectively isolated rumen species. they include succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, treponema sp., ruminococcus bromii (not previously known to be present in the rumen), butyrivibrio sp., bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides ruminicola, and p. productus.  most p. productus strains contain urease; however, the uniformity of this feature in the other species noted above is not known. the urease in many of these species was not detected if the growth medium contained 0.2% or more (each) yeast extract and trypticase.
