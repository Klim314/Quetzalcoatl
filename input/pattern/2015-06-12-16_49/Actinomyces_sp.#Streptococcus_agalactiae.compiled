TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - Bovine mastitis in selected areas of southern Ethiopia.
AB  - A study on bovine mastitis, designed to determine the causal agents, prevalence of infection and impact of risk factors in three cattle breeds, was conducted in selected areas of southern Ethiopia. A total of 307 lactating and non-lactating cows, of which 162 were indigenous Zebu, 85 Jersey and 60 Holstein-Friesian. were examined by clinical examination and the California mastitis (CMT) test. Of these, 40.4% were positive by CMT and bacteriology for clinical or subclinical mastitis, with prevalence rates of 37.1% and 62.9%, respectively. Out of 1133 quarters examined, 212 (18.7%) were found to be infected, 83 (39.21%) clinically and 129 (60.8%) subclinically. The prevalence of mastitis was significantly higher in Holstein-Friesian than in indigenous Zebu, in non-lactating cows than in lactating cows, in the early lactation stage than in the mid-lactation stage, in cows with lesions and/or tick infestation on skin of udder and/or teats than in cows without this factor, and in the wet season than in the dry season. Mastitis increased with parity number (R = 0.9). Of 248 CMT and clinically positive udder quarter samples analysed microbiologically, 212 were culturally positive for known mastitis pathogens and 36 were negative. Of the 199 positive samples. Staphylococcus accounted for 39.2%. Streptococcus for 23.6%, coliforms for 14.1%, Micrococcus and Bacillus species for 8.0% each and Actinomyces or Arcanobacterium (Corynebacterium) for 7.0%. It was concluded that there was a high prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis, mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli, in this study area.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - A review of bacteriological culture of removed intrauterine contraceptive devices.
AB  - A retrospective review of clinical and microbiological data was made, over an 18  month period, of intrauterine contraceptive devices removed and sent for examination. An association with symptoms at time of removal was found for Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus milleri, enterobacteria and obligate anaerobes. Thirty four per cent of IUDs yielded one or more Actinomycesspecies spp but no correlation with symptoms was found. In the small group of symptomatic patients who were followed up, no difference in outcome was observed between those who were treated with antibiotics and those who were not.
TI  - [Main infectious agents involved in the etiology of lung diseases of small ruminants in northern Cameroon].
AB  - Between 1990 and 1992, 91 necropsies of small ruminants affected with pulmonary illness led to the isolation of the following strains of Mycoplasma (M.): M. mycoides subsp. mycoides LC, M. ovipneumoniae, M. agalactiae, M. sp. type D2 and M. arginini. Eleven Pasteurella multocida strains (serotypes A1, A3, A5, A7 and D2) and 11 Pasteurella haemolytica strains (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) were isolated. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Bacillus sp. and Mycobacterium sp. were also isolated. Thirty-two antibiograms were performed on Pasteurella, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and Actinomyces pyogenes strains. Eighty eight p. cent were sensitive to penicillin G and oxytetracycline, and 84% to chloramphenicol; 50% were not sensitive to spiramycin and 47% to streptomycin. One Capripoxvirus strain was isolated on sheep. Pest of small ruminants (PPR) virus was detected by immunocapture ELISA test performed on some lung samples. Two serological surveys, one for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (898 goats), between 1991 and 1993, and one for PPR (902 sheep and goats) in 1993, were conducted in the North and Far North provinces. No antibody against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia was detected. Among the animals in the sample, PPR prevalence was 64 +/- 7% in the Far North province and 14 +/- 3% in the North province. Concerning control measures, a vaccination campaign against small ruminant pasteurellosis appears to be hardly feasible because of the antigenic diversity of the isolated Pasteurella strains. PPR is endemic especially in the Far North province. The efficiency of a vaccination campaign against PPR must be estimated with a field survey.
TI  - Effect of antibiotics treatment of in vitro fertilized bovine embryos to remove adhering bacteria.
AB  
TI  - The bactericidal effect of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. NAGase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of Actinomyces pyogenes (P less than 0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. Similarly NAGase treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees C. NAGase did not reduce the numbers of Escherichia coli or Enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. Since NAGase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.
TI  - [Milk chloride level as an indicator of bovine mastitis].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine an influence of udder infection on milk chloride level and on milk productivity of cows of black and white race. Bacteriological analysis was performed by bacterial isolation from milk collected in sterile conditions from single lobes of mammary gland. The study was aimed to detect the following bacteria: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actinomyces pyogenes, Enterobacteriaceae rods, Corynebacterium bovis, and Micrococcus sp. Milk chloride level was determined by burette method in 1250 milk samples collected from entire udder. Milk productivity was determined on the day of bacterial isolation. Statistical analysis of the results of the study on udder infection, milk chloride level, and milk productivity of mammary gland did reveal lack of a simple correlations between those parameters and in the indirect manner indicated an influence of inappropriate maintenance conditions of tested cows on the health condition of their udder. It seems possible that alkalosis and acidosis in cows, taken into consideration in discussion section, could constitute a factor influencing the frequency of mastitis incidence.
TI  - [Bacteriological findings in samples of milk from cows studied for the causative  agent of mastitis].
AB  - Milk samples (483,413 on the whole), collected from 237,026 cows, were investigated in the State Veterinary Institute at Pardubice in the period from 1983 to 1987. In the individual years, the proportion of cows whose milk contained the mastitis-inducing bacteria ranged from 18.0 to 24.8%, the average being 21.0%. Streptococcus agalactiae was identified most frequently as the causative agent of mastitis in the examined cows (6.4%); then followed Streptococcus dysgalactiae (3.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.4%), and Streptococcus uberis (1.9%). The presence of the beta-haemolytic streptococci with group antigens C, G and L was demonstrated in the milk of 720 cows (i. e. 0.3%) and the remaining species of streptococci were identified in 1.0% of the cows. Coliform microorganisms were detected in 0.6% and Actinomyces pyogenes in 0.1% of the cows. The remaining bacterial species were isolated from the milk of 3.6% of the cows. Coaglucase-negative staphylococci dominated in this group. Over the five years of study, the occurrence of Streptococcus agalactiae in the examined stocks declined from 10.8 to 3.5% but the occurrence of other streptococci and staphylococci increased.
TI  - Coaggregation between Actinomyces viscosus with Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - Interbacterial coaggregation between Actinomyces viscosus indigenous to the human mouth and Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae was studied. Fifteen of twenty-six strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and thirteen of thirty-one Streptococcus agalactiae showed a coaggregation with Actinomyces viscosus strain. The results show that the coaggregation mechanism required calcium and was dependent on pH. Some coaggregations were inhibited by 0.06 M. lactose and by 1 M. NaCl.
TI  - Mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. It also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. There is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Induction of bacterial L-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. Stable L-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to vancomycin. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), Str. pyogenes, Str. agalactiae, Str. bovis, Str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species and Lactobacillus species. There has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. Enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against Staph. aureus, Str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. The combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of Staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of Staph. epidermidis. It shows indifference against enterococci. Vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against Staph. aureus.
TI  - Interbacterial adherence between Actinomyces viscosus and strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Interbacterial adherence was sought between strains of Actinomyces viscosus indigenous to the human mouth and strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Six of nine strains of S. pyogenes, three of five strains of S. agalactiae, and two of four strains of P. aeruginosa were found to coaggregate with each of five strains of A. viscosus tested. Some coaggregation reactions were inhibited by 0.05 M lactose and were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive Actinomyces components. Such reactions appear to involve the galactosyl-binding adhesin previously described in type 2 fimbriae on A. viscosus. Other coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the pathogen. That such pathogen strains possessed an adhesin(s) was further suggested by the observation that they agglutinated human erythrocytes. The ability of coaggregation-positive and -negative strains of S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae to adhere to Actinomyces-coated agarose beads was also studied. Coaggregation-positive streptococcal strains attached in higher numbers to the Actinomyces-coated beads than did strains which were coaggregation negative. Lactose (0.05 M) inhibited the attachment of those streptococcal strains which coaggregated with A. viscosus in a lactose-sensitive manner. The adherence of those streptococcal strains whose coaggregation appeared to depend upon the galactosyl-binding adhesin of A. viscosus was also reduced by components of human saliva. Crude sonic extracts of coaggregation-positive streptococci or of P. aeruginosa were also effective in aggregating Actinomyces cells. The effect of lactose and of salivary components on this extract-induced aggregation of Actinomyces cells generally paralleled that observed in other assays. The apparent prevalence and diversity of adherent reactions between the pathogens studied and indigenous strains of A. viscosus suggest that some may affect host susceptibility to these infectious agents.
TI  - The antibacterial action of vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin inhibits the second stage of cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria. Furthermore, there is evidence that vancomycin also alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits ribonucleic acid synthesis. Stable L-phase variants are susceptible to vancomycin, but induction of bacterial L-phase variants with vancomycin is very difficult. Vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive cocci and bacilli, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (including multiply resistant strains). Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiply resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus bovis, viridans group Streptococcus, enterococcus, Clostridium species, diphtheroids, Listeria monocytogenes, Actinomyces species, and Lactobacillus species. Antimicrobial activity can be enhanced with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against S. aureus, S. bovis, enterococcus, and viridans Streptococcus. The combination of vancomycin and rifampin also has enhanced activity against S. aureus.
