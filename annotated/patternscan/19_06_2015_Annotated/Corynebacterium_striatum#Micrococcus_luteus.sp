TI  == comparison of the staphylococcus quickfish bc test with the tube coagulase test performed on positive blood cultures for evaluation and application in a clinical routine setting.
AB  == many studies demonstrate that delayed proper therapy in bloodstream infections caused by staphylococcus aureus increases the mortality rate, emphasizing the need to shorten the turnaround time for positive blood cultures. different techniques are currently available, from phenotypic methods to more complex tests such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof), real-time pcr (rt-pcr), and fluorescence in situ hybridization using peptide nucleic acid probes (pna fish). this study evaluated  the performance of the staphylococcus quickfish bc test (qft), a novel fish methodology, compared with the direct tube coagulase test (dtct) on blood cultures exhibiting gram-positive cocci in clusters. a total of 173 blood cultures collected from 128 different patients were analyzed using the dtct, evaluated after both 4 and 24 h, and the qft. a total of 179 isolates were identified using the vitek2 system. thirty-five out of 35 staphylococcus aureus were correctly identified by the qft (sensitivity = 100%), with a specificity of  100% (no green fluorescence was detected for strains different from s. aureus). the dtct was positive after 4 h for 28 out of the 35 samples (sensitivity = 80%)  and after 24 h for 31 out of the 35 samples (sensitivity = 88.57%). among the remaining 144 isolates, one was then identified as corynebacterium striatum and two as micrococcus luteus. qft identified 139 out of the 141 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (sensitivity = 98.58%), showing again a specificity of 100%  (no fluorescent red signals were detected for strains different from cons). we also discuss also the implementation process of this methodology in our setting,  with particular emphasis on the workflow and the cost-effectiveness.

TI  == plasmid-borne macrolide resistance in micrococcus luteus.
AB  == a plasmid designated pmec2 which confers resistance to erythromycin, other macrolides, and lincomycin was detected in micrococcus luteus strain maw843 isolated from human skin. curing of this approximately 4.2 kb plasmid from the host organism resulted in erythromycin sensitivity of the strain. introduction of pmec2 into a different m. luteus strain conferred erythromycin resistance upon this strain. macrolide resistance in m. luteus maw843 was an inducible trait. induction occurred at subinhibitory erythromycin concentrations of about 0.02-0.05 micro g ml(-1). erythromycin and oleandomycin were inducers, while spiramycin and tylosin exerted no significant inducer properties. with heterologous expression experiments in corynebacterium glutamicum, using hybrid plasmid constructs and deletion derivatives thereof, it was possible to narrow down the location of the plasmid-borne erythromycin-resistance determinant to a region of about 1.8 kb of pmec2. sequence analysis of the genetic determinant, designated erm(36), identified an orf putatively encoding a 281-residue protein with similarity to 23s rrna adenine n(6)-methyltransferases. erm(36) was most related (about 52-54% identity) to erythromycin-resistance proteins found in high-g+c gram-positive bacteria, including the (opportunistic) pathogenic corynebacteria corynebacterium jeikeium, c. striatum, c. diphtheriae and propionibacterium acnes. this is believed to be the first report of a plasmid-borne, inducible antibiotic resistance in micrococci. the possible role of non-pathogenic, saprophytic micrococci bearing antibiotic-resistance genes in  the spreading of these determinants is discussed.
