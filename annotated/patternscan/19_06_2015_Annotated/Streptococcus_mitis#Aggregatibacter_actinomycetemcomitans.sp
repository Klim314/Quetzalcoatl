TI  == interleukin-6 and microrna profiles induced by oral bacteria in human atheroma derived and healthy smooth muscle cells.
AB  == background: atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease with possible contributions from bacterial antigens. we aimed to investigate the role of oral bacteria as inducers of inflammatory cascades in smooth muscle cells from carotid endarterectomy patients (athsmcs) and healthy controls (hsmcs). findings: inactivated streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gorgonii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were used to stimulate inflammation in hsmcs and athsmcs. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha) was used as a positive control in all stimulations. interleukin-6 (il-6) levels were  determined from cell culture supernatants and microrna expression profiles from cells after 24 h of bacterial stimulation. genome wide expression (gwe) analyses  were performed after 5 h stimulation. all studied bacteria induced pro inflammatory il-6 production in both smcs. the most powerful inducer of il-6 was  a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.001). of the 84 studied mirnas, expression of 9 mirnas differed significantly (p </= 0.001) between hsmcs and athsmcs stimulated  with inactivated bacteria or tnfalpha. the data was divided into two groups: high il-6 producers (a. actinomytectemcomititans and tnfalpha) and low il-6 producers  (streptococcal strains and p. gingivalis). the expression of 4 mirnas (mir-181-5p, -186-5p, -28-5p and -155-5p) differed statistically significantly (p < 0.001) between healthy hsmcs and athsmcs in the low il-6 producer group. according to multidimensional scaling, two gene expression clusters were seen: one in hsmcs and one athsmcs. conclusions: our results suggest that inactivated oral bacteria induce inflammation that is differently regulated in healthy and atherosclerotic smcs.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == selected dietary (poly)phenols inhibit periodontal pathogen growth and biofilm formation.
AB  == periodontitis (pd) is a chronic infectious disease mediated by bacteria in the oral cavity. (poly)phenols (pps), ubiquitous in plant foods, possess antimicrobial activities and may be useful in the prevention and management of periodontitis. the objective of this study was to test the antibacterial effects  of selected pps on periodontal pathogens, on both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. selected pps (n = 48) were screened against streptococcus mitis (s. mitis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). the antibacterial potential of each compound was evaluated in terms  of planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (pmic) and planktonic minimum bactericidal concentration (pmbc) using standardized broth microdilution assays.  the most active pps were further tested for their effect on mono-species and multi-species biofilms using a colorimetric resazurin-based viability assay and scanning electron microscopy. of the 48 pps tested, 43 showed effective inhibition of planktonic growth of one or more test strains, of which curcumin was the most potent (pmic range = 7.8-62.5 mug ml(-1)), followed by pyrogallol (pmic range = 2.4-2500 mug ml(-1)), pyrocatechol (mic range = 4.9-312.5 mug ml(-1)) and quercetin (pmic range = 31.2-500 mug ml(-1)). at this concentration,  adhesion of curcumin and quercetin to the substrate also inhibited adhesion of s. mitis, and biofilm formation and maturation. while both curcumin and quercetin were able to alter architecture of mature multi-species biofilms, only curcumin-treated biofilms displayed a significantly reduced metabolic activity. overall, pps possess antibacterial activities against periodontopathic bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. further cellular and in vivo studies are necessary to confirm their beneficial activities and potential use in the prevention and or treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == development of an in vitro periodontal biofilm model for assessing antimicrobial  and host modulatory effects of bioactive molecules.
AB  == background: inflammation within the oral cavity occurs due to dysregulation between microbial biofilms and the host response. understanding how different oral hygiene products influence inflammatory properties is important for the development of new products. therefore, creation of a robust host-pathogen biofilm platform capable of evaluating novel oral healthcare compounds is an attractive option. we therefore devised a multi-species biofilm co-culture model  to evaluate the naturally derived polyphenol resveratrol (rsv) and gold standard  chlorhexidine (chx) with respect to anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: an in vitro multi-species biofilm containing s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans was created to represent a  disease-associated biofilm and the oral epithelial cell in okf6-tert2. cytotoxicity studies were performed using rsv and chx. multi-species biofilms were either treated with either molecule, or alternatively epithelial cells were  treated with these prior to biofilm co-culture. biofilm composition was evaluated and inflammatory responses quantified at a transcriptional and protein level. results: chx was toxic to epithelial cells and multi-species biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.2%. rsv did not effect multi-species biofilm composition, but was toxic to epithelial cells at concentrations greater than 0.01%. in co-culture, chx-treated biofilms resulted in down regulation of the inflammatory chemokine il-8 at both mrna and protein level. rsv-treated epithelial cells in co-culture were down-regulated in the release of il-8 protein, but not mrna. conclusions: chx possesses potent bactericidal properties, which may impact downstream inflammatory mediators. rsv does not appear to have bactericidal properties against multi-species biofilms, however it did appear to  supress epithelial cells from releasing inflammatory mediators. this study demonstrates the potential to understand the mechanisms by which different oral hygiene products may influence gingival inflammation, thereby validating the use  of a biofilm co-culture model.

TI  == the connection between ruptured cerebral aneurysms and odontogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: patients with ruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms have excess long-term mortality due to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases compared with general population. chronic inflammation is detected in ruptured intracranial aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysms and coronary artery plaques. bacterial infections have been suggested to have a role in the aetiology of atherosclerosis. bacteria have been detected both in abdominal and coronary arteries but their presence in intracranial aneurysms has not yet been properly studied. objective: the aim of this preliminary study was to assess the presence  of oral and pharyngeal bacterial genome in ruptured intracranial aneurysms and to ascertain if dental infection is a previously unknown risk factor for subarachnoid haemorrhage. methods: a total of 36 ruptured aneurysm specimens were obtained perioperatively in aneurysm clipping operations (n=29) and by autopsy (n=7). aneurysmal sac tissue was analysed by real time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes to detect bacterial dna from several oral species. immunohistochemical staining for bacterial receptors (cd14 and toll-like receptor-2 (tlr-2)) was performed from four autopsy cases. results: bacterial dna was detected in 21/36 (58%) of specimens. a third of the positive samples contained dna from both endodontic and periodontal bacteria. dna from endodontic  bacteria were detected in 20/36 (56%) and from periodontal bacteria in 17/36 (47%) of samples. bacterial dna of the streptococcus mitis group was found to be  most common. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola were the three most common periodontal pathogens. the highly  intensive staining of cd14 and tlr-2 in ruptured aneurysms was observed. conclusions: this is the first report showing evidence that dental infection could be a part of pathophysiology in intracranial aneurysm disease.

TI  == cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline  microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis  history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with  peri-implantitis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of myristica fragrans against oral pathogens.
AB  == myristica fragrans houtt is mostly cultivated for spices in penang island, malaysia. the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of flesh, mace and seed of myristica fragrans was evaluated the bactericidal potential against three gram-positive cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus mitis atcc 6249, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419) and three gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522, porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586). antibacterial activities of the extracts was determined by twofold serial microdilution, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.25 to  640 mg/ml and 0.075 to 40 mg/ml. the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was obtained by subculturing method. among all extracts tested, ethyl acetate extract of flesh has the highest significant inhibitory effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with mean mic value ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml; p = 0.017) and highest bactericidal effects at mean mbc value ranging from 0.625 mg/ml to 20 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml. while for seed and mace of myristica  fragrans, their ethanol extracts exhibited good antibacterial activity against both groups of test pathogens compared to its ethyl acetate extracts. all of the  extracts of myristica fragrans did not show any antibacterial activities against  fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586. thus, our study showed the potential effect of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed and mace of myristica fragrans to be new natural agent that can be incorporated in oral care products.

TI  == effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. we report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding rnas is stimulated. in the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. however, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. we also observed a significant upregulation of abc transport systems and putative transposases. changes in clusters of orthologous groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of  pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of  transcription factors were upregulated. finally, we identified several small noncoding rnas whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. these results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  == prunus mume extract exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogenic oral bacteria.
AB  == objectives: prunus mume is a common fruit in asia, which has been used in traditional chinese medicine. in this study, we focused on the antimicrobial properties of prunus mume extract against oral pathogens related to dental caries and periodontal diseases. study design: a total of 15 oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus acidophilus, p. gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and candida species were included in the study. initially, agar diffusion assay was performed to screen the antimicrobial activities of prunus mume extract. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were then determined for sensitive species. effect of prunus mume extract on human oral keratinocytes (hok) viability was also tested. result: in the agar diffusion assay, drug suspension of 2 g/ml was able to inhibit all the bacterial species tested, but not the fungal species. mic and mbc range of prunus mume extract against the oral bacteria was 0.15625-0.0003 g/ml and p. gingivalis being the most susceptible species. prune extract did not cause any detrimental effect on hok. conclusion: prunus mume extract may be a potential candidate for developing  an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with oral pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  == the inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. it was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on  inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. in this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production by human cells were investigated. the beneficial species, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the il-8 production triggered by a. actinomycetemcomitans. the inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. in contrast, the commensal streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum increased il-8 production by the host cells. these results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == interference with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans: colonization of epithelial cells under hydrodynamic conditions.
AB  == introduction: microbial interactions are considered to be important for bacterial colonization. interactions that inhibit colonization of pathogens could possibly  be used as a new treatment approach for periodontitis. the aim of this study was  to test this hypothesis on soft surfaces in vitro, taking into account the hydrodynamic forces continuously present in vivo. methods: cultured epithelial cells were precolonized with streptococcus sanguinis kth-4, streptococcus cristatus cc5a, streptococcus salivarius tove and streptococcus mitis bms before  aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans colonization. experiments were performed in a modified robbins-device-type flow cell. bacterial colonization and the number of epithelial cells were evaluated by microbial culturing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. results: the streptococci were able to inhibit a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization on soft tissue surfaces under flow conditions. statistically significant differences were found between streptococcal pretreatments and the controls, with the most pronounced effect caused by s. sanguinis. conclusion: these data confirm the possibility of applying beneficial  bacteria in periodontal treatment.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans adhesion inhibited in a flow cell.
AB  == introduction: microbial interactions are considered important in the adhesion process of pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity. this study addressed the hypothesis that a streptococcal biofilm influences the hard tissue colonization by the periodontopathogen aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans under hydrodynamic conditions. methods: the colonization of a green-fluorescent-protein-labelled a. actinomycetemcomitans strain on surfaces coated with a streptococcal biofilm, was monitored in real time using a confocal  laser scanning microscope-mounted flow cell. culture and quantitative polymerase  chain reaction data were obtained in parallel from a modified robbins device. results: colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans was inhibited by the four tested streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus mitis). the most inhibiting species was s. sanguinis. conclusion: these results confirmed the hypothesis that some bacterial species influence a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of hard surfaces in vitro under hydrodynamic conditions.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == bacteria interfere with a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization.
AB  == it is known that beneficial bacteria can suppress the emergence of pathogenic bacteria, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. this study examined the potential for a similar suppression of aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus)  actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells, due to its potential relevance in periodontal diseases. seven presumed beneficial bacteria were examined for their ability to interfere, exclude, or displace a. actinomycetemcomitans from epithelial cells in vitro. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius showed prominent inhibitory effects on either a. actinomycetemcomitans recovery or colonization. these results confirmed the hypothesis that bacterial interactions interfere with a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells in vitro, and demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguinis.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == effect of a stannous fluoride dentifrice on the sulcular microbiota: a prospective cohort study in subjects with various levels of periodontal inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. material and methods:  in the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated  moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. all four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a  day for one minute during a four-week test period. before and after the trial period, plaque indices (pii, silness and loe, 1964) and gingival indices (gi, loe and silness, 1963) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from  all patients at baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. these samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: as a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean pii at baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean pii at four weeks. no statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean gi at baseline and at four weeks. the microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2  and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. a. actinomyctemcomitans p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola. over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. in groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including s. mitis, s. intermedius, and s. sanguis (p < 0.01)  suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated  bacteria. conclusion: one minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. however, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. running head: effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

TI  == the presence of bacteria in the synovial fluid of the temporomandibular joint and clinical significance: preliminary study.
AB  == purpose: the objective of this study was to find any relation between the presence of specific bacterial species in the synovial fluid of the temporomandibular joint (tmj) and clinical parameters. patients and methods: we studied 43 patients (male-to-female ratio, 1:1.69; average age, 34.37 +/- 14.55 years). thirty-three patients had a displaced disc in the tmj (dd group), and 10  patients did not have a displaced disc of the tmj or any symptom related to tmj disorders (ndd group). clinical examinations were made to determine maximum mouth opening, joint sounds, previous trauma history, systemic disease, and tmj pain. six bacterial species that were reported in other studies were chosen to evaluate the presence of bacteria in the tmj for this study. results: mycoplasma genitalium was most frequently detected in synovial fluid (86.0%). staphylococcus aureus, mycoplasma fermentans/orale, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and streptococcus mitis were detected in 51.2%, 37.2%, 25.6%, and 7.0% of samples, respectively. beta-hemolytic streptococcus was not detected. the prevalence of s  aureus was significantly higher in the dd group than in the ndd group (p <.05). the patients who had m. fermentans/orale were 5.40 times more likely to be younger than 30 years than were those without m. fermentans/orale (p <.05). those with m. genitalium were 5.81 times more likely to be female than were those without m. genitalium (p <.05). conclusion: the presence of s. aureus in tmj synovial fluid was related to tmj disorder symptoms and clinical parameters seemed to be influenced by bacterial presence in tmj synovial fluid.

TI  == one of two human lactoferrin variants exhibits increased antibacterial and transcriptional activation activities and is associated with localized juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == the iron-binding protein lactoferrin is a ubiquitous and abundant constituent of  human exocrine secretions. lactoferrin inhibits bacterial growth by sequestering  essential iron and also exhibits non-iron-dependent antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory activities. all of  these non-iron-dependent activities are mediated by the highly charged n terminus of lactoferrin. in this study we characterized a lys/arg polymorphism at position 29 in the n-terminal region of human lactoferrin that results from a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 1 of the human lactoferrin gene. we expressed cdnas encoding both lactoferrin variants in insect cells and purified the two proteins by ion exchange chromatography. the two lactoferrin variants exhibited nearly identical iron-binding and iron-releasing activities and equivalent bactericidal activities against a strain of the gram-negative bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. when tested against the gram-positive species streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitis, however, lactoferrin containing lys at position 29 exhibited significantly greater bactericidal activity than did lactoferrin containing arg. in addition, the lys-containing lactoferrin stimulated bovine tracheal epithelial cells to synthesize much higher levels of tracheal antimicrobial peptide mrna than did the arg-containing variant. a genotyping assay that distinguished between the two alleles based on a polymorphic eari restriction site showed that the lys and arg alleles had frequencies of 24% and 76%, respectively, among 17 healthy human subjects, and 72% and 28%, respectively, among nine patients with localized juvenile periodontitis. our findings suggest that these two lactoferrin variants are functionally different and that these differences may contribute to the pathogenesis of localized juvenile periodontitis.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == the effect of herbal extracts in an experimental mouthrinse on established plaque and gingivitis.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to establish in vitro the inhibiting effect  of a herbal extract mixture on a selected number of micro-organisms and to test in vivo the effect of a mouthwash containing 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture on  plaque and gingivitis as compared to a minus active control mouthrinse. the herbal extract was a mixture of: juniperus communis (juniper), urtica dioca (nettle), achillaea millefolium (yarrow); 1:1:1. in the study, in-vitro, the effect of pure herbal extract mixture on acid production of streptococcus mutans  was tested and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the following micro-organisms were tested: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actynomyces viscosus, actynomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula. the mic-values for a. viscosus and p. gingivalis  were 100 mg/ml. the mic-values for a. naeslundii and a. actinomycetemcomitans were considerably lower (10 mg/ml). s. mitis was the most susceptible of the tested organisms to the extract with a mic value of 1 mg/ml. s. mutans, c. rectus, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum were not influenced by the extracts. no inhibitory effect of the 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture was observed on the acid production of s. mutans. for the study in-vivo, 45 volunteers were selected  on the basis of having moderate gingival inflammation. as efficacy parameters the plaque index, modified gingival index and angulated bleeding index were assessed. the subjects were randomly divided among 3 experimental groups (2x test and 1 'minus active' control). the participants were requested to rinse with 10 ml of mouthwash twice a day for a period of three months. after 6 weeks and 3 months, the same clinical indices as at baseline were recorded. the results show no difference between the two test groups and the control group. in conclusion, the  results of the present study have shown that the mixture of the 3 herbal extracts, juniperus communis, urtica dioca and achillaea millefolium when used in a mouthrinse has no effect on plaque growth and gingival health.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == pathogenicity of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens isolates in a wound chamber model in rabbits.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 14 isolates identified as prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens by serogrouping using monoclonal antibodies was compared in a tissue cage model in rabbits. seven strains from periodontal abscesses, 5 strains from deep periodontal pockets and 2 strains from gingivitis were tested in the animal model comprising 6 teflon tissue cages implanted on the back each of 34 rabbits. a total of 10(5)-10(8) cells of p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains were inoculated alone or together with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or streptococcus mitis. five strains of porphyromonas gingivalis were used as a reference. the infectivity was recorded as pus formation and log viable count in aspirated material for 3, 7 and 14 days. none of the prevotella strains inoculated in monoculture survived more than 3 days, and they had no capacity to produce abscess. p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains in combination with a. actinomycetemcomitans produced abscesses in 33-100% and with s. mitis in 42-100%. no difference in abscess formation or log viable count in samples after 14 days was recorded between serogroup i (p. intermedia) and serogroup ii and iii (p. nigrescens). the infectivity of p. intermedia or p. nigresceas strains did not differ whether they were isolated from periodontal abscess, periodontal pocket or gingivitis. p. intermedia and p.  nigrescens strains produced abscesses in combination with a facultative anaerobic strain and appears to have a similar pathogenicity in the wound chamber model in  rabbits.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
