TI  == influence of the periodontal status on the initial-biofilm formation on titanium  surfaces.
AB  == background: dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. the bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. purpose: the aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (ti) surfaces. materials and methods: ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study.  the subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed ti surfaces for 48 hours. microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the  ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each  of the study groups. however, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. treponema denticola, neisseria mucosa, eikenella corrodens, and tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions  of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis were detected on the ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. conclusions: the results obtained in this study  shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the ti implant.

TI  == microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. methods: microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. the presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (p </= .05). results:  enterococcus faecium (36%), streptococcus epidermidis (36%), eubacterium saburreum (28%), parvimonas micra (28%), streptococcus sanguis (28%), capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), leptotrichia buccalis (28%), enterococcus faecalis (28%), and staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of treponema socranskii (3%), fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). the highest mean levels were found for the following species: e. faecium, dialister pneumosintes, staphylococcus epidermidis and helicobacter pylori. there was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). a  positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the  levels of gram-negative and rod species (p < .05). conclusions: the microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting e. faecium and s. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. no correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical  findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.

TI  == phototargeting human periodontal pathogens in vivo.
AB  == the effects of blue light at 455 nm were investigated on the bacterial composition of human dental plaque in vivo. eleven subjects who refrained from brushing for 3 days before and during phototherapy participated in the study. light with a power density of 70 mw/cm(2) was applied to the buccal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth on one side of the mouth twice daily for 2 min over a period of 4 days. dental plaque was harvested at baseline and again at the end of 4 days from eight posterior teeth on both the exposed side and unexposed sides of the mouth. microbiological changes were monitored by checkerboard dna probe analysis of 40 periodontal bacteria. the proportions of black-pigmented species porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced on  the exposed side from their original proportions by 25 and 56 %, respectively, while no change was observed to the unexposed side. five other species showed the greatest proportional reduction of the light-exposed side relative to the unexposed side. these species were streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, and capnocytophaga sputigena. at the same time, the percentage of  gingival areas scored as being red decreased on the side exposed to light from 48 to 42 %, whereas the percentage scored as red increased on the unexposed side from 53 to 56 %. no adverse effects were found or reported in this study. the present study proposes a new method to modify the ecosystem in dental plaque by phototherapy and introduces a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.
