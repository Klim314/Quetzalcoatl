TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == prevalence of nim genes in anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated in south africa.
AB  == this study investigated the prevalence of nim genes (proposed to encode a 5-nitroimidazole resistance product) in 64 anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria. employing universal nim gene primers, 458-bp amplified fragments were recorded as presumptive positives in 22/64 strains at an annealing temperature of 52 degrees c and 15/64 strains at 62 degrees c, of which seven were propionibacteria. dna sequencing confirmed the presence of nima genes in propionibacterium spp. (five strains), actinomyces odontolyticus (one strain), prevotella bivia (one strain) and clostridium bifermentans (one strain) and nimb  genes from five strains of bacteroides fragilis. nima genes were predominant in propionibacteria indicating a potential nima gene source in anaerobic environments.
