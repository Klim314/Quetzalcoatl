in vitro evaluation of antibacterial activities and anti-inflammatory effects of  bifidobacterium spp. addressing acne vulgaris.
the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect of bifidobacterium spp. in the first part of the study, the antibacterial activities of live and sonicated cells, from a total of 23 bifidobacterium species, on the growth of 5 different strain of staphylococcus aureus. six strains, of sonicated bifidobacterium, exhibited antibacterial activity against staphylococci samples, and seven bifidobacterium strains exhibited antibacterial activity on the growth of s. aureus s.p.-n2. in the second part of the study, we tested the antimicrobial activity, of bifidobacterium against propionibacterium acne kctc3320, using the co-culture method. the loss of p. acnes viability, caused by b. adolescentis spm0308 and b. longum spm1207, was 84% and 75%, respectively (*p < 0.05). in the third part of the study, the anti-inflammatory activity of b. adolescentis spm0308 and b. longum spm1207 were assessed; nitric oxide (no), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), production were tested using the murine macrophage raw 264.7 cell line. treatment of raw 264.7 cells, with bifidobacterium, decreased production of no and tnf-alpha rather than lps (100 ng/ml) treatment. the results suggest that b. adolescentis spm0308 could be used as an effective control for p. acnes kctc3320, and s. aureus, and reduce the risk of acne vulgaris development. we suggest that b. adolescentis spm0308 may be a useful probiotic microorganism, for prevention of acne vulgaris, without adverse effects.
[the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.
[the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b. longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.
