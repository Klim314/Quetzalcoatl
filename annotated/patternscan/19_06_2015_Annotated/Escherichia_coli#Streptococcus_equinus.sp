TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == five cases of recurrent meningitis associated with chronic strongyloidiasis.
AB  == although meningitis secondary to chronic strongyloidiasis is a rare complication, it is associated with a high mortality rate. recurrent meningitis can occur if the underlying parasitic infection is left untreated. we report five cases of recurrent meningitis related to chronic strongyloidiasis that were associated with human t-lymphotropic virus type 1 (htlv-1) infection. common causative organisms are escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, and klebsiella pneumonia. one patient died during the second episode of meningitis. three patients showed significant gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms before developing headache  and fever. in four cases, patients developed multiple recurrences even with the treatment of thiabendazol. ivermectin seems to be a better agent compared with thiabendazol to achieve eradication of strongyloidiasis.

TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == production of itaconic acid in escherichia coli expressing recombinant alpha-amylase using starch as substrate.
AB  == several studies on fermentative production of a vinyl monomer itaconic acid from  hydrolyzed starch using aspergillus terreus have been reported. herein, we report itaconic acid production by escherichia coli expressing recombinant alpha-amylase, using soluble starch as its sole carbon source. to express alpha-amylase in e. coli, we first constructed recombinant plasmids expressing alpha-amylases by using cell surface display technology derived from two amylolytic bacteria, bacillus amyloliquefaciens nbrc 15535(t) and streptococcus bovis nric 1535. the recombinant alpha-amylase from s. bovis (sba) showed activity at 28 degrees c, which is the optimal temperature for production of itaconic acid, while alpha-amylase from b. amyloliquefaciens displayed no noticeable activity. e. coli cells expressing sba produced 0.15 g/l itaconic acid after 69 h cultivation under ph-stat conditions, using 1% starch as the sole carbon source. in fact, e. coli cells expressing sba had similar growth rates when grown in the presence of 1% glucose or starch, thereby highlighting the expression of an active alpha-amylase that enabled utilization of starch to produce itaconic acid in e. coli.

TI  == [recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: the bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  == introduction: recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. the causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. patients and  methods: retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. results: case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (mri) after 2 episodes of haemophilus influenzae meningitis. surgical repair after third recurrence. case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by mri with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to streptococcus pneumoniae. ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. case 3: girl with meningitis due to staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. mri shows occipital dermal sinus  requiring excision. complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. case 4: child with meningitis due to streptococcus bovis at 9 days and enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to citrobacter freundii and e. faecium later on. spinal mri led to the diagnosis of currarino syndrome with csf fistula, which was surgically repaired. the 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. conclusions: in patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. the isolated microorganism should help to locate it. it is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. the definitive treatment is usually surgical.

TI  == cloning, expression, and purification of a new antibacterial substance gene from  larvae of musca domestica (diptera: muscidae).
AB  == musca domestica l. (diptera: muscidae), the housefly, exhibits unique immune defenses and can produce antibacterial substances upon stimulation with bacteria. on the basis of the cdna library constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization method, a 1188-bp antibacterial substance gene, which we named as566, was amplified by rapid amplification of cdna ends from m. domestica larva  stimulated with salmonella pullorum (enterobacteriaceae: salmonella). in this study, the full-length as566 gene was cloned and inserted into a his-tagged escherichia coli (enterobacteriaceae: escherichia) prokaryotic expression system  to enable production of the recombinant protein. the recombinant as566 protein was purified in denatured form from inclusion bodies and renatured to obtain functionally active as566 protein. the bacteriostatic activity of the recombinant purified as566 protein was assessed using the oxford plate assay system and the results indicated that as566 had antibacterial activity against six bacteria, including an e. coli clinical isolate, s. pullorum, streptococcus bovis (streptococcaceae: streptococcus), streptococcus suis, and staphylococcus aureus  (staphylococcaceae: staphylococcus) in vitro. the antibacterial activity of as566 toward gram- bacteria was two times greater than that against gram+ bacteria. the sequencing results and blast analysis showed that the antibacterial substance gene as566 was not homologous to any other antibacterial substance genes in genbank. the antibacterial mechanisms of the newly discovered as566 protein warrant further study.

TI  == a study on the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved  in skin and meibomian gland lesions of demodectic mange in cattle.
AB  == the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected  animals was investigated. demodex bovis and d. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. the mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a)) and opportunistic organisms (proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and moraxella bovis and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes (group a) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent  microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. the "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.

TI  == effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on probability of conception in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis (cm), occurring in different weekly intervals before or after artificial insemination (ai), on the probability of conception in holstein cows.  clinical mastitis occurring in weekly intervals from 6 wk before until 6 wk after ai was modeled. the first 4 ai in a cow's lactation were included. the following  categories of pathogens were studied: streptococcus spp. (comprising streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, and other streptococcus spp.);  staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns); escherichia coli;  klebsiella spp.; cases with cm signs but no bacterial growth (above the level that can be detected from our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); and other pathogens [including citrobacter, yeasts, trueperella pyogenes, gram-negative bacilli (i.e., gram-negative organisms other than e. coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter, and citrobacter), corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium spp., pasteurella, enterococcus, pseudomonas, mycoplasma, prototheca, and others]. other factors included in the model were parity (1, 2, 3, 4 and higher), season of ai (winter, spring, summer, autumn), day in lactation of first ai, farm, and other non-cm diseases (retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum). data from 90,271 ai in 39,361 lactations in 20,328 cows collected from 2003/2004  to 2011 from 5 new york state dairy farms were analyzed in a generalized linear mixed model with a poisson distribution. the largest reductions in probability of conception were associated with cm occurring in the week before ai or in the 2 wk following ai. escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. had the greatest adverse effects on probability of conception. the probability of conception for a cow with any combination of characteristics may be calculated based on the parameter  estimates. these findings may be helpful to farmers in assessing reproduction in  their dairy cows for more effective cow management.

TI  == characterization of rumen bacterial strains isolated from enrichments of rumen content in the presence of propolis.
AB  == propolis presents many biological properties, including antibacterial activities, and has been proposed as an additive in ruminant nutrition. twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from enrichments of brazilian cow rumen contents in  the presence of different propolis extracts (llos), were characterized using phenotyping and 16s rrna identification. seven strains were assigned to streptococcus sp., most likely s. bovis, and were all degrading starch. one amylolytic lactate-utilizing strain of selenomonas ruminantium was also found. two strains of clostridium bifermentans were identified and showed proteolytic activity. two strains were assigned to mitsuokella jalaludinii and were saccharolytic. one strain belonged to a bacillus species and seven strains were affiliated with escherichia coli. all of the 20 strains were able to use many sugars, but none of them were able to degrade the polysaccharides carboxymethylcellulose and xylans. the effect of three propolis extracts (llos b1, c1 and c3) was tested on the in vitro growth of four representative isolates  of s. bovis, e. coli, m. jalaludinii and c. bifermentans. the growth of s. bovis, e. coli and m. jalaludinii was not affected by the three propolis extracts at 1 mg ml(-1). c. bifermentans growth was completely inhibited at this llos concentration, but this bacterium was partially resistant at lower concentrations. llos c3, with the lower concentration of phenolic compounds, was  a little less inhibitory than b1 and c1 on this strain.

TI  == pathogen-specific effects on milk yield in repeated clinical mastitis episodes in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (cm) cases due to different pathogens on milk yield in holstein cows. the first 3 cm cases in a cow's lactation were modeled. eight categories of pathogens were included: streptococcus spp.; staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns); escherichia coli; klebsiella spp.; cases with cm signs but no bacterial growth (above the level detectable by our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample, and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); other pathogens that may be treated with antibiotics (included citrobacter, corynebacterium bovis, enterobacter, enterococcus, pasteurella, pseudomonas; "other treatable"); and other pathogens not successfully treated with antibiotics (trueperella pyogenes, mycoplasma, prototheca, yeasts; "other not treatable"). data from 38,276 lactations in cows from 5 new york state dairy herds, collected from 2003-2004 until 2011, were analyzed. mixed models with an autoregressive correlation structure (to account for correlation among the repeated measures of milk yield within a lactation) were estimated. primiparous (lactation 1) and multiparous (lactations 2 and 3) cows were analyzed separately, as the shapes of their lactation curves differed.  primiparas were followed for up to 48 wk of lactation and multiparas for up to 44 wk. fixed effects included parity, calving season, week of lactation, cm (type, case number, and timing of cm in relation to milk production cycle), and other diseases (milk fever, retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum).  herd was modeled as a random effect. clinical mastitis was more common in multiparas than in primiparas. in primiparas, streptococcus spp. occurred most frequently as the first case. in multiparas, e. coli was most common as the first case. in subsequent cases, cm cases with no specific growth or contamination were most common in both parity groups. the hazard of cm increased with case number. mastitic cows were generally higher producers before the cm episode than their nonmastitic herdmates. milk loss varied with pathogen and case number. in primiparas, the greatest losses were associated with e. coli and "other not treatable" organisms. in multiparas, the greatest losses were associated with klebsiella spp. and "other not treatable" organisms. milk loss was not associated with occurrence of cns. the findings may help farmers to make optimal management  decisions for their cows.

TI  == l-lactate production from seaweed hydrolysate of laminaria japonica using metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == renewable and carbon neutral, marine algal biomass could be an attractive alternative substrate for the production of biofuel and various biorefinery products. thus, the feasibility of brown seaweed (laminaria japonica) hydrolysate as a carbon source was investigated here for l-lactate production. this work reports the homofermentative route for l-lactate production by introducing streptococcus bovis/equinus l-lactate dehydrogenase in an engineered escherichia  coli strain where synthesis of the competing by-product was blocked. the engineered strain utilized both glucose and mannitol present in the hydrolysate under microaerobic condition and produced 37.7 g/l of high optical purity l-lactate at 80 % of the maximum theoretical value. the result shown in this study implies that algal biomass would be as competitive with lignocellulosic biomass in terms of lactic acid production and that brown seaweed can be used as  a feedstock for the industrial production of other chemicals.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == milk haptoglobin, milk amyloid a, and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity in bovines with naturally occurring clinical mastitis diagnosed with a quantitative  pcr test.
AB  == the associations between quantitative bacteriological results from a real-time pcr test and concentrations of acute-phase proteins (app) and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) activity in milk in naturally occurring  clinical mastitis were investigated. milk app concentrations and nagase activity  in clinical mastitis caused by different udder pathogens were studied. the associations between the severity of the clinical signs and concentrations of app and nagase activity were estimated. milk samples from 281 cases of clinical mastitis were collected from 3 estonian dairy farms and analyzed by pcr to identify pathogens. twenty-seven samples out of 281 (9.6%) were pcr negative. milk samples containing 4 or more bacterial species (n=28) were considered possibly contaminated and excluded from all further analyses. in total, 443 bacterial identifications were made from the remaining 226 milk samples. a single bacterial species was detected in 68 samples (30.1%), 2 species were detected in  99 samples (43.8%), and 3 species were detected in 59 (26.1%) samples. to determine the inflammatory response in the udder, the concentrations of milk amyloid a (maa) and haptoglobin (hp) and nagase activity in the milk were analyzed. a significant positive association was found between the severity of the clinical signs and inflammatory markers in the milk. milk amyloid a and hp concentrations and nagase activity were significantly higher in samples with large quantities of bacterial dna from escherichia coli or streptococcus dysgalactiae compared with milk samples not containing those species. large quantities of bacterial dna from trueperella pyogenes or streptococcus uberis in  the milk were associated with elevated concentrations of hp and high nagase activity, but not with increased maa concentrations. milk samples containing corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci had significantly lower concentrations of maa and hp and lower nagase activity compared with samples where these species were not detected. it can be concluded that concentrations of app and nagase activity in the milk were associated with the quantity of bacterial dna in the milk samples.

TI  == relationship between concentration of lingual antimicrobial peptide and somatic cell count in milk of dairy cows.
AB  == lingual antimicrobial peptide (lap) belongs to the beta-defensin family in cattle and is found in milk. lap concentrations increase in milk from mastitic udders; however, the relationship between lap concentrations and the somatic cell count (scc) in milk remains to be elucidated in detail. therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between lap concentrations and the scc in bovine milk to assess whether lap may be used as an indicator of scc. milk was collected from 66 udders showing various sccs. the scc and lap concentrations were measured in the milk. a significantly higher lap concentration was observed  in milk having 500-5000 x 10(3)cells/ml and >5000 x 10(3)cells/ml scc groups than in lower scc groups (<50 x 10(3)cells/ml and 50-500 x 10(3)cells/ml). a significantly positive correlation between lap concentrations and sccs in milk was observed (r=0.68). in milk samples with >26 nm of lap, 92.0% of milk samples  had high sccs (>200 x 10(3)cells/ml). the concentration of lap in milk infected with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and  escherichia coli was significantly higher than that in uninfected milk. these results suggest that the concentration of lap can be a useful indicator of the scc in dairy cows.

TI  == occurrence of bacteriuria in 18 catheterised cats with obstructive lower urinary  tract disease: a pilot study.
AB  == the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections in cats catheterised for an obstructive lower urinary tract disease (lutd) has not previously been evaluated. the objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of significant bacteriuria in cats with obstructive lutd managed for 48 h with a closed urine collection system. eighteen male cats admitted for a non-infectious obstructive lutd were evaluated. this was a prospective study. a standard protocol was used for aseptic catheter placement and maintenance. three  urine samples were collected from each animal through the catheter immediately after placement, 24 h after placement and just before removal. all samples underwent complete urinalysis, including bacterial culture. catheter tips were tested by bacterial culture. six cats (33.3%) developed significant bacteriuria during catheterisation. the causative bacteria were common feline uropathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus species) in five cases, and streptococcus bovis in one. one cat developed a fungal infection. the presence of bacteria in urinary sediment was correlated strongly with positive urine culture results. the catheter tips from 10/18 cats (55.5%) were positive for culture. the positive predictive value of a positive culture from the urinary catheter tip was 87.5%. the specificity was 53.8%. the same infectious agents were cultured from both urine and catheter tip in six cases. in summary, one-third of cats developed significant bacteriuria during catheterisation. silent bacteriuria could not be clearly differentiated from true urinary tract infection. the presence of bacteria in the urinary sediment was strongly indicative of bacteriuria. the specificity of urinary catheter tip culture was low.

TI  == efficient synthesis of l-lactic acid from glycerol by metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == background: due to its abundance and low-price, glycerol has become an attractive carbon source for the industrial production of value-added fuels and chemicals. this work reports the engineering of e. coli for the efficient conversion of glycerol into l-lactic acid (l-lactate). results: escherichia coli strains have previously been metabolically engineered for the microaerobic production of d-lactic acid from glycerol in defined media by disrupting genes that minimize the synthesis of succinate, acetate, and ethanol, and also overexpressing the respiratory route of glycerol dissimilation (glpk/glpd). here, further rounds of  rationale design were performed on these strains for the homofermentative production of l-lactate, not normally produced in e. coli. specifically, l-lactate production was enabled by: 1), replacing the native d-lactate specific  dehydrogenase with streptococcus bovis l-lactate dehydrogenase (l-ldh), 2) blocking the methylglyoxal bypass pathways to avoid the synthesis of a racemic mixture of d- and l-lactate and prevent the accumulation of toxic intermediate, methylglyoxal, and 3) the native aerobic l-lactate dehydrogenase was blocked to prevent the undesired utilization of l-lactate. the engineered strain produced 50 g/l of l-lactate from 56 g/l of crude glycerol at a yield 93% of the theoretical  maximum and with high optical (99.9%) and chemical (97%) purity. conclusions: this study demonstrates the efficient conversion of glycerol to l-lactate, a microbial process that had not been reported in the literature prior to our work. the engineered biocatalysts produced l-lactate from crude glycerol in defined minimal salts medium at high chemical and optical purity.

AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == [fever as the presenting manifestation of colon cancer: a case series of 11 patients].
AB  == introduction: fever happens frequently in colon cancer but it is rarely the presenting manifestation. patients and methods: we report a case series of patients with colon cancer revealed by fever in the three military hospitals in paris. results: of the 11 patients studied, seven were men and four were women, and their mean age was 70 years. cancer was localized in the sigmoid colon (n=6), left colon (n=3) and right colon (n=2). cancer staging (uicc tnm classification 2002) was respectively ptis (n=1), i (n=4), ii (n=3) and iii (n=3). fever was the only reason for admission and two patients had a recurrent fever of unknown origin. all patients but one had bacterial infection. blood cultures grew up in six cases, escherichia coli (n=3), streptococcus gallolyticus (ex bovis) (n=2) and anaerobic bacteria (n=1). there was one case of infective endocarditis caused by s. gallolyticus. imaging showed a liver abscess (n=3) and a colon cancer complicated by an abscess (n=3). in seven patients, a familial history of colon cancer and symptoms of underlying colic disease were present (neglected rectal bleeding, iron deficiency anaemia, clinical evidence of an abdominal mass). conclusions: fever may reveal colon cancer at an early stage. its main cause is a bacterial infection, such as bacteremia or abscess. fever of unknown origin is a  rare presentation. detailed history, careful clinical examination and analysis of imaging contribute to recommend the prescription of colonoscopy.

TI  == molecular characterization of a novel mosaic tet(s/m) gene encoding tetracycline  resistance in foodborne strains of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the presence of antibiotic-resistance (ar) genes in foodborne bacteria of enteric origin represents a relevant threat to human health in the case of opportunistic  pathogens, which can reach the human gut through the food chain. streptococcus bovis is a human opportunistic pathogen often associated with infections in immune-compromised or cancer patients, and it can also be detected in the environment, including fermented foods. we have focused on the molecular characterization of a tetracycline (tet)-resistance gene present in 39 foodborne  isolates of s. bovis phenotypically resistant to this drug. the gene was identified as a novel tet(s/m) fusion, encoding a mosaic protein composed of the  n-terminal 33 amino acids of tet(s), in-frame with the tet(m) coding sequence. heterologous expression of the mosaic gene was found to confer tet resistance upon escherichia coli recipients. moreover, the tet(s/m) gene was found to be transcriptionally inducible by tet under the endogenous tet(s) promoter in both s. bovis and e. coli. nucleotide sequencing of the surrounding genomic region of  16.2 kb revealed large blocks of homology with the genomes of streptococcus infantarius and lactococcus lactis. a subregion of about 4 kb containing mosaic tet(s/m) was flanked by two copies of the is1216 mobile element. pcr amplification with primers directed outwards from the tet(s/m) gene identified the presence of a 4.3 kb circular form corresponding to the intervening chromosomal region between the two is1216 elements, but lacking a replication origin. the circular element shared extensive overall homology with a region of the multidrug-resistance plasmid pk214 from lc. lactis, containing tet(s), as well as the is1216 transposase-containing element and intervening non-coding sequences. linear reconstruction of the insertion events likely to have occurred  within this genomic region, inferred from sequence homology, provides further evidence of the chromosomal rearrangements that drive genomic evolution in complex bacterial communities such as the gut and food microbiota.

TI  == catalytic efficiency diversification of duplicate beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases from neocallimastix patriciarum j11.
AB  == four types of beta-1,3-1,4 glucanase (beta-glucanase, ec 3.2.1.73) genes, designated bgla13, bgla16, bgla51, and bglm2, were found in the cdna library of neocallimastix patriciarum j11. all were highly homologous with each other and demonstrated a close phylogenetic relationship with and a similar codon bias to streptococcus equinus. the presence of expansion and several predicted secondary  structures in the 3' untranslated regions (3'utrs) of bgla16 and bglm2 suggest that these two genes were duplicated recently, whereas bgla13 and bgla16, which contain very short 3'utrs, were replicated earlier. these findings indicate that  the beta-glucanase genes from n. patriciarum j11 may have arisen by horizontal transfer from the bacterium and subsequent duplication in the rumen fungus. beta-glucanase genes of streptococcus equinus, ruminococcus albus 7, and n. patriciarum j11 were cloned and expressed by escherichia coli. the recombinant beta-glucanases cloned from s. equinus, r. albus 7, and n. patriciarum j11 were endo-acting and had similar substrate specificity, but they demonstrated different properties in other tests. the specific activities and catalytic efficiency of the bacterial beta-glucanases were also significantly lower than those of the fungal beta-glucanases. our results also revealed that the activities and some characteristics of enzymes were changed during the horizontal gene transfer event. the specific activities of the fungal beta-glucanases ranged from 26,529 to 41,209 u/mg of protein when barley-derived beta-glucan was used as the substrate. they also demonstrated similar ph and temperature optima, substrate specificity, substrate affinity, and hydrolysis patterns. nevertheless, bgla16 and bglm2, two recently duplicated beta-glucanases, showed much higher k(cat) values than others. these results support the notion that duplicated beta-glucanase genes, namely, bgla16 and bglm2, increase the reaction efficiency  of beta-glucanases and suggest that the catalytic efficiency of beta-glucanase is likely to be a criterion determining the evolutionary fate of duplicate forms in  n. patriciarum j11.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in europe.
AB  == a monitoring programme conducted in europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (brd) cases between 2002 and 2008. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. for respiratory pathogens, pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (mic</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of m haemolytica strains were resistant (mic>/=4  microg/ml). histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). mycoplasma bovis mic (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. for mastitis pathogens, the majority of escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568  and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with mic centred on 0.25 microg/ml.  streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with mic centred on 1 microg/ml. marbofloxacin mic for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published mic results.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == the effect of recurrent episodes of clinical mastitis caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and other organisms on mortality and culling in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of recurrent episodes of  different types of clinical mastitis (cm) caused by gram-positive (streptococcus  spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp.) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, enterobacter, pseudomonas) bacteria, and other organisms (arcanobacterium pyogenes, mycoplasma, corynebacterium bovis, yeast, miscellaneous) on the probability of mortality and culling in holstein dairy cows. data from 30,233 lactations in cows of 7 dairy farms in new york state were analyzed. cows were followed for the first 10 mo in lactation, or until death or  culling occurred, or until the end of our study period. generalized linear mixed  models with a poisson error distribution were used to study the effects of recurrent cases of the different types of cm and several other factors (herd, parity, month of lactation, current year and season, profitability, net replacement cost, other diseases) on cows' probability of death (model 1) or being culled (model 2). primiparous and multiparous cows were modeled separately  because they had different risks of mortality and culling and potentially different cm effects on mortality and culling. approximately 30% of multiparous cows had at least one case of cm in lactation compared with 16.6% of primiparous  cows. multipara also had higher lactational incidence risks of second (10.7%) and third (4.4%) cases than primipara (3.7% and 1.1%, respectively). for primipara, cm increased the probability of death, with each successive case occurring in a month being increasingly lethal. in multipara, gram-negative cm increased the probability of death, especially when the gram-negative case was the first or second cm case in lactation. primiparous cows with cm were more likely to be culled after cm than if they did not have cm, particularly after a second or third case. in multipara, any type of cm increased the probability of being culled. gram-negative cm cases were associated with the numerically highest risk  of culling.

TI  == diagnosis of intramammary infection in samples yielding negative results or minor pathogens in conventional bacterial culturing.
AB  == up to half of quarter milk samples submitted for mastitis diagnosis are culture-negative results or lead to identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacterium bovis in conventional culturing, the so-called minor pathogens. the interpretation and usefulness of these results in terms of udder and animal health management is limited, even though the amount of resources spent is relatively high. this work aimed to test two methods of analysis of milk samples with the goal of increasing detection of intramammary pathogens. in the first study, 783 milk samples were processed in duplicate: before and after freezing at -20 degrees c for 24 h, using standard bacteriological techniques. there was a significant difference between the two methods with samples frozen for 24 h yielding significantly fewer gram-positive catalase-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive bacilli and significantly more samples leading to no growth, than samples before freezing. the number of samples yielding gram-positive catalase-negative cocci was not significantly affected by freezing. in the second study, a real-time pcr-based test was performed on milk samples with an individual quarter somatic cell count  above 500,000 cells/ml that were either negative (n=51 samples) or that led to the isolation of minor pathogens in culturing: corynebacterium bovis (n=79 samples) or non-aureus staphylococci (nas, n=32). a mastitis pathogen, beyond the result obtained with standard bacteriology, was detected on 47% of the no-growth  samples, on 35% of the samples from which c. bovis had been isolated and on 25% of the samples from which nas had been isolated. the most commonly detected major pathogen was escherichia coli, followed by streptococcus uberis, arcanobacterium  pyogenes/peptoniphilus indolicus and streptococcus dysgalactiae. these results suggest that simply freezing milk samples for 24 h does not increase the detection of intramammary bacteria in milk samples and therefore should not be recommended. however, use of the real-time pcr-based test may be useful in diagnosing intramammary infections when milk samples with high somatic cell counts are culture-negative or when culturing results in the detection of minor pathogens.

AB  == the heterogenetic and sporadic nature of colorectal cancer has led to many epidemiological associations with causes of this disease. as our understanding of the underlying molecular processes in colorectal-cancer develops, the concept of  microbial-epithelial interactions as an oncogenic trigger might provide a plausible hypothesis for the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. by contrast with  other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (gastric carcinoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid-tissue lymphoma), a direct causal link between microbial infection (bacteria and viruses) and colorectal carcinoma has not been established. studies support the involvement of these organisms in oncogenesis, however, in colorectal cancer, clinical data are lacking. here, we discuss current evidence (both in vitro and clinical studies), and focus on a putative role for bacterial and viral pathogens as a cause of colorectal cancer.

AB  == bovicin hj50, a lantibiotic produced by streptococcus bovis hj50, is featured by  the presence of a disulfide bridge. this study described a simplified in vitro synthetic strategy for producing bovicin hj50 totally based on escherichia coli expression system. in this strategy termed as semi-in vitro biosynthesis (sivb),  prepeptide bova and modification enzyme bovm were co-expressed to generate posttranslationally modified bova. then a specific protease bovt150 was employed  to remove the leader peptide in vitro and produce biologically active bovicin hj50. via sivb, a series of ring-broken bovicin mutants c13a, c21a, c29a and t10a/c32a were prepared by introducing site-directed mutations into bova gene. further, we analyzed the bridging patterns of these mutants through chemical modification and successfully clarified the bridging pattern of bovicin hj50. the results showed that two thioether bridges exist between thr8 and cys13, and thr10 and cys32, respectively, and that the disulfide bond bridging cys21 and 29 is very relevant for the antimicrobial activity of bovicin hj50. this is the first study that reports the bridging pattern of bovicin hj50.

TI  == rumen microbiome composition determined using two nutritional models of subacute  ruminal acidosis.
AB  == subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) is a metabolic disease in dairy cattle that occurs during early and mid-lactation and has traditionally been characterized by low rumen ph, but lactic acid does not accumulate as in acute lactic acid acidosis. it is hypothesized that factors such as increased gut permeability, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and inflammatory responses may have a role in the  etiology of sara. however, little is known about the nature of the rumen microbiome during sara. in this study, we analyzed the microbiome of 64 rumen samples taken from eight lactating holstein dairy cattle using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (trflp) of 16s rrna genes and real-time pcr. we used rumen samples from two published experiments in which sara had been  induced with either grain or alfalfa pellets. the results of trflp analysis indicated that the most predominant shift during sara was a decline in gram-negative bacteroidetes organisms. however, the proportion of bacteroidetes organisms was greater in alfalfa pellet-induced sara than in mild or severe grain-induced sara (35.4% versus 26.0% and 16.6%, respectively). this shift was also evident from the real-time pcr data for prevotella albensis, prevotella brevis, and prevotella ruminicola, which are members of the bacteroidetes. the real-time pcr data also indicated that severe grain-induced sara was dominated by streptococcus bovis and escherichia coli, whereas mild grain-induced sara was dominated by megasphaera elsdenii and alfalfa pellet-induced sara was dominated by p. albensis. using discriminant analysis, the severity of sara and degree of inflammation were highly correlated with the abundance of e. coli and not with lipopolysaccharide in the rumen. we thus suspect that e. coli may be a contributing factor in disease onset.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

AB  == in more than 30% of milk samples from clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis, bacteria fail to grow even after 48 h of conventional culture. the "no-growth" samples are problematic for mastitis laboratories, veterinarians, and dairy producers. this study provides the first investigation of the bacteriological etiology of such samples, using a real-time pcr-based commercial reagent kit. the assay targets the dna of the 11 most common bacterial species or groups in mastitis and the staphylococcal blaz gene (responsible for penicillin resistance) and can identify and quantify bacterial cells even if dead or growth-inhibited. a study was made of 79 mastitic milk samples with no-growth bacteria in conventional culture, originating from cows with clinical mastitis. of the 79 samples, 34 (43%) were positive for 1 (32 samples) or 2 (2 samples) of the target bacteria. the positive findings included 11 staphylococcus spp. (staphylococci other than staphylococcus aureus), 10 streptococcus uberis, 2 streptococcus dysgalactiae, 6 corynebacterium bovis, 3 staph. aureus, 1 escherichia coli, 1 enterococcus, and 1 arcanobacterium pyogenes. the positive samples contained as many as 10(3) to 10(7) bacterial genome copies per milliliter of milk. this study demonstrates that in nearly half of the clinical mastitis cases in which conventional culture failed to detect bacteria, mastitis pathogens were still present, often in substantial quantities. the clearly elevated n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity values of the milk samples, together with clinical signs of the infected cows and quarters, confirmed the diagnosis of clinical mastitis and indicated that real-time, pcr-based bacterial findings are  able to reveal bacteriological etiology. we conclude that all common mastitis bacteria can occur in large quantities in clinical mastitis samples that exhibit  no growth in conventional culture, and that the real-time pcr assay is a useful tool for bacteriological diagnosis of such milk samples. low bacterial concentration is commonly speculated to explain the no-growth milk samples. this  hypothesis is not supported by the results of the current study.

TI  == the clinical importance of microbiological findings in the diagnosis and management of bloodstream infections.
AB  == bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality. accurate identification of blood isolates to the species level and identification of the source of infection and/or the portal of entry are crucial for optimal management of these infections. these investigations-in addition to clinical findings and laboratory and imaging studies-are central to informing and directing efficient and effective diagnostic examinations and to choosing the optimal antimicrobial regimen. four case studies that demonstrate the importance of identifying the causative agents and the source of infection are discussed to illustrate the central importance of microbiological findings in the diagnosis of bacteremia and bloodstream infections associated with infections at other sites.

TI  == bronchoalveolar lavage cytology from captive badgers.
AB  == background: bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid is evaluated for the diagnosis and study of lung disease and airway inflammation. cytologic profiles for bal fluid have not been reported for badgers and may be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases such as mycobacterium bovis. objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate cytologic and microbial findings in bal fluid from captive european badgers (meles meles) and identify correlates with the results of concurrently collected blood and fecal samples. methods: bal fluid (by a nonbronchoscopic method) and jugular venous blood samples (for routine cbc) were obtained from 23 captive tuberculosis-free anesthetized badgers on 2 occasions 4 weeks apart. fecal samples were collected for routine parasitology. morphologic evaluation and 100-cell differentials were done on cytocentrifuged bal specimens. pellets from centrifuged bal were aerobically cultured for bacteria. results: with the 2 bal samples from each of the 23 badgers combined, the median (range) cell percentages were 73.0% (5-95%) neutrophils, 7.5% (2-16%)  macrophages, 8.0% (0-27%) lymphocytes, and 9.5% (0-92%) eosinophils. macrophages  frequently contained silica-like crystals. other findings included ciliated epithelial cells, goblet cells, mucus, and aelurostrongylus sp. larvae. a light growth of streptococcus, pasteurella, or escherichia coli was cultured in 6 badgers. trypanosoma pestanai were identified in blood from 10 badgers and fecal  parasites (mainly coccidia) were found in 20 badgers. no correlation was found between bal and cbc results and the presence of parasites. conclusions: the predominance of neutrophils in bal fluid from badgers differs from the predominance of macrophages found in bal from other species. this difference may  reflect the burrowing lifestyle or the unique immune response of badgers.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (mdr) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  == antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (mdr) strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans. atcc strains of streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus bovis, pseudimonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans were also tested. the strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. the mdr strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of acacia nilotica,  syzygium aromaticum and cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of terminalia arjuna and eucalyptus globulus. community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. the most potent antimicrobial plant was a. nilotica (mic range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher mic values than a. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. this study concludes  that a. nilotica, c. zeylanicum and s. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.

TI  == secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor: a secreted pattern recognition receptor for mycobacteria.
AB  == rationale: human secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi) displays bactericidal activity against pathogens such as escherichia coli and streptococcus. furthermore, it has been reported that murine slpi shows potent antimycobacterial activity. objectives: the aim of the present study was to investigate whether human recombinant slpi not only kills mycobacteria but also acts as a pattern recognition receptor for the host immune system. methods: for the in vivo experiment, balb/c mice were infected by intranasal instillation with mycobacterium bovis bcg and viable bcg load in lung homogenates was later determined. for the in vitro experiments, slpi was incubated overnight with a suspension of m. bovis bcg or the virulent strain mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv, and the percentage survival as well as the binding of slpi to mycobacteria was determined. furthermore, bacteria phagocytosis was also determined by flow cytometry. measurements and main results: intranasal slpi treatment decreased the number of colony-forming units recovered from lung homogenates, indicating that slpi interfered with m. bovis bcg infection. moreover, slpi decreased the viability of both m. bovis bcg and h37rv. we demonstrated that slpi attached to the surface of the mycobacteria by binding to pathogen-associated molecular pattern mannan-capped lipoarabinomannans and phosphatidylinositol mannoside. furthermore, we found that in the sputum of patients with tuberculosis, mycobacteria were coated with endogenous slpi. finally, we showed that phagocytosis of slpi-coated mycobacteria was faster than that of uncoated bacteria. conclusions: the present results demonstrate for the first time that human slpi kills mycobacteria and is a new pattern recognition receptor for them.

TI  == direct production of cadaverine from soluble starch using corynebacterium glutamicum coexpressing alpha-amylase and lysine decarboxylase.
AB  == here, we demonstrated the one-step production of cadaverine from starch using a corynebacterium glutamicum strain coexpressing streptococcus bovis 148 alpha-amylase (amya) and escherichia coli k-12 lysine decarboxylase (cada). we constructed the e. coli-c. glutamicum shuttle vector, which produces cada under the control of the high constitutive expression (hce) promoter, and transformed this vector into c. glutamicum css secreting amya. the engineered c. glutamicum expressed both cada and amya, which retained their activity. we performed cadaverine fermentation using 50 g/l soluble starch as the sole carbon source without pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, which is the coenzyme for cada. c. glutamicum coexpressing amya and cada successfully produced cadaverine from soluble starch and the yield of cadaverine was 23.4 mm after 21 h. cada expression levels under  the control of the hce promoter were assumed to be sufficient to convert l-lysine to cadaverine, as there was no accumulation of l-lysine in the culture medium during fermentation. thus, we demonstrated that c. glutamicum has great potential to produce cadaverine from biomass resources.

TI  == new strategy for enhancement of microbial viability in simulated gastric conditions based on display of starch-binding domain on cell surface.
AB  == the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis  il1403 fused to the linker region and the starch-binding domain (sbd) of the *-amylase of streptococcus bovis 148 was produced intracellularly in escherichia  coli. the fusion protein (cph-sbd) was able to bind to the cell surface of lactobacillus casei nrrl b-441 and to corn starch. therefore, adhesion of cells to corn starch was mediated by the fusion protein. at a cell density of 10(9) cfu/ml and a starch concentration of 5 mg/ml, cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells aggregated with corn starch, whereas the free cells of l. casei did not form any  aggregates with corn starch. after incubation in simulated gastric juice (ph 3.0, 1 h), the survival percentages of free cells, amylose-coated free cells, and free cells mixed with corn starch were 0.074%, 7.2%, and 3.1% respectively. when cph-sbd-displaying bacteria aggregated with corn starch, their survival percentage was 8% higher than that of free cells mixed with corn starch. the survival of the amylose-coated cph-sbd-displaying l. casei cells was comparable to that of amylose-coated free cells, whereas the survival percentage of amylose-coated aggregates of cph-sbd-displaying bacteria with corn starch was 28% higher than that of amylose-coated mixture of free cells with corn starch. these  results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the cell-surface display technique for enhancement of the delivery of viable microorganisms to the intestinal tract.

TI  == bidirectional cell-surface anchoring function of c-terminal repeat region of peptidoglycan hydrolase of lactococcus lactis il1403.
AB  == with the aim of constructing an efficient protein display system for lactic acid  bacteria (labs), the effect of fusion direction on the cell-surface binding activity of the c-terminal region of the peptidoglycan hydrolase (cph) of lactococcus lactis il1403 was studied. cph fused to the alpha-amylase (amy) of streptococcus bovis 148 either at its c-terminus (cph-amy) or at its n-terminus (amy-cph) was expressed intracellularly in escherichia coli. this domain was able to direct binding of amy to the surface of l. lactis atcc 19435 in both constructs. however, the number of bound molecules per cell and the specific activity for starch digestion in the case of cph-amy were 3 and 14 times greater  than those in the case of amy-cph, respectively. of the labs tested, l. lactis atcc 19435 showed the highest binding capability for cph-amy, up to 6 x 10(4) molecules per cell, with a dissociation rate constant of 5.00 x 10(-5) s(-1). the binding of cph-amy to the surface of lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc 9649 cells was very stable with a dissociation rate constant of 6.96 x 10(-6) s(-1). the production of cph-amy in the soluble form increased 3-fold as a result of coexpression with a molecular chaperone, trigger factor. the results of this study suggest the usefulness of cph as a bidirectional anchor protein for the production of cell-surface adhesive enzymes in e. coli. furthermore, the importance of the fusion direction of cph in determining cell-surface binding and enzymatic activities was shown.

TI  == the energy spilling reactions of bacteria and other organisms.
AB  == for many years it was assumed that living organisms always utilized atp in a highly efficient manner, but simple growth studies with bacteria indicated that the efficiency of biomass production was often at least 3-fold lower than the amount that would be predicted from standard biosynthetic pathways. the utilization of energy for maintenance could only explain a small portion of this  discrepancy particularly when the growth rate was high. these ideas and thermodynamic arguments indicated that cells might have another avenue of energy  utilization. this phenomenon has also been called 'uncoupling', 'spillage' and 'overflow metabolism', but 'energy spilling' is probably the most descriptive term. it appears that many bacteria spill energy, and the few that do not can be  killed (large and often rapid decrease in viability), if the growth medium is nitrogen-limited and the energy source is in 'excess'. the lactic acid bacterium, streptococcus bovis, is an ideal bacterium for the study of energy spilling. because it only uses substrate level phosphorylation to generate atp, atp generation can be calculated with a high degree of certainty. it does not store glucose as glycogen, and its cell membrane can be easily accessed. comparative analysis of heat production, membrane voltage, atp production and ohm's law indicated that the energy spilling reaction of s. bovis is mediated by a futile cycle of protons through the cell membrane. less is known about escherichia coli, but in this bacterium energy spilling could be mediated by a futile cycle of potassium or ammonium ions. energy spilling is not restricted to prokaryotes and  appears to occur in yeasts and in higher organisms. in man, energy spilling may be related to cancer, ageing, ischemia and cardiac failure.

TI  == repeated meningitis as a delayed complication of scoliosis surgery.
AB  == study design: case report. objective: to report a case of very delayed repeated meningitis after surgical treatment of scoliosis. summary of background data: delayed infection after spine surgery is a well-reported phenomenon, presenting usually with local wound symptoms and back pain. the occurrence of meningitis after spinal instrumentation is reported but not common. delayed repeated episodes of meningitis after surgical treatment of scoliosis have never been reported. case report: we report a case of a 44-year-old gentleman, submitted to  surgical treatment of scoliosis years ago, who presented with repeated episodes of meningitis due to the formation of an abnormal communication between an infected cyst in the bone cavity where the rods were located and the intradural space in the lumbar spine. computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of a bone cyst with thickened layering, and surgical exploration revealed the communication between this cystic cavity and the intradural space. after surgical closure of the dural space and cleaning of the cyst, the patient responded well to antibiotic therapy and was free of new episodes of meningitis up to the last follow-up, 1 year after the surgical treatment. clinical diagnosis of delayed postoperative infection in spine surgery may be difficult if no wound signs are present. clinical symptoms vary and may include increased back pain, wound redness, swelling and drainage, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and white blood count, fever, and malaise. conclusions: delayed meningitis can be a late complication of spinal instrumentation for scoliosis. a high index of suspicion is necessary.

TI  == potential pathogens carried by spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) in southern spain.
AB  == the spanish ibex (capra pyrenaica hispanica) population of southern spain was surveyed for potential pathogens associated with the conjunctiva, external ear canal, as well as reproductive and upper respiratory tracts. we sampled 321 ibex  (131 adult males, 100 adult females, and 90 yearlings); these included 271 apparently healthy animals and 50 that were naturally infected with sarcoptes scabiei. a total of 688 bacterial isolates were identified (377 gram-negatives, 225 gram-positives, and 86 mycoplasma spp.); sex, age, location, infection with s. scabiei, and disposition of the animal (free-ranging versus captive) were evaluated as risk factors for infection. infections with mycoplasma agalactiae and mycoplasma arginini were associated with age, having a higher frequency of isolation in young animals. with escherichia coli, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida biotype a, and staphylococcus aureus, significantly higher  isolation rates were associated with adults. the isolation frequency for e. coli  was higher in females, whereas moraxella bovis isolations were mostly associated  with males. the presence of mange increased the risk of infection with both streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and m. haemolytica. the geographic origin of sampled animals was related to the isolation of branhamella ovis, m. agalactiae, and all pasteurella sp. isolations of m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, e. coli, and b. ovis were more prevalent in samples from free-ranging  rather than captive animals. of the gram-positive bacteria, s. aureus represented the predominant species isolated from nasal, vaginal, and ocular samples. mycoplasma agalactiae and m. arginini were the predominant mycoplasma spp., and both were associated most often with the external ear canal. the most frequently  isolated gram-negative bacteria included e. coli, m. haemolytica, p. multocida biotype a, and b. ovis. isolation rates of gram-negative species varied by source. in nasal samples, m. haemolytica and p. multocida biotype a were isolated most frequently, whereas in ocular and vaginal samples, b. ovis and e. coli, respectively, were most frequently isolated.

TI  == profiling the humoral immune response in colon cancer patients: diagnostic antigens from streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the human bowel contains a large and dynamic bacterial population that is not only essential for intestinal health, but also critical for the development of diseases such as cancer. in this respect, the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus bovis has been associated with colon cancer for many years. to investigate the clinical importance of this association, an immunocapture mass spectrometry assay was developed that can generate infection-related protein profiles. the composition of these profiles is governed by the capture of specific antigens by serum antibodies from colon cancer patients. this assay showed that s. bovis antigen profiles could distinguish 11 out of 12 colon cancer patients from 8 control subjects, whereas antigen profiles derived from the gut bacterium escherichia coli were not diagnostic for colon cancer. moreover, s. bovis antigen profiles were also detected in polyp patients, indicating that infection with this bacterium does occur early during carcinogenesis. highly accurate tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify one of the diagnostic antigens as a surface-exposed heparin-binding protein, which might be involved in attachment of s. bovis to tumor cells. together, these findings corroborate the hypothesis that colonic lesions provide a specific niche for s. bovis, resulting  in tumor-associated "silent" infections. these infections, however, only become apparent in colon cancer patients with a compromised immune system (bacteremia) or coincidental cardiac valve lesions (endocarditis). this makes profiling of the humoral immune response against "silent" s. bovis infections a promising diagnostic tool for the early detection of human colon cancer, which is crucial for the effective treatment of this disease.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == display of active enzymes on the cell surface of escherichia coli using pgsa anchor protein and their application to bioconversion.
AB  == we have developed a novel escherichia coli cell surface display system by employing pgsa as an anchoring motif. in our display system, c-terminal fusion to pgsa anchor protein from bacillus subtilis was used. the enzymes selected for display were alpha-amylase (amya) from streptococcus bovis 148 and lipase b (calb) from candida antarctica. the molecular mass values of amya and calb are approximately 77 and 34 kda, respectively. the enzymes were displayed on the surface as a fusion protein with a flag peptide tag at the c terminus. both the pgsa-amya-flag and pgsa-calb-flag fusion proteins were shown to be displayed by immunofluorescence labeling using anti-flag antibody. the displayed enzymes were  active forms, and amya and calb activities reached 990 u/g (dry cell weight) and  4.6 u/g (dry cell weight), respectively. amya-displaying e. coli cells grew utilizing cornstarch as the sole carbon source, while calb-displaying e. coli cells catalyzed enantioselective transesterification, indicating that they are effective whole-cell biocatalysts. since a target enzyme with a size of 77 kda and an industrially useful lipase have been successfully displayed on the cell surface of e. coli for the first time, pgsa protein is probably a useful anchoring motif to display various enzymes.

TI  == gross abnormalities, bacteriology and histological lesions of uteri of dairy cows failing to conceive or maintain pregnancy.
AB  == aim: to describe the gross pathology, bacteriology and histopathology of the reproductive tracts of dairy cows that failed to conceive or maintain pregnancy.  methods: the reproductive tracts of 105 cows that were not pregnant at the end of the seasonal breeding programme were retrieved following slaughter. the tracts were examined grossly, both horns of the uterine lumen were swabbed for bacteriology, and tissue was collected from each horn and the body of the uterus  for histopathology. grossly enlarged uteri and tracts containing purulent vaginal content were excluded. histopathology was performed on three sections of uterine  tissue from each of three cows in which no gross pathological changes were detected and from which no bacteria were isolated, from three cows in which no gross pathology was detected but from which bacteria were isolated, and from three cows in which gross pathological changes were detected but from which no bacteria were isolated. results: thirty-six (34%) cows had one or more gross lesions which involved the ovary, uterine tube, uterus or vagina. bacteria were isolated from the uteri of 22 (21%) cows. isolates included arcanobacterium pyogenes (n = 1), escherichia coli (n = 1), fusobacterium spp (n = 1), haemophilus somnus (n = 5), streptococcus acidominimus (n = 12), s. bovis (n = 2), s. uberis (n = 1) and s. salivarious (n = 1). in only five cows were both gross pathology and bacteria detected. there was no relationship between the isolation of bacteria and the diagnosis of gross pathology of the uterus. there were no differences in the degree of histopathological changes in the uteri from  the three groups of cows examined, and lesions present were minor. conclusions: gross pathological changes and intra-uterine bacteria were found in 34% and 20% of cows, respectively, but the correlation between the two was poor. histopathological changes were unremarkable, suggesting the bacteriological findings were coincidental, that causative agents of infertility were not present at the time of examination, or that unrelated causes such as nutritional anoestrus may have been responsible for the failure of some cows to conceive.

TI  == improved survival in experimental sepsis with an orally administered inhibitor of apoptosis.
AB  == the pathophysiology of sepsis involves excessive lymphocyte apoptosis, which correlates with adverse outcomes, and disordered cytokine production, which may promote host injury. as the protease inhibitor (pi) class of antiretroviral agents is known to prevent apoptosis in vitro, we evaluated their effect on survival, lymphocyte apoptosis, and consequent cytokine production in mice with sepsis induced by cecal ligation and perforation. mice pretreated with pis have improved survival (67%; p<0.0005) compared with controls (17%) and a significant  (p<0.05) reduction in lymphocyte apoptosis. even mice receiving therapy beginning 4 h after perforation demonstrated improved survival (50%; p<0.05) compared with  controls. pi therapy is also associated with an increase in the th1 cytokine tnf-alpha (p<0.05) early in sepsis and a reduction in the th2 cytokines il-6 and  il-10 (p<0.05) late in sepsis; despite no intrinsic antibacterial effects, pi also reduced quantitative bacterial blood cultures. the beneficial effects of pi  appear to be specific to lymphocyte apoptosis, as lymphocyte-deficient rag1-/- mice did not experience benefit from treatment with pi. thus, inhibition of lymphocyte apoptosis by pi is a candidate approach for the treatment of sepsis.

TI  == resistance of rumen bacteria murein to bovine gastric lysozyme.
AB  == background: lysozymes, enzymes mostly associated with defence against bacterial infections, are mureinolytic. ruminants have evolved a gastric c type lysozyme as a digestive enzyme, and profit from digestion of foregut bacteria, after most dietary components, including protein, have been fermented in the rumen. in this  work we characterized the biological activities of bovine gastric secretions against membranes, purified murein and bacteria. results: bovine gastric extract  (bge) was active against both g+ and g- bacteria, but the effect against gram- bacteria was not due to the lysozyme, since purified bgl had only activity against gram+ bacteria. we were unable to find small pore forming peptides in the bge, and found that the inhibition of gram negative bacteria by bge was due to an artefact caused by acetate. we report for first time the activity of bovine gastric lysozyme (bg lysozyme) against pure bacterial cultures, and the specific  resistance of some rumen gram positive strains to bgl. conclusions: some gram+ rumen bacteria showed resistance to abomasum lysozyme. we discuss the implications of this finding in the light of possible practical applications of such a stable antimicrobial peptide.

AB  == otitis externa in cattle has a significant impact in tropical and subtropical regions, and the aetiological agents are predominantly rhabditiform nematodes and mites of the genus raillietia. its prevalence is higher in mature and zebu cattle. in advanced clinical cases there can be irreversible and fatal neural lesions. ear infection in calves has been associated with concurrent respiratory  diseases and mixed infection. the principal reported agents of otitis in calves are bacteria such as actinomyces spp., corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, escherichia coli, haemophilus somnus, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas spp., streptococcus spp. and mycoplasma bovis. the control and treatment of bovine otitis is not standardized and there is little evidence-based support for the diverse treatments available in the literature.

TI  == molecular characteristics and transcription of the gene encoding a multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenase in relation to the deactivation of pyruvate formate-lyase in the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis.
AB  == to clarify the deactivation mechanism of pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) and its role in the regulation of fermentation in streptococcus bovis, the molecular properties and genetic expression of multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenase (adhe) were investigated. s. bovis was found to have adhe, which was deduced to consist  of 872 amino acids with a molecular mass of 97.4 kda. the adhe was shown to harbor three enzyme activities: (1) alcohol dehydrogenase, (2) coenzyme-a-linked  acetaldehyde dehydrogenase that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-coa to ethanol, and (3) pfl deactivase. similar to escherichia coli adhe, s. bovis adhe  required fe2+ for its activity. the gene encoding adhe ( adhe) was shown to be monocistronic. the level of adhe mrna changed in parallel with the mrna levels of the genes encoding pfl (pfl) and pfl-activating enzyme (act) as the growth conditions changed, although these genes are independently transcribed. synthesis of adhe, pfl-activating enzyme, and pfl appears to be regulated concomitantly. overexpression of adhe did not cause a change in the formate-to-lactate ratio. it is conceivable that adhe is not significantly involved in the reversible inactivation of active pfl under anoxic conditions. partition of the flow from pyruvate appears to be mainly regulated by the activities of lactate dehydrogenase and pfl.

TI  == adrenomedullin expression by gastric epithelial cells in response to infection.
AB  == many surface epithelial cells express adrenomedullin, a multifunctional peptide found in a wide number of body and cell systems. recently, we and others have proposed that adrenomedullin has an important novel role in host defense. this peptide has many properties in common with other cationic antimicrobial peptides, including the human beta-defensins. upon exposure of human gastric epithelial cells to viable cells of invasive or noninvasive strains of helicobacter pylori,  escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, or streptococcus bovis, a significant increase in adrenomedullin secretion from these cells was demonstrated. adrenomedullin gene expression was also increased in response to these microorganisms. similar observations were noted when these cells were incubated with proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 alpha (il-1 alpha), il-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide. in cultured cells and an animal infection model, increased adrenomedullin peptide and gene expression was  demonstrated when exposed to e. coli or mycobacterium paratuberculosis, respectively. the data suggest there is a strong association between epithelial infection, inflammation, and adrenomedullin expression, which may have clinical relevance. the regulation of adrenomedullin expression may have therapeutic applications, such as improving or enhancing mucosal immunity.

TI  == diet influences the ecology of lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli along the digestive tract of cattle: neural networks and 16s rdna.
AB  == in this manuscript, the authors have sought to gain a better understanding of the interactions between escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from rogossa mrs agar along the digestive tract of grain- and forage-fed cattle.  e. coli from cattle receiving a high-grain diet were more numerous (p<0.05) than  from the high-forage diet and the highest numbers were in the faeces. isolates on rogossa mrs agar were always greater in the high-grain diet (p<0.05) and contained a significant number of lab. a random set of rogossa mrs agar colonies  was selected and artificial neural networks were used to develop a relationship between colony description and species which was validated using sequence analysis (16s rdna). the neural networks correctly predicted species in more than 80 % of cases and was composed, primarily, of lactobacillus vitulinus, lactobacillus ruminis, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, acidaminococcus fermentans and megasphaera elsdenii. in conjunction with statistical diversity indices, it was demonstrated that diversity in the high-fibre diet was always lower and was a consequence of the dominance of str. bovis. in contrast, the diversity in the high-grain diet was greater (p<0.05) and was a consequence of the decline in str. bovis. these data demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between coliform and lab isolates throughout the digestive tract of cattle, and diet is the major factor regulating bacterial composition.

TI  == effects of pneumoperitoneum on hemodynamic and systemic immunologic responses to  peritonitis in pigs.
AB  == background: experimental evidence supporting the safety of laparoscopic intervention during sepsis is limited. the purpose of this study was to evaluate  the effects of pneumoperitoneum on immunologic and hemodynamic responses to peritoneal sepsis. materials and methods: a porcine model of peritonitis was created using an intraperitoneal autologous fecal inoculum. pigs were then subjected to one of four procedures 24 h postinoculation (n = 6 per group): laparotomy, co(2) laparoscopy, helium laparoscopy, and anesthesia only (1.5% isoflurane in 100% o(2), mechanical ventilation). venous blood samples were obtained prior to inoculation, and at 24 (prior to procedure), 30, 48, 72, and 96 h postinoculation to determine white blood count (wbc) with differential, c-reactive protein (crp), tumor necrosis factor, and bacteremia. heart rate, end-tidal co(2) (etco(2)), mean arterial blood pressure (map), and arterial blood gas variables were also measured at baseline and every 30 min throughout the procedure. results: postoperative blood cultures confirmed systemic bacteremia in all groups at all time periods postinoculation. following inoculation, wbc, band  cell count, and crp remained elevated above baseline in all groups throughout the study (p < 0.01). however, no significant differences in these parameters were observed among groups. in the co(2) laparoscopy group, map, etco(2), and arterial pco(2) were increased above baseline, while ph was decreased throughout the procedure (p < 0.01). conclusions: in this animal model of peritonitis, co(2) pneumoperitoneum induced hypercapnia, acidemia, and systemic hypertension intraoperatively, without a discernable effect on systemic immune function.

TI  == molecular characterization and expression of pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme in a ruminal bacterium, streptococcus bovis.
AB  == to clarify the significance of the activation of pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) by  pfl-activating enzyme (pfl-ae) in streptococcus bovis, the molecular properties and gene expression of pfl-ae were investigated. s. bovis pfl-ae was deduced to consist of 261 amino acids with a molecular mass of 29.9 kda and appeared to be a monomer protein. similar to escherichia coli pfl-ae, s. bovis pfl-ae required fe(2+) for activity. the gene encoding pfl-ae (act) was found to be polycistronic, and the pfl gene (pfl) was not included. however, the act mrna level changed in parallel with the pfl mrna level, responding to growth conditions, and the change was contrary to the change in the lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) mrna level. pfl-ae synthesis appeared to change in parallel with pfl synthesis. introduction of a recombinant plasmid containing s. bovis pfl and the pfl promoter into s. bovis did not affect formate and lactate production, which suggests that the activity of the pfl promoter is low. when the pfl promoter was replaced by the s. bovis ldh promoter, pfl was overexpressed, which  caused an increase in the formate-to-lactate ratio. however, when pfl-ae was overexpressed, the formate-to-lactate ratio did not change, suggesting that pfl-ae was present at a level that was high enough to activate pfl. when both pfl-ae and pfl were overexpressed, the formate-to-lactate ratio further increased. it is conceivable that ldh activity is much higher than pfl activity,  which may explain why the formate-to-lactate ratio is usually low.

TI  == development and application of quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay based on the abi 7700 system (taqman) for detection and quantification of mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.
AB  == numerous reports have described diagnostic methods based on the polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) used to detect mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, the causative agent of johne's disease. the result of conventional pcr tests has been only qualitative, either positive or negative; it does not present any quantitative information about the number of the agents in the specimen. a quantitative pcr method (is900 taqman) was developed to measure the number of m.  a. paratuberculosis organisms present in field and clinical samples. the sensitivity of is900 taqman was 1 colony-forming unit (cfu) for m. a. paratuberculosis atcc 19698. the specificity of the method was determined by testing 14 mycobacterial species (m. abscessus, m. asiaticum, m. avium subsp. avium, m. bovis, m. fortuitum subsp. fortuitum, m. intracellulare, m. kansasii, m. marinum, m. phlei, m. scrofulaceum, m. simiae, m. smegmatis, m. terrae, and m. ulcerans) and 9 nonmycobacterial species (borrelia burgdorferi, chlamydia psittaci, ehrlichia canis, e. equi, e. risticii, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, streptococcus equi, and s. zooepidemicus). even at high cell numbers (10(5) cfu/reaction), most of the organisms tested negative for the is900 insertion element except m. marinum and m. scrofulaceum. this finding for m. scrofulaceum was consistent with previous reports that several m. scrofulaceum-like isolates were positive for is900. those isolates had 71-79% homology with m. a. paratuberculosis in the region of is900. when used in conjunction with the new liquid medium-based esp culture system ii for bovine clinical fecal samples, is900 taqman confirmed that the esp ii-positive samples contained 10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml of m. a. paratuberculosis. all of the 222 esp ii-positive and acid-fast bacilli-positive samples tested in this study were positive by is900 taqman. is900 taqman was also useful in the study of growth characteristics of 3 groups of m. a. paratuberculosis strains in bovine fecal samples from 3 shedding levels (heavy, medium, and low) based on cell numbers measured by herrold egg yolk (hey) agar culture. when cultured in esp medium, m.  a. paratuberculosis reached 10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml within 2 weeks for heavy shedders, 3-4 weeks for medium, and 6-8 weeks for low shedders. no significant growth was observed after up to 5 weeks of incubation for some of low shedders. no or extremely slow growth characteristic of low shedders might be a possible explanation for frequent false-negative results by hey. the detection time was dependent on the inoculum size and the growth rate of m. a. paratuberculosis. generation times were inversely proportional to the shedding level: 1-2 days for  medium and heavy shedders and >4 days for low shedders. is900 taqman could be a useful tool for determining viable cell counts by measuring changes in cell numbers over the incubation period.

TI  == recombinant escherichia coli engineered for production of l-lactic acid from hexose and pentose sugars.
AB  == recombinant escherichia coli have been constructed for the conversion of glucose  as well as pentose sugars into l-lactic acid. the strains carry the lactate dehydrogenase gene from streptococcus bovis on a low copy number plasmid for production of l-lactate. three e. coli strains were transformed with the plasmid  for producing l-lactic acid. strains fbr9 and fbr11 were serially transferred 10  times in anaerobic cultures in sugar-limited medium containing glucose or xylose  without selective antibiotic. an average of 96% of both fbr9 and fbr11 cells maintained pvaldh1 in anaerobic cultures. the fermentation performances of fbr9,  fbr10, and fbr11 were compared in ph-controlled batch fermentations with medium containing 10% w/v glucose. fermentation results were superior for fbr11, an e. coli b strain, compared to those observed for fbr9 or fbr10. fbr11 exhausted the  glucose within 30 h, and the maximum lactic acid concentration (7.32% w/v) was 93% of the theoretical maximum. the other side-products detected were cell mass and succinic acid (0.5 g/l).

TI  == characterization of the cryptic plasmid psbo2 isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1 and construction of a new shuttle vector.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid designated psbo2 (3582 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. the psbo2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (cop), countertranscribed rnas (ctrnas),  and a replication protein (rep), which were similar to those from pmv158 and pls1, which were isolated from s. agalactiae, and pwvo1, isolated from lactococcus lactis. the putative single-strand origin (sso) of psbo2 was similar  to per341 and pst1, which were isolated from s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmid designated psbe2 was constructed to bind pecm184 vector and the dna fragment containing sso, dso, cop, ctrnas, and rep of psbo2. when psbe2 was introduced into s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. this plasmid, designated psbe2a, was capable of transforming escherichia coli and s. bovis strains 12-u-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, psbe2a is an effective shuttle vector.

TI  == significance of fecal volatile fatty acids in shedding of escherichia coli o157 from calves: experimental infection and preliminary use of a probiotic product.
AB  == cattle have been recognized as a principal reservoir of escherichia coli o157:h7. this organism appears to be confined to the gastrointestinal tract and is shed in feces. a probiotic product containing lactic acid-producing streptococcus bovis lcb6 and lactobacillus gallinarum lcb 12 isolated from adult cattle was developed, and a preliminary experiment was conducted to evaluate its effect on the elimination of e. coli o157 from experimentally infected calves. eight 4-month-old holstein calves were orally challenged with e. coli o157 and the probiotic product was administered against four calves continued fecal shedding of e. coli o157 by the 7th day after infection. fecal shedding of e. coli o157 was completely inhibited and re-shedding was not detected in any of the animals.  remarkable increase of vfas, especially that of acetic acid in feces after the administration of probiotic bacteria correlated with the diminution of e. coli o157. four calves that had spontaneously ceased fecal shedding of e. coli o157 by the 7th day exhibited a high concentration of vfas in feces before and after experimental infection. although our results are preliminary and obtained from calves under limited conditions, the possible application of probiotic product to reduce fecal shedding of e. coli o157 from cattle is suggested.

TI  == effects of ph and energy supply on activity and amount of pyruvate formate-lyase  in streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the enzyme system of pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) in streptococcus bovis was investigated by isolating pfl and pfl-activating enzyme (pfl-ae) from s. bovis, flavodoxin from escherichia coli, and chloroplasts from spinach. in this study, the pfl and pfl-ae in s. bovis were found to be similar to those in e. coli, suggesting that the activating mechanisms are similar. the optimal ph of s. bovis pfl was 7.5, which is in contrast to the optimal ph of s. bovis lactate dehydrogenase, which is 5.5. the apparent k(m) of s. bovis pfl was 2 mm. the intermediates of glycolysis, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (dhap) and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (gap), were shown to inhibit pfl activity. the concentrations of intracellular dhap and gap in s. bovis ranged from 1.9 mm to less than 0.1 mm and from 0.6 mm to less than 0.05 mm, respectively, depending on the energy supply. the wide variations in dhap and gap levels indicated that pfl  activity is allosterically regulated by these triose phosphates in vivo. the amount of pfl protein, as determined by western blot analysis with polyclonal antibody, changed in parallel with the level of pfl-mrna, responding to the culture conditions. these observations confirm that pfl synthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level and support the hypothesis that s. bovis shifts the fermentation pathway from acetate, formate, and ethanol production to lactate production when the ph is low and when excess energy is supplied.

AB  == the lactoferrin (lf) concentration in the milk from dairy cows with clinical mastitis was determined to evaluate the relationship between the lf concentration (lfc) in milk and the non-specific defensive capability of the udder. the mean lfc in 368 milk samples from 319 cows with clinical mastitis was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that of normal cows. the mean lfc in milk from quarters infected with mycoplasma bovis or staphylococcus aureus was significantly higher  (p < 0.05) than that of quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns). in escherichia coli mastitis, the level of lfc in milk from cows with peracute mastitis was significantly lower (p < 0.01) than that from cows with acute mastitis. in cases of mastitis due to e. coli, the mean lfc in milk from cows that needed more than 10 days to recover from the mastitis or were not cured was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that for cows which took less than 10 days to be cured. the mean lfc in milk from cows with peracute e. coli mastitis was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that for cows with mastitis associated with environmental streptococci or cns, although these low lf levels were somewhat increased after 46 h from the occurrence of mastitis. these results suggest that the decreased levels of lf in peracute e. coli mastitis may be associated with the progress of inflammation in the early phase of mastitis.

TI  == structure and transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding pyruvate formate-lyase of a ruminal bacterium, streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the gene (pfl) encoding pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) from streptococcus bovis was sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequence of pfl was similar to streptococcus mutans pfl, and included the conserved regions necessary for free-radical formation and a catalytic site. the pfl of s. bovis appeared to be a free-radical-containing enzyme because of its dioxygen sensitivity and its amino  acid sequence similarity with the escherichia coli enzyme. the pfl mrna of s. bovis was approximately 2.3 kb and was transcribed in a monocistronic fashion. when cells were grown in batch culture at ph 6.9, the level of pfl transcript increased as the growth phase changed from exponential growth to stationary phase. this result was in constrast to the previous observation that the level of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) mrna decreased during the later stages of growth. continuous culture experiments conducted at ph 6.9 under glucose-limited and ammonia-limited conditions revealed that pfl mrna was decreased by an excess supply of glucose, as well as by a high growth rate. on the contrary, ldh mrna increased when excess glucose was supplied and the growth rate was high. the amount of pfl mrna in cells was lower at ph 4.5 than ph 6.9, whereas the level of ldh mrna was higher at ph 4.5. this result was consistent with the amounts of pfl and ldh in cells and the proportion of formate and lactate produced. these results support the hypothesis that s. bovis regulates pfl and ldh synthesis at the transcriptional level in response to growth conditions.

TI  == phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  == the 16s rrna sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable  and condensed tannins. bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including sardinian sheep (ovis aries), honduran and colombian goats (capra hircus), white-tail deer (odocoileus  virginianus) from upstate new york, and rocky mountain elk (cervus elaphus nelsoni) from oregon. nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rrna genes,  which were obtained by pcr amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for  phylogenetic characterization. comparisons of the 16s rrna of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism streptococcus gallolyticus. one of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-g+c-content group of  gram-positive bacteria. the sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class proteobacteria. none of the 16s rrna sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism  or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in europe, north america, and south america. the presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.

AB  == the in vitro activities of seven quinolones and the sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdr) in the a and b subunits of dna gyrase were  determined for 14 mycobacterial species. on the basis of quinolone activity, quinolones were arranged from that with the greatest to that with the least activity as follows: sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, flumequine, and nalidixic acid. based on mics, the species could be organized into three groups: resistant (mycobacterium avium, m. intracellulare, m. marinum, m. chelonae, m. abscessus [ofloxacin mics, >/=8 microg/ml]), moderately susceptible (m. tuberculosis, m. bovis bcg, m. kansasii, m. leprae, m. fortuitum third biovariant, m. smegmatis [ofloxacin mics, 0.5 to 1 microg/ml]), and susceptible (m. fortuitum, m. peregrinum, m. aurum [ofloxacin mics, </=0.25 microg/ml]). peptide sequences of the qrdr of gyrb were identical in all the species, including the amino acids at the three positions known to be involved in acquired resistance to quinolone, i.e., 426 (asp), 447 (arg), and 464 (asn) (numbering system used for escherichia coli). the last two residues could be involved in the overall low level of susceptibility of mycobacteria to quinolones since they differ from those found in the very susceptible e. coli (lys-447 and ser-464) but are identical to those found in the less susceptible staphylococcus  aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. peptide sequences of the qrdr of gyra were identical in all the species, except for the amino acid at position 83, which was an alanine in the two less susceptible groups and a serine in the most susceptible one, as in e. coli, suggesting that this amino acid is involved in the observed differences of quinolone susceptibility within the mycobacterium genus.

AB  == streptococcus bovis expresses two different amylases, one intracellular and the other secreted. a suicide vector containing part of the intracellular alpha-amylase gene from streptococcus bovis wi-1 was recombined into the s. bovis wi-1 chromosome to disrupt the endogenous gene. recombination was demonstrated by southern blot, and zymogram analysis confirmed the loss of the intracellular amylase. amylase activity in cell-free extracts of the recombinant grown in the presence of 1% starch was only 7% of wild type. the rate of logarithmic growth of the recombinant was 15-20% of the wild type in medium containing either 1% glucose, starch, or cellobiose. revertants and non-amylase control recombinants had logarithmic growth rates that were the same as wild type. plasmid transformants containing multiple copies of the cloned gene expressed up to threefold higher levels of intracellular amylase activity than wild type but did  not demonstrate elevated growth rates. these results suggest that a critical level of expression of the intracellular amylase gene may be important for rapid  growth of the bacterium.

TI  == cloning, sequence, and expression of the l-(+) lactate dehydrogenase of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the ldh gene encoding the fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent l-(+) lactate dehydrogenase from the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis was cloned and sequenced. a genomic library of s. bovis jb1 dna was constructed in lambda zap ii and screened by use of a heterologous probe derived from the cloned streptococcus mutans ldh gene. several clones were isolated that contained a common 2.9-kb fragment as determined by restriction analysis. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 987-bp open reading frame with extensive homology to streptococcus thermophilus and s. mutans ldh nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. expression  of the cloned s. bovis ldh gene in escherichia coli was confirmed by the ability  to complement the ldh mutation of e. coli fmj39, by using an in-gel activity screen and by enzymatic assay. increased ldh activity was observed in s. bovis jb1 containing the cloned ldh genes on a multicopy plasmid.

TI  == effect of natural infection with minor pathogens on susceptibility to natural infection with major pathogens in the bovine mammary gland.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the effect of natural udder infection with minor pathogens on subsequent natural infection with major pathogens. sample population: 7 dairy  herds with low bulk milk somatic cell count. procedure: during a 20-month prospective study, milk samples were collected from diary cows at regular intervals and from quarters with clinical signs of mastitis. incidence of intramammary infection was calculated in uninfected quarters and in quarters infected with minor pathogens. a within-cow, matched case-control analysis was used to evaluate the effect of minor pathogens on subsequent infection with major pathogens. results: quarters infected with minor pathogens had higher somatic cell count than did uninfected quarters. in quarters infected with corynebacterium bovis, the rate of infection with major pathogens was lower, whereas in quarters infected with coagulase-negative micrococcaceae, the rate of  infection with major pathogens was higher than that in uninfected quarters. from  the within-cow comparison, it appeared that, in quarters infected with minor pathogens, infection with major pathogens was significantly lower than that in comparable control quarters not infected with minor pathogens. conclusions: minor pathogens have a protective effect against infection with major pathogens. the protective effect of c bovis against subsequent infection with major pathogens appears to be greater than the effect of coagulase-negative micrococcaceae.

TI  == use of fura-2/am to measure intracellular free calcium in selenomonas ruminantium.
AB  == this paper describes a procedure for loading the acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (fura-2/am), and the subsequent measurement of the concentration of intracellular free ca2+ ([ca2+]i) in selenomonas ruminantium (s. ruminantium) using this technique. to ascertain the optimal loading conditions, the effect was examined on the loading of fura-2/am of ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (edta), lysozyme, pluronic f127 alone, or the simultaneous application of edta and pluronic f127. individual administration of either edta, lysozyme or pluronic f127 did not produce an optimal loading of fura-2/ am. the co-application of pluronic f127 and bovine serum albumin after treatment with edta increased the ratio of the fluorescence due to excitation at 340 nm to that at 380 nm (r340/380) markedly, with a high signal intensity for intracellular fura-2, indicating that adequate loading had been obtained. using the present loading method, it was found that the resting free [ca2+]i of s. ruminantium was 48.1 +/- 2.2 nm (n = 6). this is approximately one half that found in escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus bovis and eucaryote cells. this is the first measurement of free [ca2+]i using fura-2/am in the gram-negative strict anaerobe s. ruminantium.

AB  == monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: pepn1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase pepn, pept1-5 against a tripeptidase pept and pepd1-3 against a dipeptidase pepd. these monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. a number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. pept1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kda protein in lactobacillus delbrueckii,  while pept1 and pept2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of streptococcus thermophilus and clostridium fervidus. of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against pepn, only pepn3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kda protein in escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against pepn3 cross reacted with 80 kda proteins of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii, and str. bovis, but not of esch. coli. of the three monoclonal antibodies against pepd, only pepd1 and pepd2 cross reacted with 40 kda proteins  of lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii and str. bovis. all pepn, pepd and pept antibodies  reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of lc. lactis subsp. cremoris wg2. however, lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other lc. lactis subspecies since only pept1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. immunogold labelling of lc. lactis wg2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that pepn, pepd and pept were located intracellularly. the intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

TI  == identification of intracellular amylase activity in streptococcus bovis and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis has been demonstrated to produce an extracellular amylase activity. we previously reported on the cloning of a gene from s. bovis encoding for what was initially believed to be the extracellular amylase. dna sequence analyses indicated that the amylase produced by the cloned  gene did not match the n-terminus amino acid sequence of the purified extracellular amylase and contained no apparent leader sequence for secretion. analyses of crude extracts demonstrated the presence of an intracellular amylase  in s. bovis jb1 that differed in molecular weight (56,000) from that of the extracellular amylase (70,000). the 56,000 molecular weight amylase was identical to the amylase produced by escherichia coli containing the cloned amylase gene. low levels of intracellular amylase activity were also detected in other strains  of s. bovis and also streptococcus salivarius. introduction of the plasmid pva838 containing the cloned amylase gene into s. bovis and s. sanguis resulted in enhanced intracellular amylase production by both organisms. the amylase gene has been sequenced, and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence for the amylase indicates a high degree of similarity with secreted amylases from bacillus species.

AB  == the alpha-amylase genes of streptococcus bovis 148 were cloned in escherichia coli mc1061, using pbr322. the recombinant plasmids were classified into two groups on the basis of their restriction maps. southern blot analysis did not show homology between the two types of alpha-amylase genes, and the two alpha-amylase genes existed on the chromosomal dna of s. bovis 148. the enzymatic properties and n-terminal amino acid sequences of the two purified enzymes produced by the cloned e. coli strains were quite different from each other. particularly, one alpha-amylase (amy i) was adsorbed on raw corn starch and hydrolyzed raw corn starch, and another (amy ii) was not adsorbed on raw corn starch and did not hydrolyze raw corn starch. amy i was considered to be the same as the extracellular alpha-amylase of s. bovis 148 in raw starch absorbability, ability to hydrolyze raw corn starch, enzymatic characteristics, n-terminal amino acid sequence, and mode of action on soluble starch. amy ii showed a unique pattern of oligosaccharide production from soluble starch compared with the extracellular alpha-amylase of s. bovis 148. amy ii was suggested to be an intracellular alpha-amylase of s. bovis 148.

TI  == regulation and cloning of the gene encoding amylase activity of the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is an important starch-degrading ruminal bacterium that has been implicated as being important in the etiology of a number of ruminal pathologies associated with diets high in grains. previous studies with s. bovis  have shown that amylase production was influenced by the growth substrate, but the nature of this regulation was not determined. the current study was conducted to better describe the regulatory phenomena and gain a better understanding of the molecular characteristics of this activity. nutritional experiments demonstrated that the presence of starch or the starch-derived disaccharide maltose was required for maximum amylase production. subsequent time-course experiments showed that amylase synthesis was induced by maltose and repressed by glucose, cellobiose, and fructose, while inulin and lactose had little effect on  enzyme accumulation. the effects of the added antibiotics rifampin and tetracycline were consistent with transcriptional control of amylase synthesis. analysis of s. bovis cells grown on glucose or maltose showed that they contained similar low levels of cyclic amp, indicating that it was unlikely that regulation of amylase synthesis was mediated through a mechanism involving this nucleotide.  the amylase gene from s. bovis jb1 was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli.  the amylase produced in e. coli was of lower molecular weight than that synthesized by s. bovis and had catalytic characteristics different from those of s. bovis amylase. when the gene was introduced back into s. bovis jb1, only one form of amylase activity was detected, indicating that the entire gene was present on this insert. the use of the amylase gene as a genetic probe for identification of s. bovis strains is discussed.

TI  == factors influencing the adherence of strains of streptococcus bovis and escherichia coli isolated from ruminal epithelium.
AB  == two strains of streptococcus bovis (a1 and a5) and one strain of escherichia coli (0141:h28) isolated from the surface of bovine ruminal mucous epithelium were examined for adherence to isolated and cultured ruminal epithelial cells. the e.  coli adhered to the target cell by means of fimbriae, which had several common properties with type 1 common fimbriae and caused mannose-sensitive haemagglutination. the a1 strain of s. bovis was devoid of fimbriae and its adherence to the epithelial surface was not inhibited by treatment with sugars or phenol-treated bacterial membrane from the same organism. it was therefore postulated that the bacterial glycocalyx of the s. bovis organisms acted as ligand. the extent of bacterial adherence depended on the state of differentiation of the target cell in both the isolated and the cultured ruminal  cell systems. the receptors for both adherent bacterial species were in all probability associated with the glycocalyx of the target cells.

AB  == ly163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. it inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group b streptococci and groups c, f, g and bovis streptococci with mics  of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. mic90 of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. ly163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with mic90 values of 16 mg/l for escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis. it had no activity against enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and pseudomonas and bacteroides spp. ly163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. it was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. for tem-1, the km = 354.7 microm, vmax = 2.5 micromoles/min/mg of protein, p99 km = 24.3 microm, vmax = 28.9 microm/min/micrograms of protein, staph. aureus pc km = 47.4 microm,  vmax = 2.7 micromoles/min/mg of protein. overall it had beta-lactamase stability  similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.

TI  == phagocytic and nitroblue tetrazolium reductive properties of bovine neutrophils for mammary pathogens.
AB  == a comparative evaluation of in vitro phagocytic and metabolic activities of freshly isolated bovine blood neutrophils from 26 cows was performed. degrees of  phagocytosis and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by neutrophils were measured using zymosan, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, salmonella sp., and brucella abortus opsonized with fresh bovine serum. percent phagocytosis and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by the neutrophils were determined by microscopic evaluation of stained coverslip smears. individual variation among cows was found in parameters measured, but age was not a contributing factor. phagocytosis was high (73 to 81%) for e. coli, salmonella sp., strep. agalactiae, and zymosan; intermediate (64%) for staph. aureus; and low (24 to 40%) for m. bovis and b. abortus. nitroblue tetrazolium reduction was distinctly lower than zymosan (74%) for all microorganisms. similar percentages (32 to 41%) of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction were observed for e. coli, staph. aureus, strep. agalactiae, and m. bovis; intermediate (28%) was obtained for salmonella sp. and lowest (11%) for b. abortus.

TI  == effects of source and washing of erythrocytes on growth of bacterial pathogens from the bovine mammary gland.
AB  == effects of source and washing of rbc on quantitative growth and hemolytic zone sizes of common bacterial pathogens of the bovine mammary gland were evaluated. blood samples used to prepare the blood agar media were obtained from 10 adult dairy cows, 10 dairy calves, and 10 sheep. hemolytic zone sizes produced by staphylococcus aureus were significantly (p less than 0.01) larger on blood agar  prepared with washed rbc than on blood agar prepared with nonwashed rbc, regardless of rbc source. with the exception of corynebacterium bovis, growth of  all bacteria was equivalent or significantly higher on medium prepared with washed rbc, compared with that on medium prepared with nonwashed rbc, regardless  of rbc source. significantly higher numbers of c bovis (p less than 0.01) and streptococcus agalactiae (p less than 0.01) were isolated on medium prepared with washed cow rbc. significantly higher numbers of str uberis (p less than 0.01) and s aureus (p less than 0.05) were isolated on medium prepared with washed sheep rbc and washed calf rbc, respectively. growth of escherichia coli was not affected by the rbc source. seemingly, rbc used in the preparation of medium should be washed. the source of rbc, as well as inter-animal variation, also should be considered in the quality control of medium.

TI  == bmy-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

TI  == comparative survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive fecal indicator bacteria in estuarine water.
AB  == the survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of escherichia coli,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus equinus, and two environmental isolates, ap17 and aq62, was examined in estuarine water. each strain was rendered resistant to a combination of two antibiotics by serial passage in increasing concentrations of antibiotics. cultures were incubated in filter-sterilized estuarine water for up to 7 days. recovery was assessed by examining colony-forming ability on media with and without antibiotics. none of the antibiotic-resistant forms survived longer than its antibiotic-sensitive counterpart in estuarine water. three of the resistant strains died off more rapidly than the antibiotic-sensitive wild type. survival of the test bacteria in estuarine water was as follows: sensitive and resistant aq62, resistant escherichia coli less than sensitive escherichia coli less than resistant ap17 less than resistant enterococcus faecium less than sensitive ap17, sensitive and  resistant s. equinus less than sensitive and resistant enterococcus faecalis, sensitive enterococcus faecium. the results supported the suggestion that fecal entercocci may serve as better indicators of fecal pollution than escherichia coli in marine ecosystems. moreover, the results indicated that the use of antibiotic-resistant mutants to follow the fate of bacteria in the environment is inappropriate without adequate studies to ensure that resistant and wild-type strains react similarly to environmental stressors.

AB  == immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hcg), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the cooh-terminal peptide of hcg beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hcg beta, demonstrated expression of hcg-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as streptococcus faecalis (three strains), staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli (single strains). the other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (cwd) variants,  one identified as streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with  a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. the other was a gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a gram-positive corynebacterium identified as a 'c. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hcg-like factor only during its phase as gram-negative diphtheroid. electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hcg-like material including the two cwd variants. collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hcg-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic  hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hcg molecule.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == evaluation of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in  patients with cirrhosis.
AB  == to determine the efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, 14 patients (7 males, 7 females)  with 16 gram-negative infective episodes (12 escherichia coli and 4 klebsiella pneumoniae) were treated with aztreonam infusions at doses of 1 gm per 8 hr for a planned 14-day period. ages ranged from 40 to 75 years with a mean of 57 +/- 10 years. all organisms were highly susceptible to aztreonam (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms per ml). serum antibiotic levels were 61.9 +/- 25.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 27 +/- 18.5 micrograms per ml (trough). ascitic fluid antibiotic levels were 33.6 +/- 22.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 32.7 +/- 16.8 micrograms per ml (trough). although the symptoms of infection were controlled within 3 days and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr, 10 patients (62.5%) died, with hepatorenal  syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage as the principal causes of death. three patients developed streptococcal superinfections during treatment; streptococcus  faecalis peritonitis in one case and spontaneous bacteremia due to streptococcus  equinus and streptococcus mutans in the other two. aztreonam was well tolerated and clinically and bacteriologically efficacious in controlling the infection. serum and ascitic fluid levels were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration for the causative organisms, suggesting that lower doses may achieve suitable therapeutic levels. a negative aspect of the antibiotic therapy was the superinfections. the high mortality rate was attributable to the  generally poor underlying condition of the patients.

TI  == antibiotic activity of an isocyanide metabolite of trichoderma hamatum against rumen bacteria.
AB  == a metabolite of trichoderma hamatum, 3-(3-isocyanocyclopent-2-enylidene)propionic acid, was tested for its effects on growth of and carbohydrate metabolism in 11 strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. to standardize the biological activity of this unstable metabolite, a rapid, aerobic disc diffusion assay was developed using escherichia coli atcc 11775. in an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid and containing a soluble carbohydrate, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the metabolite which completely inhibited growth of the rumen bacteria for 18 h at 39 degrees c was generally less than 10  micrograms x ml-1; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for megasphaera elsdenii b159 and streptococcus bovis pe(1)8 were 10-25 and 25-64 micrograms x ml-1, respectively. in general, the gram-negative strains were more sensitive than the gram positive. the minimum inhibitory concentration for bacteroides ruminicola 23 grown with glucose was 1 micrograms x ml-1; for b. ruminicola ga33  (glucose), b. succinogenes s85 (cellobiose), and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 (maltose), it was 2 microgram x ml-1. when added to a cellulose-containing rumen  fluid medium, 1-4 micrograms x ml-1 of the metabolite delayed cellulose hydrolysis by b. succinogenes s85, ruminococcus albus 7, and r. flavefaciens fd1  for up to 4 days, and 6-7 micrograms x ml-1 prevented hydrolysis for at least 1 month. in the presence of the metabolite, the proportion of acetate produced from soluble carbohydrate by the majority of strains increased, but with some strains  net production of acetate decreased relative to production of other acidic fermentation products.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == behaviour of campylobacter sputorum subspecies mucosalis in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  == gnotobiotic pigs were dosed orally with campylobacter sputorum subspecies mucosalis, either alone, or combined with rotavirus or non-pathogenic escherichia coli and streptococcus bovis to study the behaviour of c s mucosalis in defined conditions, to assess intracellular parasitism of enterocytes by c s mucosalis, and if possible to establish an experimental model of porcine intestinal adenomatosis. c s mucosalis colonised the gut of gnotobiotic pigs, persisting for up to 47 days after infection, but did not induce adenomatosis. despite evidence  of limited penetration of the mucosa up to two days after infection, the majority of c s mucosalis remained in the gut lumen. rotavirus did not enhance invasion of enterocytes by c s mucosalis. the presence of e coli and s bovis caused an increase in the total numbers of c s mucosalis in the gut, but did not affect their distribution. thus c s mucosalis was largely non-pathogenic in gnotobiotic  pigs.

TI  == the uptake and utilization of entodinium caudatum, bacteria, free amino acids and glucose by the rumen ciliate entodinium bursa.
AB  == washed suspensions of entodinium bursa were incubated anaerobically with entodinium caudatum, ten species of bacteria and a yeast. the rate of uptake and  digestion of these micro-organisms was investigated. protozoa grown in vivo did not engulf proteus mirabilis or klebsiella aerogenes but rapidly took up bacillus megaterium. selenomonas ruminantium, torulopsis glabrata and streptococcus bovis, although only the last was digested with release of soluble material into the medium. protozoa grown in vitro engulfed each of the bacteria tested, taking up megasphaera elsdenii and proteus mirabilis most rapidly. individual bacterial species and mixed rumen bacteria were engulfed more rapidly (up to 20 times) by protozoa grown in vivo than those grown in vitro, although the latter digested over 80% of the b. megaterium, escherichia coli and p. mirabilis taken up. labelled ent. caudatum was extensively digested after engulfment by ent. bursa. some of the digestion products were released into the medium but individual amino acids were transferred as such from ent. caudatum protein to ent. bursa protein.  engulfed bacteria and polysaccharide granules were transferred intact from one protozoon to the other. free amino acids were also taken up intact from the medium into protozoal protein but there was little biosynthesis of amino acids from glucose. when available for engulfment ent. caudatum was quantitatively a much more valuable source of amino acids for protein synthesis by ent. bursa than free amino acids or bacteria.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

AB  == runoff from a cow-calf pasture in eastern nebraska was monitored for total coliforms (tc), fecal coliforms (fc), and fecal streptococci (fs) during 1976, 1977, and 1978. bacteriological counts in runoff from both grazed and ungrazed areas generally exceeded recommended water quality standards. the fc group was the best indicator group of the impact of grazing. rainfall runoff from the grazed area contained 5 to 10 times more fc than runoff from the fenced, ungrazed area. there was little difference in tc counts between the two areas, but fs counts were higher in runoff from the ungrazed area and reflected the contributions from wildlife. recommended bacteriological water quality standards, developed for point source inputs, may be inappropriate for characterizing nonpoint source pollution from pasture runoff. the fc/fs ratio in pasture runoff  was useful in identifying the relative contributions of cattle and wildlife. ratios below 0.05 were indicative of wildlife sources and ratios above 0.1 were characteristic of grazing cattle. occasions when the fc/fs ratio of diluted cattle waste exceeded one resulted from differential aftergrowth and die-off between fc and fs. the fc/fs ratio and percentage of streptococcus bovis in pasture runoff are useful indicators for evaluating the effectiveness of livestock management practices for minimizing bacterial contamination of surface  water. the importance of choice of medium for the enumeration of fs in runoff derived from cattle wastes is discussed.

AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum  and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there  may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of  age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and  also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations  suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in  the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph  < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was  a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.

TI  == tetrahydrofolate-dependent biosynthesis of ribothymidine in transfer ribonucleic  acids of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == trimethoprim, an inhibitor that prevents tetrahydrofolate-dependent transmethylation reactions inbacteria, was used in a comparative study to discriminate between two possible biosynthetic pathways, either the s-adenosylmethionine or the tetrahydrofolate-dependent formation of ribothymidine (rt) in transfer ribonucleic acids (trna's) of several strains of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. rt-deficient trna's accumulate in trimethoprim-treated gram-positive streptococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus,  corynebacterium bovis, arthrobacter albidus, and all examined bacillaceae, except bacillus stearothermophilus. the rt-deficient rt-deficient trna's accept the methyl moiety from s-adenosylmethionine in vitro, with extracts from escherichia  coli (wild type) as a source of methylating enzymes; 90% of the incorporated methyl groups are present in rt. trimethoprim does not inhibit the biosynthesis of rt in trna of gram-negative enterobacteriaceae, rhizobium lupini, and pseudomonadaceae, suggesting that the rt-specific trna methyltransferases of these gram-negative strains use s-adenosylmethionine as coenzyme.

TI  == stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation by killed mycobacteria and other bacterial species.
AB  == killed mycobacteria and some mycobacterial fractions induced spleen cells from normal c3h mice to incorporate tritiated thymidine to a relatively high degree. thymocytes under the same conditions were not activated. however, incorporation of thymidine was significantly increased when mixtures of thymus and spleen cells were cultured in the presence of the inducers. a similar activation of spleen cells was displayed in the presence of gram-positive and gram-negative non-mycobacterial species.

TI  == distribution of group d streptococci in rivers and streams.
AB  == a study was undertaken to determine sources of bacteriological contamination of rivers as well as the ecology of faecal streptococci in natural and contaminated  waters. media used to characterize and speciate group d streptococci were also evaluated using isolates from the water and sediment. due to the low concentrations of faecal coliforms (fc) and faecal streptococci (fs) in river water samples, the fc/fs ratio was shown to be of little value in determining sources of contamination. high concentrations of fc and fs from sediment samples  gave more credible fc/fs ratios. the actual distribution of group d streptococcal species in rivers and streams was also shown. high concentrations of all division ii species (s. faecium, s. faecium var. casseliflavus, and s. faecium var. durans) were found in the water and sediment samples, with s. faecium var. durans comprising 50% of the total number of isolates. low concentrations of division i  group d streptococci (s. faecalis and varieties) were found, while only one isolation of division iii group d streptococci (s. bovis and s. equinus) was made.

TI  == effects of estrus and exogenous estrogen on circulating neutrophils and milk somatic cell concentration, neutrophil phagocytosis, and occurrence of clinical mastitis in cows.
AB  == in a study involving 56 quarters (14 cows), it was seen that standing estrus did  not affect circulating neutrophil and milk somatic cell concentrations, neutrophil phagocytosis, milk production, or occurrence of clinical mastitis. the subcutaneous injection of 17beta-estradiol (e2) (0.05 mg/kg of body weight 2 times daily for 2 consecutive days) did not affect neutrophil phagocytosis or milk somatic cell values. however, a significant increase in circulating neutrophils and a significant decrease in milk production were observed. the injection of e2 was followed by clinical mastitis in 4 uninfected quarters, in 7  quarters infected with corynebacterium bovis, and in 1 quarter infected with streptococcus uberis and escherichia coli.

TI  == selective adhesion of microorganisms to the ductular epithelium of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and corynebacterium bovis were examined for their ability to adhere to the ductular epithelial cells of the bovine udder. s. agalactiae and s. aureus adhered readily and in large numbers, whereas the other organisms adhered  poorly or not at all. the organisms showing the ability to adhere are those which frequently cause mastitis. these data suggest that selective adherence to the ductular epithelium may be the first stage in the pathogenesis of streptococcal and staphylococcal mastitis.

TI  == comparative survival of indicator bacteria and enteric pathogens in well water.
AB  == the comparative survival of various fecal indicator bacteria and enteric pathogens was studied in a stable well water supply by using membrane chambers. there was more variation in the 29 coliform cultures and they died more rapidly,  as a group, than the 20 enterococcus cultures that were examined. the comparative survival of the organisms tested follows: aeromonas sp. > the shigellae (shigella flexneri, s. sonnei, and s. dysenteriae) > fecal streptococci > coliforms = some  salmonellae (salmonella enteritidis ser. paratyphi a and d, s. enteritidis ser. typhimurium) > streptococcus equinus > vibrio cholerae > salmonella typhi > streptococcus bovis > salmonella enteritidis ser. paratyphi b. s. bovis had a more rapid die-off than did s. equinus, but both had significantly shorter half-lives than the other streptococci. the natural populations of indicator bacteria from human and elk fecal material declined similarly to the pure cultures tested, whereas the die-off of fecal streptococci exceeded the coliforms from bovine fecal material.

TI  == shared antigens between heterologous bacterial species.
AB  == sera from normal rabbits were shown to have antibodies that bound radiolabeled test antigens derived from many taxonomically unrelated bacteria. sera from rabbits that had been immunized with sonically treated material of 12 different bacteria, including m. bovis strain bcg, had antibodies that bound not only radiolabeled homologous test antigens but also radiolabeled antigens from many unrelated bacteria. binding by normal and immunized sera to radiolabeled test antigens was inhibited by homologous unlabeled test antigens but not by substances such as bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sheep erythrocytes, and endotoxin. the broad range of shared or cross-reactivity among  antigens in bacteria may explain the presence of antibodies to many bacteria in sera from normal humans and previously unimmunized experimental animals. the presence of these antibodies raises the question whether resistance to many bacterial infections may be partly due to immune mechanisms, whether cellular or  humoral, that have been stimulated by unrelated bacteria.
