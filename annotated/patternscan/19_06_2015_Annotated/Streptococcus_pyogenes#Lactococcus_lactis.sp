TI  == influenza viral neuraminidase primes bacterial coinfection through tgf-beta-mediated expression of host cell receptors.
AB  == influenza infection predisposes the host to secondary bacterial pneumonia, which  is a major cause of mortality during influenza epidemics. the molecular mechanisms underlying the bacterial coinfection remain elusive. neuraminidase (na) of influenza a virus (iav) enhances bacterial adherence and also activates tgf-beta. because tgf-beta can up-regulate host adhesion molecules such as fibronectin and integrins for bacterial binding, we hypothesized that activated tgf-beta during iav infection contributes to secondary bacterial infection by up-regulating these host adhesion molecules. flow cytometric analyses of a human  lung epithelial cell line indicated that the expression of fibronectin and alpha5 integrin was up-regulated after iav infection or treatment with recombinant na and was reversed through the inhibition of tgf-beta signaling. iav-promoted adherence of group a streptococcus (gas) and other coinfective pathogens that require fibronectin for binding was prevented significantly by the inhibition of  tgf-beta. however, iav did not promote the adherence of lactococcus lactis unless this bacterium expressed the fibronectin-binding protein of gas. mouse experiments showed that iav infection enhanced gas colonization in the lungs of wild-type animals but not in the lungs of mice deficient in tgf-beta signaling. taken together, these results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism: iav na  enhances the expression of cellular adhesins through the activation of tgf-beta,  leading to increased bacterial loading in the lungs. our results suggest that tgf-beta and cellular adhesins may be potential pharmaceutical targets for the prevention of coinfection.

TI  == a novel live vector group a streptococcal emm type 9 vaccine delivered intranasally protects mice against challenge infection with emm type 9 group a streptococci.
AB  == the availability of a protective vaccine against streptococcus pyogenes (group a  streptococcus [gas]) is a priority for public health worldwide. here, we have generated six live vaccine strains, each engineered to express an n-terminal m protein peptide from one of six of the most prevalent emm types of gas (m1, m2, m4, m9, m12, and m28). the vaccine strains are based on a food-grade lactococcus  lactis strain and do not bear any antibiotic resistance. mice immunized with the  vaccine strain expressing the m9 peptide (termed here the l. lactis m9 strain) showed high titers of serum antibodies when delivered intranasally. mice immunized with the l. lactis m9 strain were protected against infection after intranasal challenge with type 9 streptococci. several parameters of disease, such as weight loss, body temperature, colony counts in mouth washes, and lung histology, were significantly improved in immunized mice compared to naive control mice. our results indicate that intranasal delivery of the l. lactis m9 strain live bacterial vaccine induced gas-specific igg titers, prevented pharyngeal colonization of gas, and protected mice from disease upon challenge. the design of this vaccine prototype may provide a lower cost alternative to vaccines comprised of purified recombinant proteins.

TI  == structure and activity of streptococcus pyogenes sipa: a signal peptidase-like protein essential for pilus polymerisation.
AB  == the pili expressed on the surface of the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes play an important role in host cell attachment, colonisation and pathogenesis. these pili are built from two or three components, an adhesin subunit at the tip, a major pilin that forms a polymeric shaft, and a basal pilin that is attached to the cell wall. assembly is carried out by specific sortase (cysteine transpeptidase) enzyme. these components are encoded in a small gene cluster within the s. pyogenes genome, often together with another protein, sipa, whose function is unknown. we show through functional assays, carried out by expressing the s. pyogenes pilus components in lactococcus lactis, sipa from the clinically  important m1t1 strain is essential for pilus assembly, and that sipa function is  likely to be conserved in all s. pyogenes. from the crystal structure of sipa we  confirm that sipa belongs to the family of bacterial signal peptidases (spases),  which process the signal-peptides of secreted proteins. in contrast to a previous arm-swapped sipa dimer, this present structure shows that its principal domain closely resembles the catalytic domain of spases and has a very similar peptide-binding cleft, but it lacks the catalytic ser and lys residues characteristic of spases. in sipa these are replaced by asp and gly residues, which play no part in activity. we propose that sipa functions by binding a key component at the bacterial cell surface, in a conformation that facilitates pilus assembly.

TI  == spyad, a moonlighting protein of group a streptococcus contributing to bacterial  division and host cell adhesion.
AB  == group a streptococcus (gas) is a human pathogen causing a wide repertoire of mild and severe diseases for which no vaccine is yet available. we recently reported the identification of three protein antigens that in combination conferred wide protection against gas infection in mice. here we focused our attention on the characterization of one of these three antigens, spy0269, a highly conserved, surface-exposed, and immunogenic protein of unknown function. deletion of the spy0269 gene in a gas m1 isolate resulted in very long bacterial chains, which is indicative of an impaired capacity of the knockout mutant to properly divide. confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the protein was mainly localized at the cell septum and could interact in vitro with  the cell division protein ftsz, leading us to hypothesize that spy0269 is a member of the gas divisome machinery. predicted structural domains and sequence homologies with known streptococcal adhesins suggested that this antigen could also play a role in mediating gas interaction with host cells. this hypothesis was confirmed by showing that recombinant spy0269 could bind to mammalian epithelial cells in vitro and that lactococcus lactis expressing spy0269 on its cell surface could adhere to mammalian cells in vitro and to mice nasal mucosa in vivo. on the basis of these data, we believe that spy0269 is involved both in bacterial cell division and in adhesion to host cells and we propose to rename this multifunctional moonlighting protein as spyad (streptococcus pyogenes adhesion and division protein).

TI  == organism-adapted specificity of the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == pyruvate kinase (pyk) is a critical allosterically regulated enzyme that links glycolysis, the primary energy metabolism, to cellular metabolism. lactic acid bacteria rely almost exclusively on glycolysis for their energy production under  anaerobic conditions, which reinforces the key role of pyk in their metabolism. these organisms are closely related, but have adapted to a huge variety of native environments. they include food-fermenting organisms, important symbionts in the  human gut, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens. in contrast to the rather conserved inhibition of pyk by inorganic phosphate, the activation of pyk shows high variability in the type of activating compound between different lactic acid bacteria. system-wide comparative studies of the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria are required to understand the reasons for the diversity of these closely related microorganisms. these require knowledge of the identities of the  enzyme modifiers. here, we predict potential allosteric activators of pyks from three lactic acid bacteria which are adapted to different native environments. we used protein structure-based molecular modeling and enzyme kinetic modeling to predict and validate potential activators of pyk. specifically, we compared the electrostatic potential and the binding of phosphate moieties at the allosteric binding sites, and predicted potential allosteric activators by docking. we then  made a kinetic model of lactococcus lactis pyk to relate the activator predictions to the intracellular sugar-phosphate conditions in lactic acid bacteria. this strategy enabled us to predict fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as the sole activator of the enterococcus faecalis pyk, and to predict that the pyks from streptococcus pyogenes and lactobacillus plantarum show weaker specificity for their allosteric activators, while still having fructose 1,6-bisphosphate play the main activator role in vivo. these differences in the specificity of allosteric activation may reflect adaptation to different environments with different concentrations of activating compounds. the combined computational approach employed can readily be applied to other enzymes.

TI  == kinetic characterization of arginine deiminase and carbamate kinase from streptococcus pyogenes m49.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus, gas) is an important human pathogen causing mild superficial infections of skin and mucous membranes, but also life-threatening systemic diseases. s. pyogenes and other prokaryotic organisms use the arginine deiminase system (ads) for survival in acidic environments. in this study, the arginine deiminase (ad), and carbamate kinase (ck) from s. pyogenes m49 strain 591 were heterologously expressed in escherichia coli dh5alpha, purified, and kinetically characterized. ad and ck from s. pyogenes m49 share high amino acid sequence similarity with the respective enzymes from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 (45.6% and 53.5% identical amino acids) and enterococcus faecalis v583 (66.8% and 66.8% identical amino acids). we found that the arginine deiminase of s. pyogenes is not allosterically regulated by the intermediates and products of the arginine degradation (e.g., atp, citrulline, carbamoyl phosphate). the km and vmax values for arginine were 1.13+/-0.12mm (mean+/-sd) and 1.51+/-0.07mumol/min/mg protein. the carbamate kinase is inhibited by atp but unaffected by arginine and citrulline. the km and  vmax values for adp were 0.72+/-0.08mm and 1.10+/-0.10mumol/min/mg protein and the km for carbamoyl phosphate was 0.65+/-0.07mm. the optimum ph and temperature  for both enzymes were 6.5 and 37 degrees c, respectively.

TI  == regulation of the activity of lactate dehydrogenases from four lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == despite high similarity in sequence and catalytic properties, the l-lactate dehydrogenases (ldhs) in lactic acid bacteria (lab) display differences in their  regulation that may arise from their adaptation to different habitats. we combined experimental and computational approaches to investigate the effects of  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (fbp), phosphate (pi), and ionic strength (nacl concentration) on six ldhs from four labs studied at ph 6 and ph 7. we found that 1) the extent of activation by fbp (kact) differs. lactobacillus plantarum ldh is not regulated by fbp, but the other ldhs are activated with increasing sensitivity in the following order: enterococcus faecalis ldh2 </= lactococcus lactis ldh2 < e. faecalis ldh1 < l. lactis ldh1 </= streptococcus pyogenes ldh. this trend reflects the electrostatic properties in the allosteric binding site of the ldh enzymes. 2) for l. plantarum, s. pyogenes, and e. faecalis, the effects of pi are distinguishable from the effect of changing ionic strength by adding nacl. 3) addition of pi inhibits e. faecalis ldh2, whereas in the absence  of fbp, pi is an activator of s. pyogenes ldh, e. faecalis ldh1, and l. lactis ldh1 and ldh2 at ph 6. these effects can be interpreted by considering the computed binding affinities of pi to the catalytic and allosteric binding sites of the enzymes modeled in protonation states corresponding to ph 6 and ph 7. overall, the results show a subtle interplay among the effects of pi, fbp, and ph that results in different regulatory effects on the ldhs of different labs.

TI  == the agi/ii family adhesin aspa is required for respiratory infection by streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (gas) is a human pathogen that causes pharyngitis and invasive diseases such as toxic shock syndrome and sepsis. the upper respiratory  tract is the primary reservoir from which gas can infect new hosts and cause disease. the factors involved in colonisation are incompletely known however. previous evidence in oral streptococci has shown that the agi/ii family proteins  are involved. we hypothesized that the aspa member of this family might be involved in gas colonization. we describe a novel mouse model of gas colonization of the nasopharynx and lower respiratory tract to elucidate these interactions. we used two clinical m serotypes expressing aspa, and their aspa gene deletant isogenic mutants in experiments using adherence assays to respiratory epithelium, macrophage phagocytosis and neutrophil killing assays and in vivo models of respiratory tract colonisation and infection. we demonstrated the requirement for aspa in colonization of the respiratory tract. aspa mutants were cleared from the respiratory tract and were deficient in adherence to epithelial cells, and susceptible to phagocytosis. expression of aspa in the surrogate host lactococcus lactis protected bacteria from phagocytosis. our results suggest that aspa has an essential role in respiratory infection, and may function as a novel anti-phagocytic factor.

TI  == role of phosphate in the central metabolism of two lactic acid bacteria--a comparative systems biology approach.
AB  == lactic acid-producing bacteria survive in distinct environments, but show common  metabolic characteristics. here we studied the dynamic interactions of the central metabolism in lactococcus lactis, extensively used as a starter culture in the dairy industry, and streptococcus pyogenes, a human pathogen. glucose-pulse experiments and enzymatic measurements were performed to parameterize kinetic models of glycolysis. significant improvements were made to  existing kinetic models for l. lactis, which subsequently accelerated the development of the first kinetic model of s. pyogenes glycolysis. the models revealed an important role for extracellular phosphate in the regulation of central metabolism and the efficient use of glucose. thus, phosphate, which is rarely taken into account as an independent species in models of central metabolism, should be considered more thoroughly in the analysis of metabolic systems in the future. insufficient phosphate supply can lead to a strong inhibition of glycolysis at high glucose concentrations in both species, but this was more severe in s. pyogenes. s. pyogenes is more efficient at converting glucose to atp, showing a higher tendency towards heterofermentative energy metabolism than l. lactis. our comparative systems biology approach revealed that the glycolysis of l. lactis and s. pyogenes have similar characteristics, but are adapted to their individual natural habitats with respect to phosphate regulation.

TI  == from meadows to milk to mucosa - adaptation of streptococcus and lactococcus species to their nutritional environments.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are indigenous to food-related habitats as well as associated with the mucosal surfaces of animals. the lab family streptococcaceae  consists of the genera lactococcus and streptococcus. members of the family include the industrially important species lactococcus lactis, which has a long history safe use in the fermentative food industry, and the disease-causing streptococci streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. the central metabolic pathways of the streptococcaceae family have been extensively studied because of their relevance in the industrial use of some species, as well as their influence on virulence of others. recent developments in high-throughput proteomic and dna-microarray techniques, in in vivo nmr studies, and importantly  in whole-genome sequencing have resulted in new insights into the metabolism of the streptococcaceae family. the development of cost-effective high-throughput sequencing has resulted in the publication of numerous whole-genome sequences of  lactococcal and streptococcal species. comparative genomic analysis of these closely related but environmentally diverse species provides insight into the evolution of this family of lab and shows that the relatively small genomes of members of the streptococcaceae family have been largely shaped by the nutritionally rich environments they inhabit.

TI  == the streptococcal collagen-like protein-1 (scl1) is a significant determinant for biofilm formation by group a streptococcus.
AB  == background: group a streptococcus (gas) is a human-specific pathogen responsible  for a number of diseases characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations. during host colonization gas-cell aggregates or microcolonies are observed in tissues. gas biofilm, which is an in vitro equivalent of tissue microcolony, has only recently been studied and little is known about the specific surface determinants that aid biofilm formation. in this study, we demonstrate that surface-associated streptococcal collagen-like protein-1 (scl1)  plays an important role in gas biofilm formation. results: biofilm formation by m1-, m3-, m28-, and m41-type gas strains, representing an intraspecies breadth, were analyzed spectrophotometrically following crystal violet staining, and characterized using confocal and field emission scanning electron microscopy. the m41-type strain formed the most robust biofilm under static conditions, followed  by m28- and m1-type strains, while the m3-type strains analyzed here did not form biofilm under the same experimental conditions. differences in architecture and cell-surface morphology were observed in biofilms formed by the m1- and m41-wild-type strains, accompanied by varying amounts of deposited extracellular  matrix and differences in cell-to-cell junctions within each biofilm. importantly, all scl1-negative mutants examined showed significantly decreased ability to form biofilm in vitro. furthermore, the scl1 protein expressed on the  surface of a heterologous host, lactococcus lactis, was sufficient to induce biofilm formation by this organism. conclusions: overall, this work (i) identifies variations in biofilm formation capacity among pathogenically different gas strains, (ii) identifies gas surface properties that may aid in biofilm stability and, (iii) establishes that the scl1 surface protein is an important determinant of gas biofilm, which is sufficient to enable biofilm formation in the heterologous host lactococcus. in summary, the gas surface adhesin scl1 may have an important role in biofilm-associated pathogenicity.

TI  == streptococcus pyogenes antigen i/ii-family polypeptide aspa shows differential ligand-binding properties and mediates biofilm formation.
AB  == the streptococcal antigen i/ii (agi/ii)-family polypeptides are cell wall-anchored adhesins expressed by most indigenous oral streptococci. proteins sharing 30-40% overall amino acid sequence similarities with agi/ii-family proteins are also expressed by streptococcus pyogenes. the s. pyogenes m28_spy1325 polypeptide (designated aspa) displays an agi/ii primary structure, with alanine-rich (a) and proline-rich (p) repeats flanking a v region that is projected distal from the cell. in this study it is shown that aspa from serotype m28 s. pyogenes, when expressed on surrogate host lactococcus lactis, confers binding to immobilized salivary agglutinin gp-340. this binding was blocked by antibodies to the aspa-vp region. in contrast, the n-terminal region of aspa was  deficient in binding fluid-phase gp-340, and l. lactis cells expressing aspa were not agglutinated by gp-340. deletion of the aspa gene from two different m28 strains of s. pyogenes abrogated their abilities to form biofilms on saliva-coated surfaces. in each mutant strain, biofilm formation was restored by  trans complementation of the aspa deletion. in addition, expression of aspa protein on the surface of l. lactis conferred biofilm-forming ability. taken collectively, the results provide evidence that aspa is a biofilm-associated adhesin that may function in host colonization by s. pyogenes.

TI  == defense from the group a streptococcus by active and passive vaccination with the streptococcal hemoprotein receptor.
AB  == background: the worldwide burden of the group a streptococcus (gas) primary infection and sequelae is considerable, although immunization programs with broad coverage of the hyper variable gas are still missing. we evaluate the streptococcal hemoprotein receptor (shr), a conserved streptococcal protein, as a vaccine candidate against gas infection. methods: mice were immunized intraperitoneally with purified shr or intranasally with shr-expressing lactococcus lactis. the resulting humoral response in serum and secretions was determined. we evaluated protection from gas infection in mice after active or passive vaccination with shr, and shr antiserum was tested for bactericidal activity. results: a robust shr-specific immunoglobulin (ig) g response was observed in mouse serum after intraperitoneal vaccination with shr. intranasal immunization elicited both a strong igg reaction in the serum and a specific iga  reaction in secretions. shr immunization in both models allowed enhanced protection from systemic gas challenge. rabbit shr antiserum was opsonizing, and  mice that were administrated with shr antiserum prior to the infection demonstrated a significantly higher survival rate than did mice treated with normal rabbit serum. conclusions: shr is a promising vaccine candidate that is capable of eliciting bactericidal antibody response and conferring immunity against systemic gas infection in both passive and active vaccination models.

TI  == characterization of three lactic acid bacteria and their isogenic ldh deletion mutants shows optimization for yatp (cell mass produced per mole of atp) at their physiological phs.
AB  == several lactic acid bacteria use homolactic acid fermentation for generation of atp. here we studied the role of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme on the general  physiology of the three homolactic acid bacteria lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. of note, deletion of the ldh genes hardly affected the growth rate in chemically defined medium under microaerophilic conditions. however, the growth rate was affected in rich medium. furthermore, deletion of ldh affected the ability for utilization of various substrates as a carbon source. a switch to mixed acid fermentation was observed during glucose-limited continuous growth and was dependent on the growth rate for s. pyogenes and on the ph for e. faecalis. in s. pyogenes and l. lactis, a change in ph resulted in a clear change in y(atp) (cell mass produced per mole of atp). the ph that showed the highest y(atp) corresponded to the ph of the natural habitat of the organisms.

TI  == chemokine-cleaving streptococcus pyogenes protease spycep is necessary and sufficient for bacterial dissemination within soft tissues and the respiratory tract.
AB  == spycep is a streptococcus pyogenes protease that cleaves cxcl8/il-8 and its activity is associated with human invasive disease severity. we investigated the  role of spycep in s. pyogenes necrotizing fasciitis and respiratory tract infection in mice using isogenic strains differing only in spycep expression. spycep cleaved human cxcl1, 2, 6 and 8 plus murine cxcl1 and 2 at a structurally  conserved site. mice were infected in thigh muscle with a strain of s. pyogenes that expresses a high level of spycep, or with an isogenic non-spycep expressing  strain. spycep expression by s. pyogenes hindered bacterial clearance from muscle, and enhanced bacterial spread, associated with cleavage of murine chemoattractant cxcl1. mice were then infected with lactococcus lactis strains that differed only in spycep expression. in contrast to the parent l. lactis strain (lacks spycep), which was avirulent when administered intramuscularly, infection with a strain that expressed spycep heterologously led to dramatic systemic illness within 24 h, failure to clear bacteria from muscle and marked dissemination to other organs. in the upper airways, spycep expression was required for survival of l. lactis but not s. pyogenes. however, dissemination of s. pyogenes to the lung was spycep-dependent and was associated with evidence of  chemokine cleavage. taken together, the studies provide clear evidence that spycep is necessary and sufficient for systemic bacterial dissemination from a soft tissue focus in this model and also underlies dissemination in the respiratory tract.

TI  == a foreign protein incorporated on the tip of t3 pili in lactococcus lactis elicits systemic and mucosal immunity.
AB  == the use of lactococcus lactis to deliver a chosen antigen to the mucosal surface  has been shown to elicit an immune response in mice and is a possible method of vaccination in humans. the recent discovery on gram-positive bacteria of pili that are covalently attached to the bacterial surface and the elucidation of the  residues linking the major and minor subunits of such pili suggests that the presentation of an antigen on the tip of pili external to the surface of l. lactis might constitute a successful vaccine strategy. as a proof of principle, we have fused a foreign protein (the escherichia coli maltose-binding protein) to the c-terminal region of the native tip protein (cpa) of the t3 pilus derived from streptococcus pyogenes and expressed this fusion protein (mbp*) in l. lactis. we find that mbp* is incorporated into pili in this foreign host, as shown by western blot analyses of cell wall proteins and by immunogold electron microscopy. furthermore, since the mbp* on these pili retains its native biological activity, it appears to retain its native structure. mucosal immunization of mice with this l. lactis strain expressing pilus-linked mbp* results in production of both a systemic and a mucosal response (igg and iga antibodies) against the mbp antigen. we suggest that this type of mucosal vaccine delivery system, which we term uptop (for unhindered presentation on tips of pili), may provide an inexpensive and stable alternative to current mechanisms of immunization for many serious human pathogens.

TI  == comparative genomics and transduction potential of enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  == to determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin c, norfloxacin, and uv radiation. thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and  restriction mapping. from these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. three groups of phages, phifl1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with phifl1a to c and  phifl2a and b sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while phifl3a and b share 37 to 41% identity with phifl1 and 2. phifl4a shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages phifl1 to 3. the phifl3a and b phages possess a high dna sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. homologs of the streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, pbla and pblb, are encoded on each sequenced e. faecalis phage. few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. e. faecalis jh2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in galleria mellonella. several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of g. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. the eight phages were tested for their ability to package host dna, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains og1rf and jh2-2.

AB  == integrative and conjugative elements (ices), also called conjugative transposons, are genomic islands that excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate in the genome of the recipient bacterium. the current investigation shows the intraspecies conjugative transfer of the first described ices in streptococcus thermophilus, icest1 and icest3. mitomycin c, a dna-damaging agent, derepresses icest3 conjugative transfer almost 25-fold. the icest3 host range was determined  using various members of the firmicutes as recipients. whereas numerous icest3 transconjugants of streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis were recovered, only one transconjugant of lactococcus lactis was obtained. the newly  incoming ices, except the one from l. lactis, are site-specifically integrated into the 3' end of the fda gene and are still able to excise in these transconjugants. furthermore, icest3 was retransferred from e. faecalis to s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmids carrying different parts of the icest1 recombination module were used to show that the integrase gene is required for the site-specific integration and excision of the ices, whereas the excisionase gene is required for the site-specific excision only.

TI  == shr is a broad-spectrum surface receptor that contributes to adherence and virulence in group a streptococcus.
AB  == group a streptococcus (gas) is a common hemolytic pathogen that produces a range  of suppurative infections and autoimmune sequelae in humans. shr is an exported protein in gas, which binds in vitro to hemoglobin, myoglobin, and the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex. we previously reported that shr is found in association with whole gas cells and in culture supernatant. here, we demonstrate that cell-associated shr could not be released from the bacteria by the muralytic enzyme mutanolysin and was instead localized to the membrane. shr was available,  however, on the exterior of gas, exposed to the extracellular environment. in vitro binding and competition assays demonstrated that in addition to hemoprotein binding, purified shr specifically interacts with immobilized fibronectin and laminin. the absence of typical fibronectin-binding motifs indicates that a new protein pattern is involved in the binding of shr to the extracellular matrix. recombinant lactococcus lactis cells expressing shr on the bacterial surface gained the ability to bind to immobilized fibronectin, suggesting that shr can function as an adhesin. the inactivation of shr resulted in a 40% reduction in the attachment to human epithelial cells in comparison to the parent strain. gas  infection elicited a high titer of shr antibodies in sera from convalescent mice, demonstrating that shr is expressed in vivo. the shr mutant was attenuated for virulence in an intramuscular zebrafish model system. in summary, this study identifies shr as being a new microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules in gas that mediates attachment to epithelial cells and contributes to the infection process.

TI  == morphology, genome sequence, and structural proteome of type phage p335 from lactococcus lactis.
AB  == lactococcus lactis phage p335 is a virulent type phage for the species that bears its name and belongs to the siphoviridae family. morphologically, p335 resembled  the l. lactis phages tp901-1 and tuc2009, except for a shorter tail and a different collar/whisker structure. its 33,613-bp double-stranded dna genome had  50 open reading frames. putative functions were assigned to 29 of them. unlike other sequenced genomes from lactococcal phages belonging to this species, p335 did not have a lysogeny module. however, it did carry a dutpase gene, the most conserved gene among this phage species. comparative genomic analyses revealed a  high level of identity between the morphogenesis modules of the phages p335, ul36, tp901-1, and tuc2009 and two putative prophages of l. lactis sk11. differences were noted in genes coding for receptor-binding proteins, in agreement with their distinct host ranges. sixteen structural proteins of phage p335 were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. a 2.8-kb  insertion was recognized between the putative genes coding for the activator of late transcription (alt) and the small terminase subunit (ters). four genes within this region were autonomously late transcribed and possibly under the control of alt. three of the four deduced proteins had similarities with proteins from streptococcus pyogenes prophages, suggesting that p335 acquired this module  from another phage genome. the genetic diversity of the p335 species indicates that they are exceptional models for studying the modular theory of phage evolution.

TI  == scavenger receptor gp340 aggregates group a streptococci by binding pili.
AB  == group a streptococci (gas) are the most frequent cause of bacterial pharyngitis.  the first obstacle to gas colonization of the pharynx is saliva. as well as forming a physical barrier, saliva contains components of innate and acquired immunity. previous work has shown that saliva induces bacterial aggregation, which may serve as a clearance mechanism. as the aggregation of some oral streptococci in saliva is mediated by long proteinaceous appendages, we hypothesized that pili of gas might behave similarly. wild-type gas m1 strain sf370 aggregated in saliva, while pilus-defective mutants did not. similarly, heterologous expression of diverse gas pili on the surface of lactococcus lactis  induced aggregation in saliva, while control strains were unaffected. further studies revealed that aggregating bacteria bound salivary component gp340. purified gp340 aggregated wild-type gas and l. lactis expressing gas pili, but not control strains. gas pilus-defective mutants were abrogated in gp340 binding  and aggregation. furthermore, gp340-mediated aggregation reduced bacterial adhesion to human epithelial cells, suggesting a role in host defence.

AB  == streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a porcine and human pathogen with adhesive and invasive properties. in other streptococci, large surface-associated proteins (>100 kda) of the mscramm family (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) are key players in interactions with host tissue. in this study, we identified a novel opacity factor of s. suis (ofs) with structural homology to members of the mscramm family. the n-terminal region of ofs is homologous to the respective regions of fibronectin-binding protein a (fnba) of streptococcus dysgalactiae and the serum opacity factor (sof) of streptococcus pyogenes. similar to these two proteins, the n-terminal domain of ofs opacified horse serum. serum opacification activity was detectable in sodium dodecyl sulfate extracts of wild-type s. suis but not in extracts of isogenic ofs knockout mutants. heterologous expression of ofs in lactococcus lactis demonstrated that a high level of expression of ofs is sufficient to provide surface-associated serum opacification activity. furthermore, serum opacification could be inhibited by an antiserum against recombinant ofs. the c-terminal repetitive sequence elements of ofs differed significantly from the respective repeat regions of fnba and sof as well as from the consensus sequence of the fibronectin-binding repeats of mscramms. accordingly, fibronectin binding was not detectable in recombinant ofs. to investigate the putative function of ofs in the pathogenesis of invasive s. suis diseases, piglets were experimentally infected with an isogenic mutant strain in which the ofs gene had been knocked out by an in-frame deletion. the mutant was severely attenuated in virulence but not in colonization, demonstrating that ofs represents a novel virulence determinant of  s. suis.

TI  == different subcellular locations of secretome components of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria contain different types of secretion systems for the transport of proteins into or across the cytoplasmic membrane. recent studies on  subcellular localization of specific components of these secretion systems and their substrates have shown that they can be present at various locations in the  cell. the translocons of the general sec secretion system in the rod-shaped bacterium bacillus subtilis have been shown to localize in spirals along the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas the translocons in the coccoid streptococcus pyogenes are located in a microdomain near the septum. in both bacteria the sec translocons appear to be located near the sites of cell wall synthesis. the tat secretion system, which is used for the transport of folded proteins, probably localizes in the cytoplasmic membrane and at the cell poles of b. subtilis. in lactococcus lactis the abc transporter dedicated to the transport of a small antimicrobial peptide is distributed throughout the membrane. possible mechanisms for maintaining the localization of these secretion machineries involve their interaction with proteins of the cytoskeleton or components of the cell wall synthesis machinery, or the presence of lipid subdomains surrounding the transport systems.

TI  == serum opacity factor promotes group a streptococcal epithelial cell invasion and  virulence.
AB  == serum opacity factor (sof) is a bifunctional cell surface protein expressed by 40-50% of group a streptococcal (gas) strains comprised of a c-terminal domain that binds fibronectin and an n-terminal domain that mediates opacification of mammalian sera. the sof gene was recently discovered to be cotranscribed in a two-gene operon with a gene encoding another fibronectin-binding protein, sfbx. we compared the ability of a sof(+) wild-type serotype m49 gas strain and isogenic mutants lacking sof or sfbx to invade cultured hep-2 human pharyngeal epithelial cells. elimination of sof led to a significant decrease in hep-2 intracellular invasion while loss of sfbx had minimal effect. the hypoinvasive phenotype of the sof(-) mutant could be restored upon complementation with the sof gene on a plasmid vector, and heterologous expression of sof49 in m1 gas or lactococcus lactis conferred marked increases in hep-2 cell invasion. studies using a mutant sof49 gene lacking the fibronectin-binding domain indicated that the n-terminal opacification domain of sof contributes to hep-2 invasion independent of the c-terminal fibronectin binding domain, findings corroborated by observations that a purified sof n-terminal peptide could promote latex bead adherence to hep-2 cells and inhibit gas invasion of hep-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. finally, the first in vivo studies to employ a single gene allelic replacement mutant of sof demonstrate that this protein contributes to gas virulence in a murine model of necrotizing skin infection.

TI  == [construction and identification of exogenous gene expression system in lactococcus lactis].
AB  == objective: to construct and characterize an exogenous gene expression system in lactococcus lactis. methods: pcr-based gene assembly was used to synthesize the gene sequence containing p59 promoter, usp45 signal peptide, ribosome binding site and multiple cloning site. plasmid pbs-pu was obtained after ligation of the assembled sequence with pbluescript ii sk (+), and the terminator of usp45 protein was added to construct the recombinant plasmid pnbc1000. the gene coding  for streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein was amplified and cloned into pnbc1000 to obtain the plasmid pnbc2000. to characterize the expression system, enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) gene was amplified from the plasmid pegfp-n1 and cloned into pnbc2000. laser scanning confocal microscope was used to observe the  bacteria containing pnbc2000, pnbc2000-egfp or pbs-egfp. results: green fluorescence was visualized in the bacteria containing pnbc2000-egfp, but not in  the bacteria containing pnbc2000 or pbs-egfp. conclusion: the plasmids pnbc1000 and pnbc2000 containing p59 promoter, usp45 signal peptide, ribosome binding site and multiple cloning sites are successfully constructed, which are capable of expressing exogenous gene in lactococcus lactis.

TI  == engagement of cd46 and alpha5beta1 integrin by group a streptococci is required for efficient invasion of epithelial cells.
AB  == membrane cofactor protein (mcp or cd46), a widely distributed complement regulatory human protein, is a cell surface receptor for many pathogens including group a streptococci (gas). the surface m protein of gas binds cd46 and mediates  gas adherence to keratinocytes. in the present study, we studied the role of cd46 in gas invasion of human lung epithelial cells, a549. anti-cd46 antibody which specifically blocks the domain to which m protein binds inhibited adherence to and invasion of a549 cells by gas. moreover, downregulation of cd46 expression on a549 by rna interference resulted in reduced invasion of these cells by gas. a mutant form of cd46 with a deletion in the cytoplasmic domain was overexpressed in a549 cells, which resulted in partial inhibition of invasion. this indicates that the cytoplasmic tail is required for cd46 to promote invasion by gas. invasion assays with lactococcus lactis that express m protein demonstrated the dependence of cd46-promoted invasion on interaction with m protein. in addition,  cd46-mediated invasion was also found to be dependent on the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin.

AB  == the human papillomavirus type-16 (hpv-16) e7 protein is considered a major viral  oncoprotein involved in cervical cancer (cxca) and a potential candidate for the  development of a vaccine against this neoplasia. here, two lactic acid bacteria (the model one lactococcus lactis and a probiotic one lactobacillus plantarum) were engineered to deliver an e7 mutant protein (e7mm), which has a reduced transforming activity and consequently, could fit better to therapeutic use in humans than the native form of e7. an efficient cell-surface display of e7mm was  obtained in l. lactis using an expression cassette encoding a precursor composed  of (i) the signal peptide and the first 15 amino acids of the mature part of the  lactococcal usp45 protein; (ii) e7mm and (iii) the cell-wall anchor of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein (cwa(m6)). this hybrid precursor was produced but not cell-wall anchored in lb. plantarum. we thus replaced cwa(m6) by the cell-wall anchor of a lb. plantarum protein which allows an efficient cell-wall anchoring of e7mm in this bacterium. the e7mm production and cell-surface display in both l. lactis and a probiotic bacterium, lb. plantarum, represent one more step towards the development of a safe and effective treatment against cxca.

AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == comparative analysis of gene expression among low g+c gram-positive genomes.
AB  == we present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (phx) genes in the low g+c gram-positive genomes of bacillus subtilis, bacillus halodurans, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium acetobutylicum, and clostridium perfringens. most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are phx in these genomes, but not those involved in the tca cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. only b. subtilis and b. halodurans have several tca cycle phx genes, whereas the tca pathway is entirely  missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two streptococcus species and is incomplete in listeria, lactococcus, and clostridium. pyruvate-formate lyase, an  enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest phx genes in all these genomes except for c. acetobutylicum (not phx), and b. subtilis, and b. halodurans (missing). pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently phx in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. phosphotransferase system genes are generally phx with selection of different substrates in different genomes. the various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in  different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.

TI  == genomic organization and molecular characterization of sm1, a temperate bacteriophage of streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the direct binding of streptococcus mitis to human platelets is mediated in part  by two proteins (pbla and pblb) encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage (sm1). since sm1 is the first prophage of s. mitis that has been identified and because of the possible role of these phage-encoded proteins in virulence, we sought to characterize sm1 in greater detail. sequencing of the sm1 genome revealed that it consisted of 34,692 bp, with an overall g+c content of 39 mol%. fifty-six genes encoding proteins of 40 or more amino acids were identified. the genes of sm1 appear to be arranged in a modular, life cycle-specific organization. blast analysis also revealed that the proteins of sm1 have homologies to proteins from  a wide variety of lambdoid phages. bioinformatic analyses, in addition to n-terminal sequencing of the proteins, led to the assignment of possible functions to a number of proteins, including the integrase, the terminase, and two major structural proteins. examination of the phage structural components indicates that the phage head may assemble using stable multimers of the major capsid protein, in a process similar to that of phage r1t. these findings indicate that sm1 may be part of a discrete subfamily of the siphoviridae that includes at least phages r1t of lactococcus lactis and sf370.3 of streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == m1 protein triggers a phosphoinositide cascade for group a streptococcus invasion of epithelial cells.
AB  == invasion of nonphagocytic cells by bacteria provides a favorable niche for persistence and evasion of host defenses and antibiotics. m protein is a major virulence factor because it promotes high-frequency invasion of epithelial cells  by group a streptococcus (gas) and also renders the bacterium resistant to phagocytosis. in this study, we investigated the role of m1 protein from serotype m1 strain 90-226 in regulating mammalian signal transduction and cytoskeletal rearrangement for bacterial entry. ly294002 and wortmannin, which are inhibitors  of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-k) blocked invasion of epithelial cells by gas by 75 and 80%, respectively, but failed to inhibit invasion by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. also, epithelial cells transiently transfected with dominant negative p85 and p110 genes, the regulatory and catalytic subunits of pi 3-k, respectively, were less able to be invaded by gas. to separate the influence of other streptococcal virulence factors from m protein, lactococcus lactis was engineered to express m1 protein on its surface. l. lactis(plm1) invaded epithelial cells efficiently in vitro, and pi 3-k inhibitors blocked 90% of this  invasion. purified soluble m1 protein stimulated the formation of stress fibers and actin tuffs on epithelial cells. ly294002 and wortmannin inhibited these cellular changes. a phosphoinositide analogue also inhibited the invasion of epithelial cells by gas. therefore, m1 protein, either directly or via bound fibronectin, initiates signals that depend on the lipid kinase pi 3-k pathway, which paves the way for cytoskeletal rearrangement that internalize the bacterium.

TI  == frequent oligonucleotide motifs in genomes of three streptococci.
AB  == complete genomes of three closely related gram-positive bacteria streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and lactococcus lactis are analyzed for abundances of short dna sequence motifs (frequent words). the character and extent of frequent words are strikingly different among these genomes. the frequent words of s.pneumoniae split into three categories: parts of the previously characterized rup and box repetitive elements and a 24 bp tandem repeat in the gene sp1772. the most abundant frequent words of l.lactis are all related to the 13 bp motif, wwnttactgacrr or its inverted complement yygtcagtaanww. distributional analysis of this motif, which we called highly repetitive motif (hrm), indicates its possible dual role. frequent occurrences immediately downstream of genes suggest a possible role in transcription termination whereas spacings of consecutive hrms consistent with the dna helical  period are indicative of a protein-binding site. two regions of the l.lactis genome feature an intriguing pattern of several periodically occurring hrms separated by precisely 59 bp. in a striking contrast to s.pneumoniae and l.lactis, s.pyogenes contains hardly any frequent words.

TI  == the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase motif is lacking in pmpa, the prsa-like protein involved in the secretion machinery of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the prsa-like gene from lactococcus lactis encoding its single homologue to prsa, an essential protein triggering the folding of secreted proteins in bacillus subtilis, was characterized. this gene, annotated pmpa, encodes a lipoprotein of  309 residues whose expression is increased 7- to 10-fold when the source of nitrogen is limited. a slight increase in the expression of the prsa-like protein (plp) in l. lactis removed the degradation products previously observed with the  staphylococcus hyicus lipase used as a model secreted protein. this shows that pmpa either triggers the folding of the secreted lipase or activates its degradation by the cell surface protease htra. unlike the case for b. subtilis, the inactivation of the gene encoding pmpa reduced only slightly the growth rate  of l. lactis in standard conditions. however, it almost stopped its growth when the lipase was overexpressed in the presence of salt in the medium. like prsa of  b. subtilis and prtm of l. lactis, the l. lactis pmpa protein could thus have a foldase activity that facilitates protein secretion. these proteins belong to the third family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (ppiases) for which parvulin is the prototype. almost all plp from gram-positive bacteria contain a domain with the ppiase signature. an exception to this situation was found only in streptococcaceae, the family to which l. lactis belongs. plp from streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis possess this signature, but those of l. lactis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus mutans do not. however, secondary structure predictions suggest that the folding of plp is conserved over the entire length of the proteins, including the unconserved signature region. the activity associated with the expression of pmpa in l. lactis and these genomic data show that either the ppiase motif is not necessary for ppiase activity or, more likely, pmpa foldase activity does not necessarily require ppiase activity.

AB  == brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacterial pathogen  that infects humans and animals by entry mainly through the digestive tract. b. abortus causes abortion in pregnant cattle and undulant fever in humans. the immunogenic b. abortus ribosomal protein l7/l12 is a promising candidate antigen  for the development of oral live vaccines against brucellosis, using food-grade lactic acid bacteria (lab) as a carrier. the l7/l12 gene was expressed in lactococcus lactis, the model lab, under the nisin-inducible promoter. using different signals, l7/l12 was produced in cytoplasmic, cell-wall-anchored, and secreted forms. cytoplasmic production of l7/l12 gave a low yield, estimated at 0.5 mg/liter. interestingly, a secretable form of this normally cytoplasmic protein via fusion with a signal peptide resulted in increased yield of l7/l12 to 3 mg/liter; secretion efficiency (se) was 35%. a fusion between the mature moiety of the staphylococcal nuclease (nuc) and l7/l12 further increased yield to 8 mg/liter. fusion with a synthetic propeptide (leisstcda) previously described as  an enhancer for heterologous protein secretion in l. lactis (y. le loir, a. gruss, s. d. ehrlich, and p. langella, j. bacteriol. 180:1895-1903, 1998) raised  the yield to 8 mg/liter and se to 50%. a surface-anchored l7/l12 form in l. lactis was obtained by fusing the cell wall anchor of streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein to the c-terminal end of l7/l12. the fusions described allow the production and targeting of l7/l12 in three different locations in l. lactis. this is the first example of a b. abortus antigen produced in a food-grade bacterium and opens new perspectives for alternative vaccine strategies against brucellosis.

AB  == streptococcus gordonii is a primary etiological agent in the development of subacute bacterial endocarditis (sbe), producing thrombus formation and tissue damage on the surfaces of heart valves. this is ironic, considering its normal role as a benign inhabitant of the oral microflora. however, strain fss2 of s. gordonii has been found to produce several extracellular aminopeptidase- and fibrinogen-degrading activities during growth in a ph-controlled batch culture. in this report, we describe the purification, characterization, and partial cloning of a predicted serine class arginine aminopeptidase (rap) with some cysteine class characteristics. isolation of this enzyme by anion-exchange, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing chromatography yielded a protein monomer of  approximately 70 kda, as shown by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. nested-pcr cloning enabled the isolation of a 324-bp-long dna fragment encoding the 108-amino-acid n terminus of rap. culture activity profiles and n-terminal sequence analysis indicated the export of this protein from the cell surface. homology was found with a putative dipeptidase from streptococcus pyogenes and nonspecific dipeptidases from lactobacillus helveticus and lactococcus lactis. we believe that rap may serve as a critical factor for arginine acquisition during nutrient stress in vivo and also in the proteolysis of host proteins and peptides during sbe pathology.

AB  == entry of serotype m1 streptococcus pyogenes into host cells depends on binding of the host glycoprotein fibronectin (fn) by the bacterial m1 protein. the present study was undertaken to localize the fn binding region in m1 and assess other potential functions of m1. a set of recombinant m1 protein fragments were assayed for their capacities to bind fn and inhibit ingestion of streptococci by epithelial cells. m1 protein, m6 protein and internally-deleted derivatives of m1 were expressed on the surface of lactococcus lactis. lactococci that expressed m1 or m6 protein bound fn and were efficiently taken up by epithelial cells. deletion of both the n-terminal a and b repeats regions of m1 abrogated fn binding and intracellular invasion. deletion of either the a domain (m1deltaa) or b repeats (m1deltab) significantly reduced, but did not completely eliminate, fn  binding indicating that m1 protein may possess two independent fn binding sites.  fn binding by the m1deltaa or m1deltab proteins was insufficient for efficient invasion, however, suggesting that m protein binding alters the structure of fn that, in turn, affects the interaction between fn and epithelial cells. although  expression of m1, m6 or m1deltab proteins led to aggregation of lactococcal cells, aggregation did not significantly contribute to invasion efficiency.

TI  == comparative genomics reveals close genetic relationships between phages from dairy bacteria and pathogenic streptococci: evolutionary implications for prophage-host interactions.
AB  == the genome of the highly pathogenic m1 serotype streptococcus pyogenes isolate sf370 contains eight prophage elements. only prophage sf370.1 could be induced by mitomycin c treatment. prophage sf370.3 showed a 33.5-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of the cos-site temperate siphovirus r1t infecting the dairy bacterium lactococcus lactis. the two-phage genomes shared between 60 and 70% nucleotide sequence identity over the dna packaging, head and  tail genes. analysis of the sf370.3 genome revealed mutations in the replisome organizer gene that may prevent the induction of the prophage. the mutated phage  replication gene was closely related to a virulence marker identified in recently emerged m3 serotype s. pyogenes strains in japan. this observation suggests that  prophage genes confer selective advantage to the lysogenic host. sf370.3 encodes  a hyaluronidase and a dnase that may facilitate the spreading of s. pyogenes through tissue planes of its human host. prophage sf370.2 showed a 43-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of pac-site temperate siphoviridae infecting the dairy bacteria s. thermophilus and l. lactis. over part of the structural genes, the similarity between sf370.2 and s. thermophilus  phage o1205 extended to the nucleotide sequence level. sf370.2 showed two probable inactivating mutations: one in the replisome organizer gene and another  in the gene encoding the portal protein. prophage sf370.2 also encodes a hyaluronidase and in addition two very likely virulence factors: prophage-encoded toxins acting as superantigens that may contribute to the immune deregulation observed during invasive streptococcal infections. the superantigens are encoded  between the phage lysin and the right attachment site of the prophage genome. the genes were nearly sequence identical with a dna segment in s. equi, suggesting horizontal gene transfer. the trend for prophage genome inactivation was even more evident for the remaining five prophage sequences that showed massive losses of prophage dna. in these prophage remnants only 13-0.3 kb of putative prophage dna was detected. we discuss the genomics data from s. pyogenes strain sf370 within the framework of darwinian coevolution of prophages and lysogenic bacteria and suggest elements of genetic cooperation and elements of an arms race in this  host-parasite relationship.

AB  == fibronectin binding domain was expressed on the cell surface of lactobacillus casei strain shirota which hardly adheres to fibronectin. dna for the fibronectin binding domain of the sfbl gene, which encodes a fibronectin binding protein of streptococcus pyogenes atcc 21059, was amplified with polymerase chain reaction,  cloned into a surface display vector psak332, and introduced into l. casei. the fibronectin binding domain was expressed as a fusion protein consisting of staphylokinase of staphylococcus aureus and the anchor sequence of cell wall-associated 763 proteinase of lactococcus lactis ncdo 763. the fibronectin binding ability of the resulting l. casei was confirmed with western blot analysis, immunoelectron microscopic analysis, and adherence to fibroblast cells. these results indicate that l. casei has acquired a new phenotype to bind fibronectin upon the expression of the fibronectin binding domain on the cell surface. this l. casei also shows binding affinity to fibrinogen, indicating that fibronectin binding domain is involved in the binding to fibrinogen as well.

TI  == studies on the genomic organization of recombinant streptococcus gordonii and the development of a novel intergenic integration site for foreign gene expression.
AB  == the methods currently employed to produce recombinant streptococcus gordonii strains for use as vaccines and/or protein expression vectors result in the insertion of foreign genes into an unknown integration site with no information on the transcriptional context or potential phenotypic consequences. therefore, the genomic organization surrounding the insertion site of a recombinant strain of s. gordonii (gp1223) containing a portion of the emm6 gene of streptococcus pyogenes was determined. the nucleotide sequence of chromosomal walks in both directions from the insertion site revealed that the insert was flanked by a duplicated 3061-bp clai fragment. a consensus gram-positive promoter and a factor-independent rna polymerase terminator sequence could be deduced in the fragment immediately upstream of the insertion site. the clai fragment also encoded open reading frames (orfs) with high homology and parallel structural organization to the leucine biosynthesis operon of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. chromosomal walks downstream of the identified promoter region on the non-recombinant parental strain, gp204, yielded the sequence of two orfs which would be normal targets of the transcription derived from this promoter. northern analyses detected a highly expressed m6-specific transcript in recombinant strain gp1223 consistent in size with the proposed transcription unit. transcripts analogous in length to those observed for the leucine biosynthesis operon of l. lactis subsp. lactis were also detected encompassing the homologous orfs of s. gordonii. this information has enabled the construction of a recombinant s. gordonii strain in which the emm6 gene from s. pyogenes was targeted to a distinct intergenic locus within the s. gordonii genome. this new recombination site allows for expression of foreign gene products with minimal perturbation of  the genomic organization of the wild-type s. gordonii strain and has provided information essential for further optimization of foreign gene expression levels.

TI  == design of a protein-targeting system for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == we designed an expression and export system that enabled the targeting of a reporter protein (the staphylococcal nuclease nuc) to specific locations in lactococcus lactis cells, i.e., cytoplasm, cell wall, or medium. optimization of  protein secretion and of protein cell wall anchoring was performed with l. lactis cells by modifying the signals located at the n and c termini, respectively, of the reporter protein. efficient translocation of precursor (approximately 95%) is obtained using the signal peptide from the lactococcal usp45 protein and provided that the mature protein is fused to overall anionic amino acids at its n terminus; those residues prevented interactions of nuc with the cell envelope. nuc could be covalently anchored to the peptidoglycan by using the cell wall anchor motif of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein. however, the anchoring step proved to not be totally efficient in l. lactis, as considerable amounts of  protein remained membrane associated. our results may suggest that the defect is  due to limiting sortase in the cell. the optimized expression and export vectors  also allowed secretion and cell wall anchoring of nuc in food-fermenting and commensal strains of lactobacillus. in all strains tested, both secreted and cell wall-anchored nuc was enzymatically active, suggesting proper enzyme folding in the different locations. these results provide the first report of a targeting system in lactic acid bacteria in which the final location of a protein is controlled and biological activity is maintained.

TI  == characterization of opua, a glycine-betaine uptake system of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a lactococcus lactis glycine-betaine transport system was identified by functional complementation of an escherichia coli prop prou mutant with a gene library from l. lactis sbsp. cremoris. the cloned locus forms an operon highly homologous to opua, encoding a glycine-betaine uptake system of bacillus subtilis. disruption of opua in l. lactis abolished protection by glycine-betaine against elevated osmolarity. opua belongs to the so-called "abc transporters" family, which comprise an extracellularly localized substrate-binding protein. in b. subtilis opua system, this binding protein is a lipoprotein, attached to the external face of the cytoplasmic membrane by its lipidic moiety. in contrast, in  the l. lactis opua operon, and in other gram-positive homologues as well, a fusion between the gene encoding the integral membrane protein and the substrate-binding protein components gave rise to a hybrid protein presumably attaching the substrate-binding protein to the surface of the cell via its covalent link to the integral membrane component. mapping of l. lactis opua transcription start identified one mrna, more abundant in cells grown at elevated osmolarity. construction of an opua-gusa fusion confirmed that opua transcription is directed by a promoter osmotically inducible in l. lactis. when recombined upstream from a lac transcriptional fusion in the chromosome of e. coli, the opua promoter appeared as very strong, and only poorly stimulated by elevated osmotic  pressure, suggesting the existence of a specific machinery involved in the osmotic signal transduction in l. lactis.

TI  == genetic locus for streptolysin s production by group a streptococcus.
AB  == group a streptococcus (gas) is an important human pathogen that causes pharyngitis and invasive infections, including necrotizing fasciitis. streptolysin s (sls) is the cytolytic factor that creates the zone of beta-hemolysis surrounding gas colonies grown on blood agar. we recently reported the discovery of a potential genetic determinant involved in sls production, saga, encoding a small peptide of 53 amino acids (s. d. betschel, s. m. borgia, n. l. barg, d. e. low, and j. c. de azavedo, infect. immun. 66:1671-1679, 1998).  using transposon mutagenesis, chromosomal walking steps, and data from the gas genome sequencing project (www.genome.ou.edu/strep. html), we have now identified a contiguous nine-gene locus (saga to sagi) involved in sls production. the sag locus is conserved among gas strains regardless of m protein type. targeted plasmid integrational mutagenesis of each gene in the sag operon resulted in an sls-negative phenotype. targeted integrations (i) upstream of the saga promoter and (ii) downstream of a terminator sequence after sagi did not affect sls production, establishing the functional boundaries of the operon. a rho-independent terminator sequence between saga and sagb appears to regulate the amount of saga transcript produced versus transcript for the entire operon. reintroduction of the nine-gene sag locus on a plasmid vector restored sls activity to the nonhemolytic saga knockout mutant. finally, heterologous expression of the intact sag operon conferred the sls beta-hemolytic phenotype to the nonhemolytic lactococcus lactis. we conclude that gene products of the gas sag operon are both necessary and sufficient for sls production. sequence homologies of sag operon gene products suggest that sls is related to the bacteriocin family of microbial toxins.

TI  == group b streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. to identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from a549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. these plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled gbs as a probe. gbs adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kda (p50) and 57 kda (p57). we concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (ck8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of ck8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with ck8 after separation by two-dimensional page; (iii) ck8 in solution bound to gbs, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from a549 lysates that bound to gbs in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled gbs bound to a549 lysate-derived ck8 that had been captured in anti-ck8-coated microtiter wells. ck8 bound to coh1-13, an acapsular mutant of coh1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. trypsin-treated gbs did not bind to ck8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of gbs. soluble ck8 bound to six of six gbs strains  tested. soluble ck8 also bound to staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. we hypothesize that adherence  of gbs to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.

TI  == cold shock proteins and low-temperature response of streptococcus thermophilus cnrz302.
AB  == low-temperature adaptation and cryoprotection were studied in the thermophilic lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus cnrz302. s. thermophilus actively adapts to freezing during a pretreatment at 20 degrees c, resulting in an approximately 1, 000-fold increased survival after four freeze-thaw cycles compared to mid-exponential-phase cells grown at an optimal temperature of 42 degrees c. no adaptation is observed when cells are exposed to a temperature (10  degrees c) below the minimal growth temperature of the strain (just below 15 degrees c). by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis several 7-kda cold-induced proteins were identified, which are the major induced proteins after a shift to 20 degrees c. these cold shock proteins were maximally expressed at 20 degrees c, while the induction level was low after cold shock to 10 degrees c. to confirm the presence of csp genes in s. thermophilus, a pcr strategy was used which yielded products of different sizes. sequence analysis revealed csp-like sequences that were up to 95% identical to those of csp genes of s. thermophilus  st1-1, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactococcus lactis. northern blot analysis revealed a seven- to ninefold induction of csp mrna after a temperature shift to 20 degrees c, showing that this thermophilic bacterium indeed contains at least one cold-inducible csp gene and that its regulation takes place at the transcriptional level.

AB  == streptococcin a-ff22 (sa-ff22) is a type aii linear lantibiotic produced by streptococcus pyogenes strain ff22. sequence analysis of an approximate 10 kb region of dna showed it to contain nine open reading frames arranged in three operons responsible for regulation, biosynthesis and immunity of sa-ff22. this region is organized similarly to the lactococcus lactis lacticin 481 region, however, unlike lacticin 481, a two-component regulatory system is essential for  sa-ff22 production. located immediately downstream of the scn region is a putative transposase gene, the presence of which supports earlier data that indicated a mobile nature to this region.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == we characterized the regulated activity of the lactococcal nisa promoter in strains of the gram-positive species streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and bacillus subtilis. nisa promoter activity was dependent on the proteins nisr and nisk, which constitute a two-component signal transduction system that responds to the  extracellular inducer nisin. the nisin sensitivity and inducer concentration required for maximal induction varied among the strains. significant induction of the nisa promoter (10- to 60-fold induction) was obtained in all of the species studied at a nisin concentration just below the concentration at which growth is  inhibited. the efficiency of the nisa promoter was compared to the efficiencies of the spac, xyla, and laca promoters in b. subtilis and in s. pyogenes. because  nisa promoter-driven expression is regulated in many gram-positive bacteria, we expect it to be useful for genetic studies, especially studies with pathogenic streptococci in which no other regulated promoters have been described.

AB  == a novel insertion sequence, is1194, has been identified in the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368. this 1200-bp element has 16-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the single large open reading frame of this  element encodes a 332-amino-acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is5 group  of the is4 family. a single copy of is1194 was detected by hybridization in only  2 of the 19 s. thermophilus strains tested and in 4 of the 13 lactococcus lactis  strains investigated. this suggests that this is element was acquired by horizontal transfer. the unique is1194 copy of s. thermophilus cnrz368 is located in a region of at least 12 kb that was probably acquired by horizontal transfer from l. lactis. furthermore, the is1194 right end is identical to sequences found in a broad-host-range conjugative plasmid from streptococcus pyogenes, psm19035.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == a host factor absent from lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis mg1363 is required for conjugative transposition.
AB  == in matings between lactococcus lactis strains, the conjugative transposons tn916  and tn919 are found in the chromosome of the transconjugants in the same place as in the chromosome of the donor, indicating that no transposition has occurred. in agreement with this, the frequency of l. lactis transconjugants from intraspecies matings is the same whether the donor contains the wild-type form of the transposon or the mutant tn916-int1, which has an insertion in the transposon's integrase gene. however, in intergeneric crosses with bacillus subtilis or enterococcus faecalis donors, tn916 and tn919 transpose to different locations on the chromosome of the l. lactis transconjugants. moreover, tn916 and tn919 could  not be transferred by conjugation from l. lactis and b. subtilis, e. faecalis or  streptococcus pyogenes. this suggests that excision of these elements does not occur in l. lactis. when cloned into e. coli with adjacent chromosomal dna from l. lactis, the conjugative transposons were able to excise, transpose and promote conjugation. therefore, the inability of these elements to excise in l. lactis is not caused by a permanent structural alteration in the transposon. we conclude that l. lactis lacks a factor required for excision of conjugative transposons.

AB  == hot saline extracts of streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. chromatography of the extract of s. mutans strain mt703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 column gave two principal antigens. one antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. the other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. it was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (pgp) from group a streptococcus pyogenes and/or s. mutans strain ingbritt (type  c). the pgp antigen was further purified by gel filtration with sephadex g-75. two peaks, pgp-1, and pgp-2, were obtained. each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-pgp serum as shown by immunodiffusion. chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. pgp antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. however, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of pgp. the pgp in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity.  the addition of diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting pgp antigen. after adsorption of the extract from s. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and pgp antigens were absorbed with the resin. this simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the pgp-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.

TI  == herd incidence of bovine mastitis in four danish dairy. districts ii. evaluation  of the effect of the mastitis control scheme.
AB  == bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four danish dairy districts. after a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. the rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to  12% on a quarter basis. a comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has  taken place during that period. in particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of group b, c, g, and l streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of staphylococcus aureus. a comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 english herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower  level of infection was reached than in the 399 danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. the annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at d.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of d.kr. 42 million on account of the danish mastitis control. the total annual expenditure on danish mastitis control is estimated at d.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million d.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on  drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.
