TI  == serious bacterial infections after endoscopic procedures.
AB  == transient bacteremia during and after endoscopic procedures is a well- documented phenomenon, but complicated bacteremia such as endocarditis in patients at risk is considered to be extremely rare. the recommendations for prophylaxis before endoscopy in patients with valvular heart disease were recently released. we discuss 16 cases of complicated bacteremia that developed after endoscopy (eight  cases previously published in the literature and eight cases we encountered). the endoscopic procedures were gastroscopy (five cases), sclerotherapy (six cases), sigmoidoscopy (three cases), and esophageal dilation (two cases). fourteen patients had underlying disease: valvular heart disease (six patients), cirrhosis of the liver (five patients, one of whom also had a prosthetic knee), valvular heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver (two patients), and gastric carcinoma (one patient). the organisms involved were streptococcus viridans (six cases), streptococcus group d (three cases), streptococcus pneumoniae (two cases), streptococcus microaerophilicus (two cases), staphylococcus aureus (two cases), and cardiobacterium hominis (one case). the patients presented with the following infections: endocarditis (12 patients), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (two patients), septic arthritis (one patient), and brain abscess (one patient). the outcome was good in 15 patients; one patient died. patients with valvular heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver, ascites, malignancies, or prosthetic joints who  undergo endoscopic procedures should be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis.

TI  == the use of beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of septicaemia and endocarditis.
AB  == despite the availability of numerous beta-lactam antibiotics, benzylpenicillin remains the most important beta-lactam antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. penicillin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside is effective in the treatment of endocarditis due to all streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus aprophilus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, listeria monocytogenes. oral phenoxymethylpenicillin in combination with streptomycin is effective in treating endocarditis due to viridans streptococci. ampicillin is effective in endocarditis due to haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, h. paraphrophilus, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli. oral amoxicillin with gentamicin has been used to treat enterococcal endocarditis. the penicillinase-resistant penicillins are effective in treating s. aureus endocarditis. carbenicillin or ticarcillin in combination with tobramycin or gentamicin are used to treat endocarditis due to serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the use of piperacillin in combination with tobramycin against p. aeruginosa endocarditis has been associated with failure and increased resistance. the cephalosporins have been used to treat endocarditis caused by susceptible organisms. there have been few data on the efficacy of the newer cephalosporins in treating endocarditis. they have been used to treat septicaemia due to susceptible organisms with good results.
