TI  == genome-wide analysis of the pho regulon in a pstca mutant of citrobacter rodentium.
AB  == the phosphate-specific transport operon, pstscab-phou, of gram-negative bacteria  is an essential part of the pho regulon. its key roles are to encode a high-affinity inorganic phosphate transport system and to prevent activation of phob in phosphate-rich environments. in general, mutations in pstscab-phou lead to the constitutive expression of the pho regulon. previously, we constructed a pstca deletion mutant of citrobacter rodentium and found it to be attenuated for  virulence in mice, its natural host. this attenuation was dependent on phob or phob-regulated gene(s) because a phob mutation restored virulence for mice to the pstca mutant. to investigate how downstream genes may contribute to the virulence of c. rodentium, we used microarray analysis to investigate global gene expression of c. rodentium strain icc169 and its isogenic pstca mutant when grown in phosphate-rich medium. overall 323 genes of the pstca mutant were differentially expressed by at least 1.5-fold compared to the wild-type c. rodentium. of these 145 were up-regulated and 178 were down-regulated. differentially expressed genes included some involved in phosphate homoeostasis,  cellular metabolism and protein metabolism. a large number of genes involved in stress responses and of unknown function were also differentially expressed, as were some virulence-associated genes. up-regulated virulence-associated genes in  the pstca mutant included that for degp, a serine protease, which appeared to be  directly regulated by phob. down-regulated genes included those for the production of the urease, flagella, nleg8 (a type iii-secreted protein) and the tad focus (which encodes type ivb pili in yersinia enterocolitica). infection studies using c57/bl6 mice showed that degp and nleg8 play a role in bacterial virulence. overall, our study provides evidence that pho is a global regulator of gene expression in c. rodentium and indicates the presence of at least two previously unrecognized virulence determinants of c. rodentium, namely, degp and  nleg8.

TI  == modulation of connexin signaling by bacterial pathogens and their toxins.
AB  == inherent to their pivotal tasks in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, gap junctions, connexin hemichannels, and pannexin hemichannels are frequently involved in the dysregulation of this critical balance. the present paper specifically focuses on their roles in bacterial infection and disease. in particular, the reported biological outcome of clinically important bacteria including escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, helicobacter pylori, bordetella pertussis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter rodentium, clostridium species, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus and their toxic products on connexin- and pannexin-related signaling in host cells is reviewed. particular attention is paid to the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects as well as to the actual biological relevance of these findings.

TI  == resistance of chemokine receptor 6-deficient mice to yersinia enterocolitica infection: evidence of defective m-cell formation in vivo.
AB  == m cells, specialized cells within peyer's patches (pps), are reduced in number in chemokine receptor 6 (ccr6)-deficient mice. the pathogenic microorganism yersinia enterocolitica exploits m cells for the purpose of mucosal tissue invasion exclusively through pps. the aim of this study was to evaluate the course of yersiniosis in ccr6-deficient mice and to investigate whether these mice might be used as an in vivo model to determine m-cell function. after oral challenge with  y. enterocolitica, control mice suffered from lethal septic infection whereas ccr6-deficient mice showed very limited symptoms of infection. immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated pp invasion by y. enterocolitica in control mice whereas no bacteria could be found in ccr6-deficient mice. in addition, a significant induction of proinflammatory cytokines could be found in  control mice whereas proinflammatory cytokine levels in ccr6-deficient mice remained unchanged. in contrast, intraperitoneal infection resulted in severe systemic yersiniosis in both mouse groups. abrogated oral y. enterocolitica infection in ccr6-deficient mice demonstrates the importance of ccr6 expression in the physiological and pathological immune responses generated within pps by influencing m-cell differentiation, underscoring the important role of m cells in the process of microbial uptake. ccr6-deficient mice may therefore represent a suitable model for the study of m-cell function in vivo.

TI  == influence of gastric acid on susceptibility to infection with ingested bacterial  pathogens.
AB  == despite the widely held belief that gastric acid serves as a barrier to bacterial pathogens, there are almost no experimental data to support this hypothesis. we have developed a mouse model to quantify the effectiveness of gastric acid in mediating resistance to infection with ingested bacteria. mice that were constitutively hypochlorhydric due to a mutation in a gastric h(+)/k(+)-atpase (proton pump) gene were infected with yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, citrobacter rodentium, or clostridium perfringens cells or spores. significantly greater numbers of yersinia, salmonella, and citrobacter cells (p < or = 0.006) and clostridium spores (p = 0.02) survived in  hypochlorhydric mice, resulting in reduced median infectious doses. experiments involving intraperitoneal infection or infection of mice treated with antacids indicated that the increased sensitivity of hypochlorhydric mice to infection was entirely due to the absence of stomach acid. apart from establishing the role of  gastric acid in nonspecific immunity to ingested bacterial pathogens, our model provides an excellent system with which to investigate the effects of hypochlorhydria on susceptibility to infection and to evaluate the in vivo susceptibility to gastric acid of orally administered therapies, such as vaccines and probiotics.
