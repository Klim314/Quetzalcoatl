TI  - Vaccination against Staphylococcus aureus experimental endocarditis using recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing ClfA or FnbpA.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of serious infections in humans and animals and a vaccine is becoming a necessity. Lactococcus lactis is a non-pathogenic bacterium that can be used as a vector for the delivery of antigens. We investigated the ability of non-living L. lactis heterologously expressing S. aureus clumping factor A (ClfA) and fibronectin-binding protein A (FnbpA), alone or together, to elicit an immune response in rats and protect them from S. aureus experimental infective endocarditis (IE). L. lactis ClfA was used for immunization against S. aureus Newman (expressing ClfA but not FnbpA), while L. lactis ClfA, L. lactis FnbpA, as well as L. lactis ClfA/FnbpA, were used against S. aureus P8 (expressing ClfA and FnbpA). Vaccination of rats with L. lactis ClfA elicited antibodies that inhibited binding of S. aureus Newman to fibrinogen, triggered the production of IL-17A and conferred protection to 13/19 (68%) of the animals from IE (P<0.05). Immunization with L. lactis ClfA, L. lactis FnbpA or L. lactis ClfA/FnbpA also produced antibodies against the target proteins, but these did not prevent binding of S. aureus P8 to fibrinogen or fibronectin and did not protect animals against S. aureus P8 IE. Moreover, immunization with constructs containing FnbpA did not increase IL-17A production. These results indicate that L. lactis is a valuable antigen delivery system able to elicit efficient humoral and cellular responses. However, the most appropriate antigens affording protection against S. aureus IE are yet to be elucidated.
TI  - The Impact of Cell-Free Supernatant of Lactic Acid Bacteria on Putrescine and other Polyamine Formation by Food-Borne-Pathogens in Ornithine Decarboxylase Broth.
AB  - Conversion of ornithine to putrescine by Salmonella Paratyphi A, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were investigated in ornithine decarboxylase broth (ODB) using cell free supernatants (CFSs) obtained from Leuconostoc mesenterodies subsp. cremoris, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus. Two groups of cell-free supernatants (25% or 50%) and control (only ODB) were prepared in order to investigate putrescine (PUT) and other polyamine formation by food-borne pathogens (FBPs). Significant differences (p<0.05) were observed among the species for each amine. All the CFSs reduced the formation of PUT by 65% or more. The production of cadaverine (CAD) was scarcely affected by the presence of CFSs, with the exception of the samples inoculated with L. monocytogenes. The variation in polyamine was found with respect to the control samples. Spermidine (SPD) was produced in lower amount in many samples, especially in Gram negative FBPs, while spermine (SPN) increased drastically in the major part of the samples concerning to the control. Histamine (HIS) was characterized by a marked concentration decrease in all the samples and tyramine (TYR) was accumulated in very low concentrations in the controls. Therefore, the ability of bacteria to produce certain biogenic amines such as HIS, TYR, PUT and CAD has been studied in order to assess their risk and prevent their formation in food products. The results obtained from this study concluded that the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains with non-decarboxylase activity are capable of avoiding or limiting biogenic amines formation by FBP.
TI  - Proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  - We examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of LB Bulgaricum PLC for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grown in goat milk. The aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by LAB, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. Whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. The proteolytic activity of Lactococcus lactis l598, Streptococcus thermophilus t3D1, Dt1, Lactobacillus lactis 1043 and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. The proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. Most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella cholere enteridis, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua and Enterobacter aerogenes. The most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. The starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. The greatest antimicrobial activity of the cultures was detected against E. aerogenes. The obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. The present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of LB Bulgaricum PLC.
TI  - Incorporation of nisin Z and lauric arginate into pullulan films to inhibit foodborne pathogens associated with fresh and ready-to-eat muscle foods.
AB  - A combination of food grade compounds with edible films, used to inhibit foodborne pathogens associated with fresh or further processed muscle foods, is receiving considerable attention. In this study, pullulan films containing lauric arginate (LAE) and nisin Z (produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis I8-7-3 and isolated from catfish gut), alone or in combination, were investigated for controlling foodborne pathogens on fresh and further processed muscle foods after long-term refrigerated storage. Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis on raw turkey breast slices wrapped with a film containing LAE or the combination of LAE with nisin Z were reduced throughout the experiment, 2.5 to 4.5log10CFU/cm(2) and 3.5 to 5.1log10CFU/cm(2), respectively. Film containing a combination of LAE with nisin Z reduced Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes Scott A inoculated onto ham surfaces by approximately 5.53 and 5.62log10CFU/cm(2), respectively during refrigerated storage. Escherichia coli O157:H7, O111, and O26 also were reduced by >4log10CFU/cm(2) on raw beef slices after treatment with the combination film and refrigerated storage. The results obtained from this study indicate the LAE- and LAE-nisin Z-containing pullulan films displayed excellent inhibition against foodborne pathogens on fresh and further processed muscle foods.
TI  - Active immunization with an octa-valent Staphylococcus aureus antigen mixture in  models of S. aureus bacteremia and skin infection in mice.
AB  - Proteomic studies with different Staphylococcus aureus isolates have shown that the cell surface-exposed and secreted proteins IsaA, LytM, Nuc, the propeptide of Atl (pro-Atl) and four phenol-soluble modulins alpha (PSMalpha) are invariantly produced by this pathogen. Therefore the present study was aimed at investigating whether these proteins can be used for active immunization against S. aureus infection in mouse models of bacteremia and skin infection. To this end, recombinant His-tagged fusions of IsaA, LytM, Nuc and pro-Atl were isolated from Lactococcus lactis or Escherichia coli, while the PSMalpha1-4 peptides were chemically synthesized. Importantly, patients colonized by S. aureus showed significant immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses against all eight antigens. BALB/cBYJ mice were immunized subcutaneously with a mixture of the antigens at day one (5 mug each), and boosted twice (25 mug of each antigen) with 28 days interval. This resulted in high IgG responses against all antigens although the response against pro-Atl was around one log lower compared to the other antigens. Compared to placebo-immunized mice, immunization with the octa-valent antigen mixture did not reduce the S. aureus isolate P load in blood, lungs, spleen, liver, and kidneys in a bacteremia model in which the animals were challenged for 14 days with a primary load of 3 x 10(5) CFU. Discomfort scores and animal survival rates over 14 days did not differ between immunized mice and placebo-immunized mice upon bacteremia with S. aureus USA300 (6 x 10(5) CFU). In addition, this immunization did not reduce the S. aureus isolate P load in mice with skin infection. These results show that the target antigens are immunogenic in both humans and mice, but in the used animal models do not result in protection against S. aureus infection.
TI  - The influence of the cell free solution of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food borne-pathogens in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The function of cell-free solutions (CFSs) of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (FBPs) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) using HPLC. Cell free solutions were prepared from four LAB strains. Two different concentrations which were 50% (5 ml CFS+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml CFS+7.5 ml medium/1:3) CFS and the control without CFS were prepared. Both concentration of CFS of Streptococcus thermophilus and 50% CFS of Pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by Salmonella paratyphi A. Tyramine production by Escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% CFS of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% CFS of Leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. The inhibitor effect of 50% CFS of P. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by Listeria monocytogenes, following Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% CFS of Leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). The stimulation effects of 50% CFS of S. thermophilus and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by Staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. CFS of LAB strains showed statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased pH quickly and reduced the formation of AMN and BAs. Consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use CFS for food and food products.
TI  - Optimization of fluorescent tools for cell biology studies in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The understanding of how Gram-positive bacteria divide and ensure the correct localization of different molecular machineries, such as those involved in the synthesis of the bacterial cell surface, is crucial to design strategies to fight bacterial infections. In order to determine the correct subcellular localization of fluorescent proteins in Streptococcus pneumoniae, we have previously described tools to express derivatives of four fluorescent proteins, mCherry, Citrine, CFP and GFP, to levels that allow visualization by fluorescence microscopy, by fusing the first ten amino acids of the S. pneumoniae protein Wze (the i-tag), upstream of the fluorescent protein. Here, we report that these tools can also be used in other Gram-positive bacteria, namely Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, possibly due to optimized translation rates. Additionally, we have optimized the i-tag by testing the effect of the first ten amino acids of other pneumococcal proteins in the increased expression of the fluorescent protein Citrine. We found that manipulating the structure and stability of the 5' end of the mRNA molecule, which may influence the accessibility of the ribosome, is determinant to ensure the expression of a strong fluorescent signal.
TI  - Behavior of Staphylococcus aureus in culture broth, in raw and thermized milk, and during processing and storage of traditional Greek Graviera cheese in the presence or absence of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris M104, a wild, novel nisin A-producing raw milk isolate.
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the behavior of Staphylococcus aureus during processing, ripening, and storage of traditional Greek Graviera cheese in accordance with European Union Regulation 1441/2007 for coagulase-positive staphylococci in thermized milk cheeses. Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris M104, a wild, novel nisin A-producing (NisA+) strain, also was evaluated as an antistaphylococcal adjunct. A three-strain cocktail of enterotoxigenic (Ent+) S. aureus increased by approximately 2 log CFU/ml when co-inoculated (at approximately 3 log CFU/ml) in thermized Graviera cheese milk (TGCM; 63 degrees C for 30 s) with commercial starter culture (CSC) and/or strain M104 at approximately 6 log CFU/ml and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 3 h. However, after 6 h at 37 degrees C, significant retarding effects on S. aureus growth were noted in the order TGCM + M104 > TGCM + CSC = TGCM + CSC + M104 > TGCM. Additional incubation of TGCM cultures at 18 degrees C for 66 h resulted in a 1.2-log reduction (P < 0.05) of S. aureus populations in TGCM + M104. The Ent + S. aureus cocktail did not grow but survived during ripening and storage when inoculated (at approximately 3 log CFU/g) postcooking into Graviera mini cheeses prepared from TGCM + CSC or TGCM + CSC + M104, ripened at 18 degrees C and 90% relative humidity for 20 days, and stored at 4 degrees C in vacuum packages for 2 months. A rapid 10-fold decrease (P < 0.05) in S. aureus populations occurred within the first 24 h of cheese fermentation. Reductions of S. aureus were greater by approximately 0.4 log CFU/g in CSC + M104 than in CSC only cheeses, concomitantly with the presence of NisA + M104 colonies and nisin-encoding genes in the CSC plus M104 cheeses and their corresponding microbial consortia only. A high level of selective survival of a naturally nisin-resistant EntC z S. aureus strain from the cocktail was noted in CSC + M104 cheeses and in coculture with the NisA + M104 strain in M-17 broth. In conclusion, although S. aureus growth inhibition is assured during Graviera cheese ripening, early growth of the pathogen during milk curdling and curd cooking operations may occur. Nisin-resistant S. aureus strains that may contaminate Graviera cheese milks postthermally may be difficult to control even by the application of the NisA + L. lactis subsp. cremoris strain M104 as a bioprotective adjunct culture.
TI  - Correlation between fibronectin binding protein A expression level at the surface of recombinant lactococcus lactis and plasmid transfer in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibronectin Binding Protein A (FnBPA) is an invasin from Staphylococcus aureus that allows this pathogen to internalize into eukaryote cells. It was previously demonstrated that recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing FnBPA were invasive and able to transfer a plasmid to eukaryotic cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the invasivity of recombinant strains of Lactococcus lactis that express FnBPA under the control of its constitutive promoter or driven by the strong nisin inducible expression system (NICE) were studied. RESULTS: It was demonstrated that the nisA promoter allows an increase of FnBPA expression on the surface of Lactococcus lactis surface, as shown by flow cytometry, which subsequently enhanced internalization and plasmid transfer properties in vitro in Caco2 cells and Bone Marrow Dendritic Cells. In vivo, the use of nisA promoter increase the plasmid transfer in cells of both the small and large intestine of mice. CONCLUSION: FnBPA expression at the surface of recombinant L. lactis is positively correlated to internalization and DNA transfer properties. The recombinant strains of L. lactis that expresses FnBPA under the control of the nisin inducible expression system could thus be considered as an improved tool in the field of DNA transfer.
TI  - Contribution of Lactococcus lactis reducing properties to the downregulation of a major virulence regulator in Staphylococcus aureus, the agr system.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of food poisoning outbreaks associated with dairy products, because of the ingestion of preformed enterotoxins. The biocontrol of S. aureus using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) offers a promising opportunity to fight this pathogen while respecting the product ecosystem. We had previously established the ability of Lactococcus lactis, a lactic acid bacterium widely used in the dairy industry, to downregulate a major staphylococcal virulence regulator, the accessory gene regulator (agr) system, and, as a consequence, agr-controlled enterotoxins. In the present paper, we have shown that the oxygen-independent reducing properties of L. lactis contribute to agr downregulation. Neutralizing lactococcal reduction by adding potassium ferricyanide or maintaining the oxygen pressure constant at 50% released agr downregulation in the presence of L. lactis. This downregulation still occurred in an S. aureus srrA mutant, indicating that the staphylococcal respiratory response regulator SrrAB was not the only component in the signaling pathway. Therefore, this study clearly demonstrates the ability of L. lactis reducing properties to interfere with the expression of S. aureus virulence, thus highlighting this general property of LAB as a lever to control the virulence expression of this major pathogen in a food context and beyond.
TI  - Efficient production of secreted staphylococcal antigens in a non-lysing and proteolytically reduced Lactococcus lactis strain.
AB  - Cell surface-exposed and secreted proteins are attractive targets for vaccination against pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. To obtain sufficient amounts of such antigens, efficient protein production platforms are needed. In this study, a pipeline for the production and purification of surface-exposed and secreted antigens of the gram-positive bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is presented. Cytoplasmic or extracellular production of S. aureus antigens was achieved using the Lactococcus lactis strain PA1001, which lacks the major extracellular protease HtrA and the autolysin AcmA to minimize proteolysis and cell lysis, respectively. For most tested S. aureus antigens, secretory production directed by the signal peptide of the major secreted protein Usp45 of L. lactis resulted in higher yields than intracellular production without a signal peptide. Additionally, secretory production of His-tagged antigens allowed their facile one-step purification from the growth medium by metal affinity chromatography. For three of the purified antigens, biological activity was confirmed through enzyme activity assays. We, furthermore, show that the present pipeline can be used to produce staphylococcal antigens with an N-terminal AVI-tag for site-specific labeling with biotin or a C-terminal cell wall-binding domain for cell surface display. We conclude that our L. lactis-based pipeline allows the efficient production of S. aureus antigens and their subsequent purification in one step.
TI  - Probiotic assessment of Enterococcus durans 6HL and Lactococcus lactis 2HL isolated from vaginal microflora.
AB  - Forty-five lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from the vaginal specimens of healthy fertile women, and the identities of the bacteria were confirmed by sequencing of their 16S rDNA genes. Among these bacteria, only four isolates were able to resist and survive in low pH, bile salts and simulated in vitro digestion conditions. Lactococcus lactis 2HL, Enterococcus durans 6HL, Lactobacillus acidophilus 36YL and Lactobacillus plantarum 5BL showed the best resistance to these conditions. These strains were evaluated further to assess their ability to adhere to human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Lactococcus lactis 2HL and E. durans 6HL were the most adherent strains. In vitro tests under neutralized pH proved the antimicrobial activity of both strains. Results revealed that the growth of Escherichia coli O26, Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella flexneri was suppressed by both LAB strains. The antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that these strains were sensitive to all nine antibiotics: vancomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. These data suggest that E. durans 6HL and Lactococcus lactis 2HL could be examined further for their useful properties and could be developed as new probiotics.
TI  - Investigation of the Antimicrobial Activity of Bacillus licheniformis Strains Isolated from Retail Powdered Infant Milk Formulae.
AB  - This study investigated the potential antimicrobial activity of ten Bacillus licheniformis strains isolated from retail infant milk formulae against a range of indicator (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Listeria innocua) and clinically relevant (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli) microorganisms. Deferred antagonism assays confirmed that all B. licheniformis isolates show antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive target organisms. PCR and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses indicated that four of the B. licheniformis isolates produce the bacteriocin lichenicidin. The remaining six isolates demonstrated a higher antimicrobial potency than lichenicidin-producing strains. Further analyses identified a peptide of ~1,422 Da as the most likely bioactive responsible for the antibacterial activity of these six isolates. N-terminal sequencing of the ~1,422 Da peptide from one strain identified it as ILPEITXIFHD. This peptide shows a high homology to the non-ribosomal peptides bacitracin and subpeptin, known to be produced by Bacillus spp. Subsequent PCR analyses demonstrated that the six B. licheniformis isolates may harbor the genetic machinery needed for the synthesis of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase similar to those involved in production of subpeptin and bacitracin, which suggests that the ~1,422 Da peptide might be a variant of subpeptin and bacitracin.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - Immune response elicited by DNA vaccination using Lactococcus lactis is modified  by the production of surface exposed pathogenic protein.
AB  - In this study, we compared immune responses elicited by DNA immunization using Lactococcus lactis or L. lactis expressing the Staphylococcus aureus invasin Fibronectin Binding Protein A (FnBPA) at its surface. Both strains carried pValac:BLG, a plasmid containing the cDNA of Beta-Lactoglobulin (BLG), and were designated LL-BLG and LL-FnBPA+ BLG respectively. A TH2 immune response characterized by the secretion of IL-4 and IL-5 in medium of BLG reactivated splenocytes was detected after either oral or intranasal administration of LL-FnBPA+ BLG. In contrast, intranasal administration of LL-BLG elicited a TH1 immune response. After BLG sensitization, mice previously intranasally administered with LL-BLG showed a significantly lower concentration of BLG-specific IgE than the mice non-administered. Altenatively administration of LL-FnBPA+ BLG didn't modify the BLG-specific IgE concentration obtained after sensitization, thus confirming the TH2 orientation of the immune response. To determine if the TH2-skewed immune response obtained with LL-FnBpA+ BLG was FnBPA-specific or not, mice received another L. lactis strain producing a mutated form of the Listeria monocytogenes invasin Internalin A intranasally, allowing thus the binding to murine E-cadherin, and containing pValac:BLG (LL-mInlA+ BLG). As with LL-FnBPA+ BLG, LL-mInlA+ BLG was not able to elicit a TH1 immune response. Furthermore, we observed that these difference were not due to the peptidoglycan composition of the cell wall as LL-FnBPA+ BLG, LL-mInlA+ BLG and LL-BLG strains shared a similar composition. DNA vaccination using LL-BLG elicited a pro-inflammatory TH1 immune response while using LL-FnBPA+ BLG or LL-mInlA+ BLG elicited an anti-inflammatory TH2 immune response.
TI  - Recombinant protein expression in Lactococcus lactis using the P170 expression system.
AB  - The use of the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis in recombinant protein  production has several advantages, including the organism's long history of safe use in food production and the fact that it does not produce endotoxins. Furthermore the current non-dairy L. lactis production strains contain few proteases and can secrete stable recombinant protein to the growth medium. The P170 expression system used for recombinant protein production in L. lactis utilizes an inducible promoter, P170, which is up-regulated as lactate accumulates in the growth medium. We have optimised the components of the expression system, including improved promoter strength, signal peptides and isolation of production strains with increased productivity. Recombinant proteins are produced in a growth medium with no animal-derived components as a simple batch fermentation requiring minimal process control. The accumulation of lactate in the growth medium does, however, inhibit growth and limits the yield from batch and fed-batch processes. We therefore combined the P170 expression system with the REED technology, which allows control of lactate concentration by electro-dialysis during fermentation. Using this combination, production of the Staphylococcus aureus nuclease reached 2.5 g L(-1).
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Intensive mutagenesis of the nisin hinge leads to the rational design of enhanced derivatives.
AB  - Nisin A is the most extensively studied lantibiotic and has been used as a preservative by the food industry since 1953. This 34 amino acid peptide contains three dehydrated amino acids and five thioether rings. These rings, resulting from one lanthionine and four methyllanthionine bridges, confer the peptide with its unique structure. Nisin A has two mechanisms of action, with the N-terminal domain of the peptide inhibiting cell wall synthesis through lipid II binding and the C-terminal domain responsible for pore-formation. The focus of this study is the three amino acid 'hinge' region (N 20, M 21 and K 22) which separates these two domains and allows for conformational flexibility. As all lantibiotics are gene encoded, novel variants can be generated through manipulation of the corresponding gene. A number of derivatives in which the hinge region was altered have previously been shown to possess enhanced antimicrobial activity. Here we take this approach further by employing simultaneous, indiscriminate site-saturation mutagenesis of all three hinge residues to create a novel bank of nisin derivative producers. Screening of this bank revealed that producers of peptides with hinge regions consisting of AAK, NAI and SLS displayed enhanced bioactivity against a variety of targets. These and other results suggested a preference for small, chiral amino acids within the hinge region, leading to the design and creation of producers of peptides with hinges consisting of AAA and SAA. These producers, and the corresponding peptides, exhibited enhanced bioactivity against Lactococcus lactis HP, Streptococcus agalactiae ATCC 13813, Mycobacterium smegmatis MC2155 and Staphylococcus aureus RF122 and thus represent the first example of nisin derivatives that possess enhanced activity as a consequence of rational design.
TI  - Novel antibacterial activity of lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis z11 isolated from zabady.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to select and characterize a probiotic bacterium with distinctive antimicrobial activities. In this respect, Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis Z11 (L. lactis Z11) isolated from Zabady (Arabian yoghurt) inhibited other strains of lactic acid bacteria and some food-born pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. The inhibitory activity of cell free supernatant (CFS) of L. lactis Z11 isolated from zabady was lost by proteolytic enzymes, heat resistant. Consequently, the active substance(s) of CFS was characterized as a bacteriocin. This bacteriocin has been shown to consist of protein but has no lipidic or glucidic moieties in its active molecule. Its activity was stable in the pH range 2.0 to 7.0 and was not affected by organic solvents. The L. lactis Z11 bacteriocin was produced in CFS throughout the mide to the late exponential phase of growth of the producer organism and maximum bacteriocin production was obtained at initial pH 6.5 at incubation temperature of about 30 degrees C.
TI  - Development of an informatics platform for therapeutic protein and peptide analytics.
AB  - The momentum gained by research on biologics has not been met yet with equal thrust on the informatics side. There is a noticeable lack of software for data management that empowers the bench scientists working on the development of biologic therapeutics. SARvision|Biologics is a tool to analyze data associated with biopolymers, including peptides, antibodies, and protein therapeutics programs. The program brings under a single user interface tools to filter, mine, and visualize data as well as those algorithms needed to organize sequences. As part of the data-analysis tools, we introduce two new concepts: mutation cliffs and invariant maps. Invariant maps show the variability of properties when a monomer is maintained constant in a position of the biopolymer. Mutation cliff maps draw attention to pairs of sequences where a single or limited number of point mutations elicit a large change in a property of interest. We illustrate the program and its applications using a peptide data set collected from the literature.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Probiotic characterization of potential hydrolases producing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from pickled yam.
AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize potential probiotic strain co-producing alpha-amylase and beta-galactosidase. Sixty-three strains, isolated from pickle samples were screened for their hydrolase producing capacity by utilizing different starches as carbon source. One out of 63 strains, isolated from traditionally fermented pickled yam showing maximum hydrolase activity (alpha-amylase (36.9 U/ml) and beta-galactosidase (42.6 U/ml)) within a period of 48 hours was identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. Further, it was assessed for the probiotic characteristics under gastrointestinal conditions like acidic, alkaline, proteolytic enzymes, bile stress and found to exhibit tolerance to these stresses. The therapeutic potential of the isolate is implicated because of its antagonistic effect against enteric foodborne pathogens (Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica and Aeromonas hydrophila). The results of this study entail a potential applicability of the isolate in developing future probiotic foods besides the production of industrially significant hydrolases.
TI  - Effects of bacteriocins on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilm.
AB  - Control of biofilms formed by microbial pathogens is an important subject for medical researchers, since the development of biofilms on foreign-body surfaces often causes biofilm-associated infections in patients with indwelling medical devices. The present study examined the effects of different kinds of bacteriocins, which are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by certain bacteria, on biofilms formed by a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The activities and modes of action of three bacteriocins with different structures (nisin A, lacticin Q, and nukacin ISK-1) were evaluated. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of MRSA infections, showed bactericidal activity against planktonic cells but not against biofilm cells. Among the tested bacteriocins, nisin A showed the highest bactericidal activity against both planktonic cells and biofilm cells. Lacticin Q also showed bactericidal activity against both planktonic cells and biofilm cells, but its activity against biofilm cells was significantly lower than that of nisin A. Nukacin ISK-1 showed bacteriostatic activity against planktonic cells and did not show bactericidal activity against biofilm cells. Mode-of-action studies indicated that pore formation leading to ATP efflux is important for the bactericidal activity against biofilm cells. Our results suggest that bacteriocins that form stable pores on biofilm cells are highly potent for the treatment of MRSA biofilm infections.
TI  - Three distinct two-component systems are involved in resistance to the class I bacteriocins, Nukacin ISK-1 and nisin A, in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus uses two-component systems (TCSs) to adapt to stressful environmental conditions. To colonize a host, S. aureus must resist bacteriocins produced by commensal bacteria. In a comprehensive analysis using individual TCS inactivation mutants, the inactivation of two TCSs, graRS and braRS, significantly increased the susceptibility to the class I bacteriocins, nukacin ISK-1 and nisin A, and inactivation of vraSR slightly increased the susceptibility to nukacin ISK-1. In addition, two ABC transporters (BraAB and VraDE) regulated by BraRS and one transporter (VraFG) regulated by GraRS were associated with resistance to nukacin ISK-1 and nisin A. We investigated the role of these three TCSs of S. aureus in co-culture with S. warneri, which produces nukacin ISK-1, and Lactococcus lactis, which produces nisin A. When co-cultured with S. warneri or L. lactis, the braRS mutant showed a significant decrease in its population compared with the wild-type, whereas the graRS and vraSR mutants showed slight decreases. Expression of vraDE was elevated significantly in S. aureus co-cultured with nisin A/nukacin ISK-1-producing strains. These results suggest that three distinct TCSs are involved in the resistance to nisin A and nukacin ISK-1. Additionally, braRS and its related transporters played a central role in S. aureus survival in co-culture with the strains producing nisin A and nukacin ISK-1.
TI  - A new pentacyclic triterpene with potent antibacterial activity from Limnophila indica Linn. (Druce).
AB  - A new pentacyclic triterpenoid constituent, characterized as 3-oxo-olean-12(13),18(19)-dien-29alpha-carboxylic acid (1) on the basis of detailed spectral studies, was isolated from the aerial parts and roots of Limnophila indica (Scrophulariaceae). Compound 1 exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against three Gram-positive bacteria viz. Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes (MICs within a range of 25-30 mug/ml) and moderate activity against four Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pantoea ananatis (MICs within a range of 30-100 mug/ml). The plant pathogenic bacterium P. ananatis and human pathogenic S. typhimurium responded at comparatively higher concentrations of the compound 1, which were 75 and 100 mug/ml respectively. The compound inhibited the growth of Gram-positive B. subtilis and Gram-negative P. aeruginosa completely with a clear bactericidal mode of action at their MIC values. The compound upon treatment on both B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa released substantial amount of nucleic acid in the external medium and also effected the change of morphology towards pleomorphicity, thereby indicating its probable action on cell membrane. Furthermore, the triterpenoid 1 was found not to inhibit a probiotic lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LABW4 under in vitro condition and to possess no toxicity in Swiss albino mice.
TI  - Lactococcus lactis anchoring avian infectious bronchitis virus multi-epitope peptide EpiC induced specific immune responses in chickens.
AB  - Mucosal immunity is critical in preventing infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection. To deliver viral antigens to the mucosal immune system of chickens safely and effectively, we constructed a Lactococcus lactis strain carrying IBV multi-epitope gene EpiC fused with the gene of the cell-wall anchoring domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A. SDS-PAGE and Western blot results indicated that the fused peptide was located partially on the cell surface. Oral and nasal inoculation with the recombinant L. lactis of chickens elicited significantly high humoral and mucosal immune responses, especially in the nasally immunized group. Eighty percent chickens of the nasally immunized group with recombinant L. lactis did not show any clinical signs after a lethal dose challenge with IBV SAIBk strain, while all the non-recombinant L. lactis immunized chickens exhibited obvious and typical symptoms. These results indicate that needle-free recombinant lactococci anchoring the IBV antigen makes a promising vaccine candidate against the spread of IB.
TI  - Full functional activity of SSL7 requires binding of both complement C5 and IgA.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for a range of diseases, from local skin infections through to life-threatening illnesses such as toxic shock syndrome. S. aureus produces an assortment of molecules designed to evade or subvert the host immune system. One example is the 23 kDa staphylococcal superantigen-like protein 7 (SSL7) that simultaneously binds immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement C5 to inhibit complement-mediated hemolytic and bactericidal activity. The avirulent bacterium Lactococcus lactis was engineered to express SSL7 so that its role in bacterial survival could be assessed without interference from other virulence factors. Expression of SSL7 by L. lactis led to significantly enhanced bacterial survival in whole human blood and prevented the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) forming on the cell wall. To further understand the mechanism of action of SSL7, the activity of wild-type SSL7 protein was compared with a panel of mutant proteins lacking the capacity to bind IgA, C5, or both IgA and C5. SSL7 potently inhibited in vitro chemotaxis of inflammatory myeloid cells in response to a pathogenic stimulus and when injected into mice, SSL7 blocked the migration of neutrophils into the peritoneum in response to an inoculum of heat-killed S. aureus. Mutagenesis of the C5-binding site on SSL7 abolished all inhibitory activity, while mutation of the IgA-binding site had only partial effects, indicating that while IgA binding enhances activity it is not essential. SSL7 is an important staphylococcal virulence factor with potent anti-inflammatory properties, which are mediated by targeting complement C5 and IgA.
TI  - pDB2011, a 7.6 kb multidrug resistance plasmid from Listeria innocua replicating  in Gram-positive and Gram-negative hosts.
AB  - pDB2011, a multidrug resistance plasmid isolated from the foodborne Listeria innocua strain TTS-2011 was sequenced and characterized. Sequence analysis revealed that pDB2011 had a length of 7641 bp and contained seven coding DNA sequences of which two were annotated as replication proteins, one as a recombination/mobilization protein and one as a transposase. Furthermore, pDB2011 harbored the trimethoprim, spectinomycin and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance genes dfrD, spc and erm(A), respectively. However, pDB2011 was only associated with trimethoprim and spectinomycin resistance phenotypes and not with phenotypic resistance to erythromycin. A region of the plasmid encoding the resistance genes spc and erm(A) plus the transposase was highly similar to Staphylococcus aureus transposon Tn554. The dfrD gene was 100% identical to dfrD found in a number of Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Additionally, assessment of the potential host range of pDB2011 revealed that the plasmid was able to replicate in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 as well as in Escherichia coli MC1061 and DH5alpha. This study reports the first multidrug resistance plasmid in L. innocua. A large potential for dissemination of pDB2011 is indicated by its host range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Design and construction of a single tube, quantitative endpoint, LATE-PCR multiplex assay for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to develop a molecular diagnostic multiplex assay for the quantitative detection of microbial pathogens commonly responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and their antibiotic resistance using linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (LATE-PCR). METHOD AND RESULTS: This multiplex assay was designed for the quantitative detection and identification of pathogen genomic DNA of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plus a control target from Lactococcus lactis. After amplification, the single-stranded amplicons were detected simultaneously in the same closed tube by hybridization to low-temperature molecular beacon probes labelled with four differently coloured fluorophores. The resulting hybrids were then analysed by determining the fluorescence intensity of each of the four fluorophores as a function of temperature. CONCLUSIONS: This LATE-PCR single tube multiplex assay generated endpoint fluorescent contours that allowed identification of all microbial pathogens commonly responsible for VAP, including MRSA. The assay was quantitative, identifying the pathogens present in the sample, no matter whether there were as few as 10 or as many 100 000 target genomes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This assay is rapid, reliable and sensitive and is ready for preclinical testing using samples recovered from patients suffering from ventilator-associated pneumonia.
TI  - Oral immunization with Lactococcus lactis secreting attenuated recombinant staphylococcal enterotoxin B induces a protective immune response in a murine model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is unrestrictedly found in humans and in animal species that maintain thermal homeostasis. Inadequate cleaning of processing equipment or inappropriate handling can contaminate processed food and cause severe food poisoning. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), a potent superantigenic exotoxin, is produced by 50% of clinical isolates of S. aureus and is associated with massive food poisoning and with the induction of toxic shock syndrome. RESULTS: A gene sequence encoding a recombinant SEB (rSEB), devoid of superantigenic activity, was successfully cloned and expressed in a cytoplasmic or a secreted form in the food-grade lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis. The recombinant protein detected in the cytoplasm or in the culture medium exhibited the expected molecular mass and was recognized by a SEB-polyclonal antibody. Oral immunization with the recombinant L. lactis strains induced a protective immune response in a murine model of S. aureus infection. Immunized mice survived intraperitoneal challenge with an S. aureus SEB-producer strain. Counts of S. aureus in the spleen of rSEB-immunized mice were significantly reduced. The rSEB-immunized mice showed significant titers of anti-SEB IgA and IgG in stools and serum, respectively. Both recombinant L. lactis strains were able to elicit cellular or systemic immune responses in mice, with no significant difference if rSEB was produced in its cytoplasmic or secreted form. However, recombinant L. lactis expressing the cytoplasmic rSEB increased the survival rate of the challenged mice by 43%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show the vaccine efficacy of L. lactis carrying an attenuated SEB, in a murine model, following lethal S. aureus challenge.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of bacteriocin KU24 produced by Lactococcus lactis KU24 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Bacteriocin KU24 produced by Lactococcus lactis KU24 exhibited an inhibitory effect against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Bacteriocin KU24 was inactivated by protease XIV, showing that it has a proteinaceous nature on S. aureus ATCC 33591. Also, bacteriocin KU24 exhibited a strong heat stability (121 degrees C for 15 min) and pH stability (pH 3 to 9). The mode of inhibition was determined for S. aureus ATCC 33591 by treatment of 0, 250, and 500 AU/mL of bacteriocin KU24. S. aureus ATCC 33591 was inhibited by added bacteriocin KU24, while control was increased. The cell membranes of S. aureus ATCC 33591 were damaged with treatment of 500 AU/mL of bacteriocin KU24. Also, bacteriocin KU24 inhibited the occurrence of mecA gene, the methicillin resistance gene in S. aureus ATCC 33591. Bacteriocin KU24 was purified by C18 Sep-Pack column, cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography, and molecular mass is approximately 6.5 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results demonstrate that bacteriocin KU24 can be used as an alternative antimicrobial agent for the treatment of infection of MRSA in the food industry.
TI  - Nasal colonisation by Staphylococcus aureus depends upon clumping factor B binding to the squamous epithelial cell envelope protein loricrin.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus asymptomatically colonises the anterior nares, but the host and bacterial factors that facilitate colonisation remain incompletely understood. The S. aureus surface protein ClfB has been shown to mediate adherence to squamous epithelial cells in vitro and to promote nasal colonisation in both mice and humans. Here, we demonstrate that the squamous epithelial cell envelope protein loricrin represents the major target ligand for ClfB during S. aureus nasal colonisation. In vitro adherence assays indicated that bacteria expressing ClfB bound loricrin most likely by the "dock, lock and latch" mechanism. Using surface plasmon resonance we showed that ClfB bound cytokeratin 10 (K10), a structural protein of squamous epithelial cells, and loricrin with similar affinities that were in the low microM range. Loricrin is composed of three separate regions comprising GS-rich omega loops. Each loop was expressed separately and found to bind ClfB, However region 2 bound with highest affinity. To investigate if the specific interaction between ClfB and loricrin was sufficient to facilitate S. aureus nasal colonisation, we compared the ability of ClfB(+)S. aureus to colonise the nares of wild-type and loricrin-deficient (Lor(-)/(-)) mice. In the absence of loricrin, S. aureus nasal colonisation was significantly impaired. Furthermore a ClfB(-) mutant colonised wild-type mice less efficiently than the parental ClfB(+) strain whereas a similar lower level of colonisation was observed with both the parental strain and the ClfB(-) mutant in the Lor(-)/(-) mice. The ability of ClfB to support nasal colonisation by binding loricrin in vivo was confirmed by the ability of Lactococcus lactis expressing ClfB to be retained in the nares of WT mice but not in the Lor(-)/(-) mice. By combining in vitro biochemical analysis with animal model studies we have identified the squamous epithelial cell envelope protein loricrin as the target ligand for ClfB during nasal colonisation by S. aureus.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a nisin-like bacteriocin produced by a Lactococcus lactis strain isolated from charqui, a Brazilian fermented, salted and dried meat product.
AB  - A Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strain (L. lactis 69) capable to produce a heat-stable bacteriocin was isolated from charqui, a Brazilian fermented, salted and sun-dried meat product. The bacteriocin inhibited, in vitro, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, several lactic acid bacteria isolated from foods and spoilage halotolerant bacteria isolated from charqui. The activity of the bacteriocin was not affected by pH (2.0-10.0), heating (100 degrees C), and chemical agents (1% w/v). Treatment of growing cells of L. monocytogenes ScottA with the cell-free supernatant of L. lactis 69 resulted in complete cell inactivation. L. lactis 69 harbored the gene for the production of a nisin-like bacteriocin, and the amino acid sequence of the active peptide was identical to sequences previously described for nisin Z. However, differences were observed regarding the leader peptide. Besides, the isolate was able to survive and produce bacteriocins in culture medium with NaCl content up to 20%, evidencing a potential application as an additional hurdle in the preservation of charqui.
TI  - Complement regulator C4BP binds to Staphylococcus aureus surface proteins SdrE and Bbp inhibiting bacterial opsonization and killing.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a premier human pathogen and the most common cause of osteoarticular, wound, and implanted device infections. We recently demonstrated S. aureus efficiently binds the classical complement regulator C4b-binding protein (C4BP) inhibiting antibody-initiated complement-mediated opsonization. Here we identify S. aureus surface protein SdrE as a C4BP-binding protein. Recombinant SdrE and recombinant bone sialoprotein-binding protein (Bbp), an allelic variant of SdrE, both efficiently bound to C4BP in heat-inactivated human serum. We previously described SdrE as binding alternative pathway regulator factor H. Recombinant SdrE and Bbp efficiently bound C4BP and factor H in serum without apparent interference. Gain of function studies utilizing Lactococcus lactis clones expressing SdrE or Bbp increased serum C4BP and factor H binding, compared with empty-vector control (WT) approximately 2-fold. Correspondingly, classical pathway-mediated C3-fragment opsonization and bacterial killing by human neutrophils decreased by half for L. lactis clones expressing SdrE or Bbp compared with WT. In summary, we identify SdrE and allelic variant Bbp as S. aureus surface proteins that bind the complement regulator C4BP inhibiting classical pathway-mediated bacterial opsonization and killing.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo characterization of DNA delivery using recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing a mutated form of L. monocytogenes Internalin A.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of food-grade Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) as DNA delivery vehicles represents an attractive strategy to deliver DNA vaccines at the mucosal surfaces as they are generally regarded as safe (GRAS). We previously showed that either native Lactococcus lactis (LL) or recombinant invasive LL expressing Fibronectin Binding Protein A of Staphylococcus aureus (LL-FnBPA+) or Internalin A of Listeria monocytogenes (LL-InlA+), were able to deliver and trigger DNA expression by epithelial cells, either in vitro or in vivo. InlA does not bind to its receptor, the murine E-cadherin, thus limiting the use of LL-InlA+ in in vivo murine models. Moreover, FnBPA binds to its receptors, integrins, via fibronectin introducing another limiting factor. In order to avoid the limitations of LL-InlA+ and LL-FnBPA+, a new L. lactis strain was engineered to produce a previously described mutated form of InlA (LL-mInlA+) allowing the binding of mInlA on murine E-cadherin. RESULTS: After showing the expression of mInLA at the surface of LL-mInlA+ strain, in vitro gentamycin survival assay in Caco-2 cells showed that LL-mInlA+ is 1000 times more invasive than LL. LL-mInlA+ invasivity was also validated by fluorescence microscopy. LL and LL-mInlA+ were transformed with pValacBLG, a plasmid containing the cDNA of bovine beta-Lactoglobulin (BLG), resulting in strains LL-BLG and LL-mInlA+BLG. The plasmid transfer in vitro using LL-mInlA+BLG was increased 10 times compared to LL-BLG. Moreover, the number of mice producing BLG in isolated enterocytes after oral administration of LL-mInlA+BLG in vivo was slightly higher than after oral administration of LL-BLG. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed in this study that the production of mInlA at the surface of L. lactis is a promising strategy for plasmid transfer in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Use of a human-like low-grade bacteremia model of experimental endocarditis to study the role of Staphylococcus aureus adhesins and platelet aggregation in early endocarditis.
AB  - Animal models of infective endocarditis (IE) induced by high-grade bacteremia revealed the pathogenic roles of Staphylococcus aureus surface adhesins and platelet aggregation in the infection process. In humans, however, S. aureus IE possibly occurs through repeated bouts of low-grade bacteremia from a colonized site or intravenous device. Here we used a rat model of IE induced by continuous low-grade bacteremia to explore further the contributions of S. aureus virulence factors to the initiation of IE. Rats with aortic vegetations were inoculated by continuous intravenous infusion (0.0017 ml/min over 10 h) with 10(6) CFU of Lactococcus lactis pIL253 or a recombinant L. lactis strain expressing an individual S. aureus surface protein (ClfA, FnbpA, BCD, or SdrE) conferring a particular adhesive or platelet aggregation property. Vegetation infection was assessed 24 h later. Plasma was collected at 0, 2, and 6 h postinoculation to quantify the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10. The percentage of vegetation infection relative to that with strain pIL253 (11%) increased when binding to fibrinogen was conferred on L. lactis (ClfA strain) (52%; P = 0.007) and increased further with adhesion to fibronectin (FnbpA strain) (75%; P < 0.001). Expression of fibronectin binding alone was not sufficient to induce IE (BCD strain) (10% of infection). Platelet aggregation increased the risk of vegetation infection (SdrE strain) (30%). Conferring adhesion to fibrinogen and fibronectin favored IL-1beta and IL-6 production. Our results, with a model of IE induced by low-grade bacteremia, resembling human disease, extend the essential role of fibrinogen binding in the initiation of S. aureus IE. Triggering of platelet aggregation or an inflammatory response may contribute to or promote the development of IE.
TI  - Isolation, biochemical characterization, and cloning of a bacteriocin from the poultry-associated Staphylococcus aureus strain CH-91.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus strain CH-91, isolated from a broiler chicken with atopic dermatitis, has a highly proteolytic phenotype that is correlated with the disease. We describe the isolation and biochemical and molecular characterization of the AI-type lantibiotic BacCH91 from S. aureus CH-91 culture medium. The bacteriocin was purified using a three-stage procedure comprising precipitation with ammonium sulfate, extraction with organic solvents, and reversed-phase HPLC. The BacCH91 peptide is thermostable and highly resistant to cleavage by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic peptidases. The MIC for the Gram-positive bacteria ranged from 2.5 nM for Microococcus luteus through 1.3-6.0 muM for staphylococcal strains up to more than 100 muM for Lactococcus lactis. BacCH91 was ineffective against the Gram-negative strains tested at the maximal concentration (100 muM). The amino acid sequence of BacCH91 is similar to that of epidermin and gallidermin. The encoding gene (bacCH91) occurred in two allelic variants distinguishable in the restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Variant I, identified in S. aureus CH-91, dominated in S. aureus strains of poultry origin, although strains with variant II were also identified in this group. S. aureus strains of human origin were characterized exclusively by variant II.
TI  - First ever isolation of bacterial prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase in single step from Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The unique bacterial enzyme phosphatidylglycerol: prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt) is the least studied enzyme of the ubiquitous bacterial lipoprotein synthetic pathway, mostly due to the low abundance of the enzyme. So far, Lgt has been studied to a limited extent in gram-negative bacteria, mainly in Escherichia coli. We, for the first time, report the isolation of an adequate amount of Lgt from the gram-positive lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis and compare this wild-type bacterial enzyme with the E. coli enzyme. The L. lactis Lgt, when purified by cationic-exchange chromatography, showed a 20-fold increase in the specific activity compared to that of the load, and 75% of the total Lgt activity loaded was recovered. Kinetically, L. lactis Lgt was found to be similar to the E. coli enzyme with matching K(m) and V(max), whereas the specific activity of the L. lactis enzyme was about 20 times less than that of the E. coli enzyme. Comparative bioinformatic analysis of L. lactis, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus Lgt revealed that the conserved and catalytically important His-103 residue in E. coli Lgt, was altered to Tyr in L. lactis. Investigations showed that other bacteria where this alteration is visible, form a diversion within the gram-positive bacteria in evolution. Further analysis revealed Mycobacterium smegmatis to be the species which evolved with the alteration of His to Tyr.
TI  - Design of a single-tube, endpoint, linear-after-the-exponential-PCR assay for 17  pathogens associated with sepsis.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to construct a single-tube multiplex molecular diagnostic assay using linear-after-the-exponential (LATE)-PCR for the detection of 17 microbial pathogens commonly associated with septicaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: The assay described here detects 17 pathogens associated with sepsis via amplification and analysis of gene-specific sequences. The pathogens and their targeted genes were: Klebsiella spp. (phoE); Acinetobacter baumannii (gyrB); Staphylococcus aureus (spa); Enterobacter spp. (thdF); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (toxA); coagulase-negative staphylococci (tuf), Enterococcus spp. (tuf); Candida spp. (P450). A sequence from an unidentified gene in Lactococcus lactis, served as a positive control for assay function. LATE-PCR was used to generate single-stranded amplicons that were analysed at endpoint over a wide range of temperatures in four fluorescent colours. Each target was detected by its pattern of hybridization to a sequence-specific low-temperature fluorescent probe derived from molecular beacons. CONCLUSIONS: All 17 microbial targets were detected in samples containing low numbers of pathogen genomes in the presence of high levels of human genomic DNA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This assay used new technology to achieve an advance in the field of molecular diagnostics: a single-tube assay for detection of pathogens commonly responsible for septicaemia.
TI  - Engineering signal peptides for enhanced protein secretion from Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis is an attractive vehicle for biotechnological production of proteins and clinical delivery of therapeutics. In many such applications using this host, it is desirable to maximize secretion of recombinant proteins into the extracellular space, which is typically achieved by using the native signal peptide from a major secreted lactococcal protein, Usp45. In order to further increase protein secretion from L. lactis, inherent limitations of the Usp45 signal peptide (Usp45sp) must be elucidated. Here, we performed extensive mutagenesis on Usp45sp to probe the effects of both the mRNA sequence (silent mutations) and the peptide sequence (amino acid substitutions) on secretion. We screened signal peptides based on their resulting secretion levels of Staphylococcus aureus nuclease and further evaluated them for secretion of Bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase. Silent mutations alone gave an increase of up to 16% in the secretion of alpha-amylase through a mechanism consistent with relaxed mRNA folding around the ribosome binding site and enhanced translation. Targeted amino acid mutagenesis in Usp45sp, combined with additional silent mutations from the best clone in the initial screen, yielded an increase of up to 51% in maximum secretion of alpha-amylase while maintaining secretion at lower induction levels. The best sequence from our screen preserves the tripartite structure of the native signal peptide but increases the positive charge of the n-region. Our study presents the first example of an engineered L. lactis signal peptide with a higher secretion yield than Usp45sp and, more generally, provides strategies for further enhancing protein secretion in bacterial hosts.
TI  - Production of Fibronectin Binding Protein A at the surface of Lactococcus lactis  increases plasmid transfer in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Lactococci are noninvasive lactic acid bacteria frequently used as protein delivery vectors and, more recently, as DNA delivery vehicles. We previously showed that Lactococcus lactis (LL) expressing the Fibronectin-Binding Protein A of Staphylococcus aureus (LL-FnBPA+) showed higher internalization rates in vitro in Caco-2 cells than the native (wt) lactococci and were able to deliver a eukaryotic Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expression plasmid in 1% of human Caco-2 cells. Here, using the bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), one of the major cow's milk allergen, and GFP we characterized the potential of LL-FnBPA+ as an in vivo DNA vaccine delivery vehicle. We first showed that the invasive strain LL-FnBPA+ carrying the plasmid pValac:BLG (LL-FnBPA+ BLG) was more invasive than LL-BLG and showed the same invasivity as LL-FnBPA+. Then we demonstrated that the Caco-2 cells, co-incubated with LL-FnBPA+ BLG produced up to 30 times more BLG than the Caco-2 cells co-incubated with the non invasive LL-BLG. Using two different gene reporters, BLG and GFP, and two different methods of detection, EIA and fluorescence microscopy, we showed in vivo that: i) in order to be effective, LL-FnBPA+ required a pre-coating with Fetal Calf Serum before oral administration; ii) plasmid transfer occurred in enterocytes without regard to the strains used (invasive or not); iii) the use of LL-FnBPA+ increased the number of mice producing BLG, but not the level of BLG produced. We thus confirmed the good potential of invasive recombinant lactic acid bacteria as DNA delivery vector in vivo.
TI  - Iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins of Staphylococcus lugdunensis.
AB  - Staphylococcus lugdunensis is the only coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species  with a locus encoding iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins. In Staphylococcus aureus, the Isd proteins capture heme from hemoglobin and transfer it across the wall to a membrane-bound transporter, which delivers it into the cytoplasm, where heme oxygenases release iron. The Isd proteins of S. lugdunensis are expressed under iron-restricted conditions. We propose that S. lugdunensis IsdB and IsdC proteins perform the same functions as those of S. aureus. S. lugdunensis IsdB is the only hemoglobin receptor within the isd locus. It specifically binds human hemoglobin with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 23 nM and transfers heme on IsdC. IsdB expression promotes bacterial growth in an iron-limited medium containing human hemoglobin but not mouse hemoglobin. This correlates with weak binding of IsdB to mouse hemoglobin in vitro. Unlike IsdB and IsdC, the proteins IsdJ and IsdK are not sorted to the cell wall in S. lugdunensis. In contrast, IsdJ expressed in S. aureus and Lactococcus lactis is anchored to peptidoglycan, suggesting that S. lugdunensis sortases may differ in signal recognition or could be defective. IsdJ and IsdK are present in the culture supernatant, suggesting that they could acquire heme from the external milieu. The IsdA protein of S. aureus protects bacteria from bactericidal lipids due to its hydrophilic C-terminal domain. IsdJ has a similar region and protected S. aureus and L. lactis as efficiently as IsdA but, possibly due to its location, was less effective in its natural host.
TI  - Stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus spp.
AB  - The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (FI8595), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG 1363), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (IL 1403), and Streptococcus thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. Both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids into biogenic amine. The conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/L) by Lactobacillus spp. Gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis, S. aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively. Significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (P < 0.05). The role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. Cadaverine accumulation by Enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for St. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by S. Paratyphi A. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis and Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by P. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and TMA in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . The result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.
TI  - Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of Staphylococcus aureus surface LPXTG-proteins: correlation with agr genotypes and adherence phenotypes.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus infections involve numerous adhesins and toxins, which expression depends on complex regulatory networks. Adhesins include a family of surface proteins covalently attached to the peptidoglycan via a conserved LPXTG motif. Here we determined the protein and mRNA expression of LPXTG-proteins of S. aureus Newman in time-course experiments, and their relation to fibrinogen adherence in vitro. Experiments were performed with mutants in the global accessory-gene regulator (agr), surface protein A (Spa), and fibrinogen-binding protein A (ClfA), as well as during growth in iron-rich or iron-poor media. Surface proteins were recovered by trypsin-shaving of live bacteria. Released peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectrometry. To unambiguously identify peptides unique to LPXTG-proteins, the analytical conditions were refined using a reference library of S. aureus LPXTG-proteins heterogeneously expressed in surrogate Lactococcus lactis. Transcriptomes were determined by microarrays. Sixteen of the 18 LPXTG-proteins present in S. aureus Newman were detected by proteomics. Nine LPXTG-proteins showed a bell-shape agr-like expression that was abrogated in agr-negative mutants including Spa, fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA), ClfA, iron-binding IsdA, and IsdB, immunomodulator SasH, functionally uncharacterized SasD, biofilm-related SasG and methicillin resistance-related FmtB. However, only Spa and SasH modified their proteomic and mRNA profiles in parallel in the parent and its agr- mutant, whereas all other LPXTG-proteins modified their proteomic profiles independently of their mRNA. Moreover, ClfA became highly transcribed and active in fibrinogen-adherence tests during late growth (24 h), whereas it remained poorly detected by proteomics. On the other hand, iron-regulated IsdA-B-C increased their protein expression by >10-times in iron-poor conditions. Thus, proteomic, transcriptomic, and adherence-phenotype demonstrated differential profiles in S. aureus. Moreover, trypsin peptide signatures suggested differential protein domain exposures in various environments, which might be relevant for anti-adhesin vaccines. A comprehensive understanding of the S. aureus physiology should integrate all three approaches.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus surface protein SdrE binds complement regulator factor H as an immune evasion tactic.
AB  - Similar to other highly successful invasive bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus recruits the complement regulatory protein factor H (fH) to its surface to inhibit the alternative pathway of complement. Here, we report the identification of the surface-associated protein SdrE as a fH-binding protein using purified fH overlay of S. aureus fractionated cell wall proteins and fH cross-linking to S. aureus followed by mass spectrometry. Studies using recombinant SdrE revealed that rSdrE bound significant fH whether from serum or as a purified form, in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, rSdrE-bound fH exhibited cofactor functionality for factor I (fI)-mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b which correlated positively with increasing amounts of fH. Expression of SdrE on the surface of the surrogate bacterium Lactococcus lactis enhanced recruitment of fH which resulted in increased iC3b generation. Moreover, surface expression of SdrE led to a reduction in C3-fragment deposition, less C5a generation, and reduced killing by polymorphonuclear cells. Thus, we report the first identification of a S. aureus protein associated with the staphylococcal surface that binds factor H as an immune evasion mechanism.
TI  - Isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  - The bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. The Lactococcus lactis strain PSY2 (GenBank account no. JF703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch Perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria viz. Arthrobacter sp., Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. The biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin PSY2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, Epinephelus diacanthus. The fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of 1,600 AU/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees C. The biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees C to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. The total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. Chemical analysis revealed a significant change (P < 0.05) in the pH value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total methyl amine content in the treated samples. The overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees C while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. The biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees C. Thus, the bacteriocin derived from L. lactis PSY2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.
TI  - Characteristics of microbial biofilm on wooden vats ('gerles') in PDO Salers cheese.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize microbial biofilms from 'gerles' (wooden vats for making PDO Salers cheese) and identify their role in milk inoculation and in preventing pathogen development. Gerles from ten farms producing PDO Salers cheese were subjected to microbial analysis during at least 4 periods spread over two years. They were distinguished by their levels of Lactobacillus (between 4.50 and 6.01 log CFU/cm(2)), Gram negative bacteria (between 1.45 and 4.56 log CFU/cm(2)), yeasts (between 2.91 and 5.57 log CFU/cm(2)), and moulds (between 1.72 and 4.52 log CFU/cm(2)). They were then classed into 4 groups according their microbial characteristics. These 4 groups were characterized by different milk inoculations (with either sour whey or starter culture, daily or not), and different washing procedures (with water or whey from cheese making). The farm gerles were not contaminated by Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes or Staphylococcus aureus. Only one slight, punctual contamination was found on one gerle among the ten studied. Even when the milk was deliberately contaminated with L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in the 40 L experimental gerles, these pathogens were found neither on the gerle surfaces nor in the cheeses. Using 40 L experimental gerles it was shown that the microbial biofilms on the gerle surfaces formed in less than one week and then remained stable. They were mainly composed of a great diversity of lactic acid bacteria (Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus hilgardii,...), Gram positive catalase positive bacteria (Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Curtobacterium oceanosedimentum Citrococcus spp., Brachybacterium rhamnosum, Kocuria rhizophila, Arthrobacter spp....) and yeast (Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus). In less than 1 min, even in a 500 L farm gerle, the gerle's microbial biofilm can inoculate pasteurized milk with micro-organisms at levels superior to those in raw milk.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from farmed seabass Dicentrarchus labrax.
AB  - The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing attention. In the present study, 47 LAB strains were isolated from farmed seabass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) and were phenotypically and phylogenetically analysed by 16S rDNA and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA - polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR). Their antimicrobial effect was tested in vitro against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. Most of the strains isolated were enterococci belonging to the following species: Enterococcus faecium (59%), Enterococcus faecalis (21%), Enterococcus sanguinicola (4 strains), Enterococcus mundtii (1 strain), Enterococcus pseudoavium (1 strain), and Lactococcus lactis (1 strain). An Aerococcus viridans strain was also isolated. The survey of their antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal medicine. Different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and intestines isolates. More than 69% (32 strains) of the isolates inhibited the growth of the majority of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrio anguillarum, and Carnobacterium sp. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactive enterococcal species isolated from seabass that could potentially inhibit the undesirable bacteria found in food systems.
TI  - Lytic activity of LysH5 endolysin secreted by Lactococcus lactis using the secretion signal sequence of bacteriocin Lcn972.
AB  - Bacteriophage endolysins have an interesting potential as antimicrobials. The endolysin LysH5, encoded by Staphylococcus aureus phage vB_SauS-phi-IPLA88, was expressed and secreted in Lactococcus lactis using the signal peptide of bacteriocin lactococcin 972 and lactococcal constitutive and inducible promoters. Up to 80 U/mg of extracellular active endolysin was detected in culture supernatants, but most of the protein (up to 323 U/mg) remained in the cell extracts.
TI  - Nisin F-loaded brushite bone cement prevented the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in vivo.
AB  - AIMS: To determine if nisin F-loaded self-setting brushite cement could control the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Brushite cement was prepared by mixing equimolar concentrations of beta-tricalcium phosphate and monocalcium phosphate monohydrate. Nisin F was added at 5.0, 2.5 and 1.0% (w/w) and the cement moulded into cylinders. In vitro antibacterial activity was determined using a delayed agar diffusion assay. Release of nisin F from the cement was determined using BCA protein assays. Based on scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis, nisin F did not cause significant changes in cement structure or chemistry. Cement containing 5.0% (w/w) nisin F yielded the most promising in vitro results. Nisin F-loaded cement was implanted into a subcutaneous pocket on the back of mice and then infected with S. aureus Xen 36. Infection was monitored for 7 days, using an in vivo imaging system. Nisin F prevented S. aureus infection for 7 days and no viable cells were isolated from the implants. CONCLUSIONS: Nisin F-loaded brushite cement successfully prevented in vivo growth of S. aureus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Nisin F incorporated into bone cement may be used to control S. aureus infection in vivo.
TI  - The fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in Danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in Danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rDNA and cDNA. Furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on survival of added Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR. A high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. Bacteria belonging to the genera Brevibacterium, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Weissella, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus were also detected in both 16S rDNA and cDNA obtained from raw milk and cheeses. E. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both DNA and RNA extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. Growth of E. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of raw milk. Growth of L. innocua and S. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all cheeses at different stages of ripening. The use of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.
TI  - Homologues and bioengineered derivatives of LtnJ vary in ability to form D-alanine in the lantibiotic lacticin 3147.
AB  - Ltnalpha and Ltnbeta are individual components of the two-peptide lantibiotic lacticin 3147 and are unusual in that, although ribosomally synthesized, they contain d-amino acids. These result from the dehydration of l-serine to dehydroalanine by LtnM and subsequent stereospecific hydrogenation to d-alanine by LtnJ. Homologues of LtnJ are rare but have been identified in silico in Staphylococcus aureus C55 (SacJ), Pediococcus pentosaceus FBB61 (PenN), and Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102 (NpnJ, previously called NpunJ [P. D. Cotter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102:18584-18589, 2005]). Here, the ability of these enzymes to catalyze d-alanine formation in the lacticin 3147 system was assessed through heterologous enzyme production in a DeltaltnJ mutant. PenN successfully incorporated d-alanines in both peptides, and SacJ modified Ltnalpha only, while NpnJ was unable to modify either peptide. Site-directed mutagenesis was also employed to identify residues of key importance in LtnJ. The most surprising outcome from these investigations was the generation of peptides by specific LtnJ mutants which exhibited less bioactivity than those generated by the DeltaltnJ strain. We have established that the reduced activity of these peptides is due to the inability of the associated LtnJ enzymes to generate d-alanine residues in a stereospecific manner, resulting in the presence of both d- and l-alanines at the relevant locations in the lacticin 3147 peptides.
TI  - Short communication: characterization of microflora in Mexican Chihuahua cheese.
AB  - This work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 Chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in Mexico using 16S rRNA gene analysis. As expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. Sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in 9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. Lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent being Lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Streptococcus macedonicus were identified in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional Chihuahua cheese attributes.
TI  - Typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR to assess genetic diversity.
AB  - The recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. The current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified DNA, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. We have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. Initially, purified DNA and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. The conditions that were found to be optimal 8 muM of 10-mer primers, 3 muM magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The RAPD genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) PFU mL(-1) were highly reproducible. Clustering by the Pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar DNA restriction pattern were indistinguishable. The results support the use of RAPD-PCR for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of their genetic diversity bypassing tedious DNA purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.
TI  - Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopies for the rapid detection, enumeration, and growth interaction of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris in milk.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is one of the main pathogenic microorganisms found in milk  and dairy products and has been involved in bacterial foodborne outbreaks in the past. Current enumeration techniques for bacteria are very time-consuming, typically taking 24 h or longer, and bacterial antagonism in the form of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) may inhibit the growth of S. aureus . Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to establish the accuracy and sensitivity of rapid nondestructive metabolic fingerprinting techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy (RS), in combination with multivariate analysis techniques, for the detection and enumeration of S. aureus in milk, as well as to study the growth interaction between S. aureus and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris , a common LAB. The two bacterial species were investigated both in a pure monoculture and in a combined inoculated coculture after inoculation into ultraheated milk during the first 24 h of growth at 37 degrees C. Plating techniques were used to obtain primary reference data for viable bacteria counts. Principal component discriminant function analysis, canonical correlation analysis, partial least-squares (PLS), and kernel PLS (KPLS) multivariate statistical techniques were employed to analyze the data. FT-IR provided very reasonable quantification results both with PLS and KPLS, the latter providing marginally better predictions, with correlation coefficients in the test set (Q(2)) and training set (R(2)) varying from 0.64 to 0.76 and from 0.78 to 0.88 for different bacterial sample combinations. RS results were less encouraging with high degrees of error and poor correlation to viable bacterial counts. S. aureus growth was not inhibited by the presence of the LAB, but metabolic fingerprinting of the coculture indicated that the phenotype of this dual bacterial culture was closer to that of pure LAB cultures. In conclusion, FT-IR spectroscopy in combination with the above multivariate techniques appears to be a promising discrimination and enumeration analytical technique for the two bacterial species. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the L. cremoris metabolic effect in milk dominates that of S. aureus even though there was no growth antagonism observed.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus virulence and metabolism are dramatically affected by Lactococcus lactis in cheese matrix.
AB  - In complex environments such as cheeses, the lack of relevant information on the  physiology and virulence expression of pathogenic bacteria and the impact of endogenous microbiota has hindered progress in risk assessment and control. Here, we investigated the behaviour of Staphylococcus aureus, a major foodborne pathogen, in a cheese matrix, either alone or in the presence of Lactococcus lactis, as a dominant species of cheese ecosystems. The dynamics of S. aureus was explored in situ by coupling a microbiological and, for the first time, a transcriptomic approach. Lactococcus lactis affected the carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolisms and the stress response of S. aureus by acidifying, proteolysing and decreasing the redox potential of the cheese matrix. Enterotoxin expression was positively or negatively modulated by both L. lactis and the cheese matrix itself, depending on the enterotoxin type. Among the main enterotoxins involved in staphylococcal food poisoning, sea expression was slightly favoured in the presence of L. lactis, whereas a strong repression of sec4 was observed in cheese matrix, even in the absence of L. lactis, and correlated with a reduced saeRS expression. Remarkably, the agr system was downregulated by the presence of L. lactis, in part because of the decrease in pH. This study highlights the intimate link between environment, metabolism and virulence, as illustrated by the influence of the cheese matrix context, including the presence of L. lactis, on two major virulence regulators, the agr system and saeRS.
TI  - Bioengineering of a Nisin A-producing Lactococcus lactis to create isogenic strains producing the natural variants Nisin F, Q and Z.
AB  - Nisin is the prototypical example of the lantibiotic family of antimicrobial peptides and has been employed as a food preservative for over half a century. It has also attracted attention due to its potency against a number of multidrug-resistant clinical pathogens. Nisin A is the originally isolated form of Nisin and a further five natural variants have been described which differ by up to 10 amino acids (of 34 in total in Nisin A). Nisins A, Z, F and Q are produced by Lactococcus lactis, while Nisins U and U2 are produced by Streptococcus sp. In this study we bioengineered the nisA gene of a Nisin A producer to generate genes encoding Nisins Z, F, Q, U and U2. We determined that while active Nisin Z, F and Q can be produced against this genetic background, active forms of Nisin U and U2 are not generated. Minimum inhibitory concentration studies with Nisin A, Z, F and Q variants against a series of different clinically significant pathogens establish differences in specific activities against selected targets. Nisin F was most impressive, being the most active, or one of the most active, against the MRSA strain ST 525, EC 676, EC 725, VISA 22900, VISA 22781, hVISA 35197, Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4 and L. lactis HP. Nisin Z was most active against ST 299, hVISA 32683 and, together with Nisin F, HP but had contrastingly poor activity against ST 525, EC 676 and 8325-4. Nisin F, Q and A exhibited similar potency against VISA 22900. This was the only target against which Nisin Q and Nisin A were among the most active variants.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - Manipulation of charged residues within the two-peptide lantibiotic lacticin 3147.
AB  - Lantibiotics are antimicrobial peptides which contain a high percentage of post-translationally modified residues. While most attention has been paid to the role of these critical structural features, evidence continues to emerge that charged amino acids also play a key role in these peptides. Here 16 'charge' mutants of the two-peptide lantibiotic lacticin 3147 [composed of Ltnalpha (2+, 2-) and Ltnbeta (2+)] were constructed which, when supplemented with previously generated peptides, results in a total bank of 23 derivatives altered in one or more charged residues. When examined individually, in combination with a wild-type partner or, in some instances, in combination with one another, these mutants reveal the importance of charge at specific locations within Ltnalpha and Ltnbeta, confirm the critical role of the negatively charged glutamate residue in Ltnalpha and facilitate an investigation of the contribution of positively charged residues to the cationic Ltnbeta. From these investigations it is also apparent that the relative importance of the overall charge of lacticin 3147 varies depending on the target bacteria and is most evident when strains with more negatively charged cell envelopes are targeted. These studies also result in, for the first time, the creation of a derivative of a lacticin 3147 peptide (LtnbetaR27A) which displays enhanced specific activity.
TI  - Multiple antibacterial histone H2B proteins are expressed in tissues of American  oyster.
AB  - We have previously identified a histone H2B isomer (cvH2B-1) from tissue extracts of the bivalve mollusk, the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica). In this paper, we isolate an additional three antibacterial proteins from acidified gill extract by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Extraction of these proteins from tissue was best accomplished by briefly boiling the tissues in a weak acetic acid solution. Addition of protease inhibitors while boiling resulted in somewhat lower yields, with one protein being totally absent with this method. Via mass spectrometry, the masses of one of these purified proteins was 13607.0Da (peak 2), which is consistent with the molecular weight of histone H2B. In addition, via western-blotting using anti-calf histone H2B antibody, all three proteins were positive and were thus named cvH2B-2, cvH2B-3 and cvH2B-4. The antibacterial activity of cvH2B-2 was similar to that of cvH2B-1, with activity against a Gram-positive bacterium (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis; minimum effective concentration [MEC] 52-57mug/mL) but inactive against Staphylococcus aureus (MEC>250mug/mL). However, both proteins had relatively potent activity against the Gram-negative oyster pathogen Vibrio parahemolyticus (MEC 11.5-14mug/mL) as well as the human pathogen Vibrio vulnificus (MEC 21.3-25.3mug/mL). cvH2B-3 and cvH2B-4 also had similarly strong activity against Vibrio vulnificus. These data provide further evidence for the antimicrobial function of histone H2B isomers in modulating bacterial populations in oyster tissues. The combined estimated concentrations of these histone H2B isomers were far above the inhibitory concentrations for the tested vibrios, including human pathogens. Our results indicate that the highly conserved histone proteins might be important components not only of immune defenses in oysters but have the potential to influence the abundance of a ubiquitous microbial resident of oyster tissues that is the major source of seafood-borne illness in humans.
TI  - Role of surface protein SasG in biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The SasG surface protein of Staphylococcus aureus has been shown to promote the formation of biofilm. SasG comprises an N-terminal A domain and repeated B domains. Here we demonstrate that SasG is involved in the accumulation phase of biofilm, a process that requires a physiological concentration of Zn(2+). The B domains, but not the A domain, are required. Purified recombinant B domain protein can form dimers in vitro in a Zn(2+)-dependent fashion. Furthermore, the protein can bind to cells that have B domains anchored to their surface and block biofilm formation. The full-length SasG protein exposed on the cell surface is processed within the B domains to a limited degree, resulting in cleaved proteins of various lengths being released into the supernatant. Some of the released molecules associate with the surface-exposed B domains that remain attached to the cell. Studies using inhibitors and mutants failed to identify any protease that could cause the observed cleavage within the B domains. Extensively purified recombinant B domain protein is very labile, and we propose that cleavage occurs spontaneously at labile peptide bonds and that this is necessary for biofilm formation.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial effect and in vivo preventive and therapeutic effects of partially purified lantibiotic lacticin NK34 against infection by Staphylococcus species isolated from bovine mastitis.
AB  - Lantibiotics are small (<5 kDa), polycyclic peptides produced by gram-positive bacteria; they are also known as gram-positive bacteriocins. The high antimicrobial activity of lacticins and the continuing appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in recent years have resulted in a renewed interest in lantibiotics. A partially purified form of lacticin NK34 (a Lactococcus lactis product isolated from the Korean fermented fish jeotgal) was tested to determine its antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus (n=20) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS, n=20) strains isolated from the raw milk of cows with subclinical bovine mastitis in the present study. The spot-on-lawn assay was used to identify the 2 strains from each group with the greatest lacticin NK34 susceptibility, and the minimal lethal dose (MLD) was measured in ICR (imprinting control region) mice. The preventive and therapeutic effects of lacticin NK34 on the mouse infection model were determined for the first time. Lacticin NK34 demonstrated antimicrobial effects in 14 of 20 (70%) S. aureus indicator strains and in 18 of 20 (90%) CNS strains. Staphylococcus aureus 69 and S. simulans 55 demonstrated the greatest susceptibility to lacticin NK34 in the spot-on-lawn assay. The S. aureus 69 MLD was measured at 1.53 x 10(9) cfu/mouse, whereas the S. simulans 55 MLD was 3.59 x 10(9) cfu/mouse. Mice infected experimentally with S. aureus 69 MLD or S. simulans 55 MLD were treated with lacticin NK34. Treated mice demonstrated an 80% survival rate (48 of 60 mice) compared with a survival rate of 7.5% (3 of 40 mice) in control mice treated with distilled water. These data suggest that lacticin NK34 might be useful in the control of bovine mastitis and systemic bacterial infection.
TI  - Production and purification of staphylococcal nuclease in Lactococcus lactis using a new expression-secretion system and a pH-regulated mini-reactor.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcal (or micrococcal) nuclease or thermonuclease (SNase or  Nuc) is a naturally-secreted nucleic acid degrading enzyme that participates in Staphylococcus aureus spread in the infected host. Purified Nuc protein can be used as an exogenous reagent to clear cellular extracts and improve protein purification. Here, a recombinant form of Nuc was produced and secreted in a Gram-positive host, Lactococcus lactis, and purified from the culture medium. RESULTS: The gene segment corresponding to the S. aureus nuclease without its signal peptide was cloned in an expression-secretion vector. It was then fused to a lactococcal sequence encoding a signal peptide, and expressed under the control of a lactococcal promoter that is inducible by zinc starvation. An L. lactis subsp cremoris model strain (MG1363) transformed with the resulting plasmid was grown in either of two media (GM17v and CDM) that are free of animal compounds, allowing GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) production. Induction conditions (concentration of the metal chelator EDTA and timing of addition) in small-scale pH-regulated fermentors were optimized using LacMF (Lactis Multi-Fermentor), a home-made parallel fermentation control system able to monitor 12 reactors simultaneously. Large amounts of recombinant Nuc (rNuc) were produced and secreted in both media, and rNuc was purified from GM17v medium in a single-step procedure. CONCLUSIONS: In L. lactis, rNuc production and secretion were optimal after induction by 0.5 mM EDTA in small scale (200 mL) GM17v exponential phase cultures (at an OD(600) of 2), leading to a maximal protein yield of 210 mg per L of culture medium. Purified rNuc was highly active, displaying a specific activity of 2000 U/mg.
TI  - Role of antioxidant enzymes in bacterial resistance to organic acids.
AB  - Growth in aerobic environments has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to cause oxidative stress in most organisms. Antioxidant enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutases and hydroperoxidases) and DNA repair mechanisms provide protection against ROS. Acid stress has been shown to be associated with the induction of Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus aureus. However, the relationship between acid stress and oxidative stress is not well understood. In the present study, we showed that mutations in the gene coding for MnSOD (sodA) increased the toxicity of lactic acid at pH 3.5 in Streptococcus thermophilus. The inclusion of the iron chelators 2,2'-dipyridyl (DIP), diethienetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA), and O-phenanthroline (O-Phe) provided partial protection against 330 mM lactic acid at pH 3.5. The results suggested that acid stress triggers an iron-mediated oxidative stress that can be ameliorated by MnSOD and iron chelators. These findings were further validated in Escherichia coli strains lacking both MnSOD and iron SOD (FeSOD) but expressing a heterologous MnSOD from S. thermophilus. We also found that, in E. coli, FeSOD did not provide the same protection afforded by MnSOD and that hydroperoxidases are equally important in protecting the cells against acid stress. These findings may explain the ability of some microorganisms to survive better in acidified environments, as in acid foods, during fermentation and accumulation of lactic acid or during passage through the low pH of the stomach.
TI  - Bonds between fibronectin and fibronectin-binding proteins on Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Bacterial cell-wall-associated fibronectin binding proteins A and B (FnBPA and FnBPB) form bonds with host fibronectin. This binding reaction is often the initial step in prosthetic device infections. Atomic force microscopy was used to evaluate binding interactions between a fibronectin-coated probe and laboratory-derived Staphylococcus aureus that are (i) defective in both FnBPA and FnBPB (fnbA fnbB double mutant, DU5883), (ii) capable of expressing only FnBPA (fnbA fnbB double mutant complemented with pFNBA4), or (iii) capable of expressing only FnBPB (fnbA fnbB double mutant complemented with pFNBB4). These experiments were repeated using Lactococcus lactis constructs expressing fnbA and fnbB genes from S. aureus. A distinct force signature was observed for those bacteria that expressed FnBPA or FnBPB. Analysis of this force signature with the biomechanical wormlike chain model suggests that parallel bonds form between fibronectin and FnBPs on a bacterium. The strength and covalence of bonds were evaluated via nonlinear regression of force profiles. Binding events were more frequent (p < 0.01) for S. aureus expressing FnBPA or FnBPB than for the S. aureus double mutant. The binding force, frequency, and profile were similar between the FnBPA and FnBPB expressing strains of S. aureus. The absence of both FnBPs from the surface of S. aureus removed its ability to form a detectable bond with fibronectin. By contrast, ectopic expression of FnBPA or FnBPB on the surface of L. lactis conferred fibronectin binding characteristics similar to those of S. aureus. These measurements demonstrate that fibronectin-binding adhesins FnBPA and FnBPB are necessary and sufficient for the binding of S. aureus to prosthetic devices that are coated with host fibronectin.
TI  - Comparative genomics and transduction potential of Enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  - To determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of Enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin C, norfloxacin, and UV radiation. Thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction mapping. From these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. Three groups of phages, PhiFL1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with PhiFL1A to C and PhiFL2A and B sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while PhiFL3A and B share 37 to 41% identity with PhiFL1 and 2. PhiFL4A shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages PhiFL1 to 3. The PhiFL3A and B phages possess a high DNA sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. Homologs of the Streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, PblA and PblB, are encoded on each sequenced E. faecalis phage. Few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. E. faecalis JH2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in Galleria mellonella. Several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of G. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. The eight phages were tested for their ability to package host DNA, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains OG1RF and JH2-2.
TI  - Bacterial dynamics in model cheese systems, aiming at safety and quality of Portuguese-style traditional ewe's cheeses.
AB  - An experiment using model ewe's milk cheeses was designed to characterize microbial interactions that arise in actual raw milk cheese environments. These model cheeses were manufactured according to Portuguese artisanal practices, except that the microbial load and biodiversity were fully controlled: single potential pathogens and spoilage bacteria, or a combination thereof, were combined at various initial inoculum levels in sterilized raw ewe's milk with several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) normally found in traditional cheeses. Viable microbial counts were monitored throughout a 60-day ripening period. Two alternative mathematical approaches were used to fit the experimental data generated in terms of population dynamics: percent of inhibition and D-values. These were able to explain the complex competitive interactions between the contaminant microorganisms and the LAB adventitious populations. In general, the tested LAB were less able to inhibit contaminants present in combination and in higher concentrations. Lactococcus lactis, with its strong acidifying potential, was the most effective factor in controlling the unwanted bacterial population, especially single Staphylococcus aureus. The two lactobacilli studied, especially Lactobacillus brevis, were shown to be less effective; Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua were the contaminants least inhibited by the LAB.
TI  - Assessment of antimicrobial resistance transfer between lactic acid bacteria and  potential foodborne pathogens using in vitro methods and mating in a food matrix.
AB  - The transferability of antimicrobial resistance from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to potential pathogenic strains was studied using in vitro methods and mating in a food matrix. Five LAB donors containing either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance markers on transferable elements were conjugally mated with LAB (Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis) and pathogenic strains (Listeria spp., Salmonella ssp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli). In vitro transfer experiments were carried out with the donors and recipients using both the filter and plate mating methods. The food matrix consisted of fermented whole milk (fermented with the LAB donors) with the pathogenic recipients added as contaminants during the production process. All transconjugants were confirmed by phenotypic and molecular methods. Erythromycin resistance transfer from LAB strains to Listeria spp. was observed using both in vitro mating methods at high transfer frequencies of up to 5.1 x 10(-4) transconjugants per recipient. Also, high frequency transfer (ranging from 2.7 x 10(-8) up to 1.1 x 10(-3) transconjugants per recipient) of both erythromycin and tetracycline-resistance was observed between LAB species using in vitro methods. No resistance transfer was observed to Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli. The only conjugal transfer observed in the fermented milk matrix was for tetracycline resistance between two LAB strains (at a transfer frequency of 2.6 x 10(-7) transconjugants per recipients). This study demonstrates the transfer of antimicrobial resistance from LAB to Listeria spp. using in vitro methods and also the transfer of resistance between LAB species in a food matrix. It highlights the involvement of LAB as a potential source of resistance determinants that may be disseminated between LAB and pathogenic strains including Listeria spp. Furthermore, it indicates that food matrices such as fermented milks may provide a suitable environment to support gene exchange.
TI  - Efficacy of a teat dip containing the bacteriocin lacticin 3147 to eliminate Gram-positive pathogens associated with bovine mastitis.
AB  - On most dairy farms teat dips are applied to the teats of cows either before or after milking in order to prevent pathogens from gaining access to the mammary gland via the teat canal. In the present experiments, a natural teat dip was developed using a fermentate containing the live bacterium Lactococcus lactis DPC 3251. This bacterium produces lacticin 3147, a two-component lantibiotic which was previously shown to effectively kill Gram-positive mastitis pathogens. Lacticin 3147 activity in the fermentate was retained at 53% of its original level following storage for 3 weeks at 4 degrees C. In the initial experiments in vitro, 105 colony-forming units/ml (cfu/ml) of either Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae or Streptococcus uberis were introduced into the lacticin-containing fermentate. Neither Staph. aureus nor Str. dysgalactiae could be detected after 30 min or 15 min, respectively, while Str. uberis was reduced approximately 100-fold after 15 min. Following these trials, preliminary experiments were performed in vivo on teats of lactating dairy cows. In these experiments, teats were coated with each of the challenge organisms and then dipped with the lacticin-containing fermented teat dip. Following a dip contact time of 10 min, staphylococci were reduced by 80% when compared with the undipped control teat. Streptococcal challenges were reduced by 97% for Str. dysgalactiae and by 90% for Str. uberis. These trials showed that the teat dip is able to reduce mastitis pathogens on the teats of lactating cows.
TI  - Establishment of a novel anabolism-based addiction system with an artificially introduced mevalonate pathway: complete stabilization of plasmids as universal application in white biotechnology.
AB  - Plasmid stability in recombinant microorganisms is a very important requirement for highly efficient plasmid-based production processes in biotechnology. To stably maintain plasmids, we developed in this study an efficient and stringent novel anabolism-based addiction system, which can be widely used. This novel addiction system is based on two components: (i) an Escherichia coli HMS174(DE3) knockout mutant of the ispH gene coding for 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (EC 1.17.1.2) of the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) pathway, impairing the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and (ii) a completely synthetic and episomal mevalonate (MVA) pathway as an alternative supplier of essential IPP. The latter is encoded by a plasmid that contains the genes for HMG-CoA reductases from Lactococcus lactis and Staphylococcus aureus plus HMG-CoA-synthase, MVA kinase, MVP kinase and MVPP decarboxylase from S. aureus. This plasmid should then also harbor the genes for the protein or for the pathway that will be produced or that will be utilized for production of a chemical. To demonstrate the functionality of this addiction system, a mutated cyanophycin synthetase gene (cphA(6308)C595S) was used. To determine plasmid stabilities, flasks experiments in media supplied or not supplied with antibiotics were carried out with the knockout mutant and two control strains, one harboring plasmid pCOLADuet-1::MVA1-5::cphA(6308) and the other harboring a conventional expression plasmid pET-23a::cphA(6308). As revealed by measuring the colony-forming units of aliquots spread on solid media with or without antibiotics, the knockout mutant revealed a plasmid stability of 100% whereas the control strains exhibited plasmid stabilities of only 64% and 2%, respectively. Radiometric enzyme activity measurements for CphA revealed only 95% and 12.5% of the activity in the control strains harboring pCOLADuet-1::MVA1-5::cphA(6308) and pET-23a::cphA(6308), respectively, in comparison to the activity measured in the knockout mutant. The knockout mutant synthesized 9.5% (w/w of cell dry weight (CDW)) of cyanophycin, and the control strain harboring pCOLADuet-1::MVA1-5::cphA(6308) synthesized 13.6% (w/w of CDW) after growth without antibiotics.
TI  - Inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western Nigeria.
AB  - A total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from African indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. Escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by Staphylococcus spp. (20%). The Gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the Staphylococcus spp. showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. Twenty-four LAB isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic Staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. LAB strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller groups through amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Representative strains were identified as Weissella spp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16S rDNA. The Weissella spp. and L. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity against seven strains of Gram negative uropathogens. Two strains of L. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against Lactobacillus sakei. In this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west Nigeria was discovered. Based on their sensitivity to Weissella spp., there is a potential for using these LAB as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.
TI  - Lactococcus lactis expressing either Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin-binding protein A or Listeria monocytogenes internalin A can efficiently internalize and deliver DNA in human epithelial cells.
AB  - Lactococci are noninvasive bacteria frequently used as protein delivery vectors and, more recently, as in vitro and in vivo DNA delivery vehicles. We previously showed that a functional eukaryotic enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression plasmid vector was delivered in epithelial cells by Lactococcus lactis producing Listeria monocytogenes internalin A (L. lactis InlA(+)), but this strategy is limited in vivo to transgenic mice and guinea pigs. In this study, we compare the internalization ability of L. lactis InlA(+) and L. lactis producing either the fibronectin-binding protein A of Staphylococcus aureus (L. lactis FnBPA(+)) or its fibronectin binding domains C and D (L. lactis CD(+)). L. lactis FnBPA(+) and L. lactis InlA(+) showed comparable internalization rates in Caco-2 cells, while the internalization rate observed with L. lactis CD(+) was lower. As visualized by conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy, large clusters of L. lactis FnBPA(+), L. lactis CD(+), and L. lactis InlA(+) were present in the cytoplasm of Caco-2 cells after internalization. Moreover, the internalization rates of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and of an NCFM mutant strain with the gene coding for the fibronectin-binding protein (fbpA) inactivated were also evaluated in Caco-2 cells. Similar low internalization rates were observed for both wild-type L. acidophilus NCFM and the fbpA mutant, suggesting that commensal fibronectin binding proteins have a role in adhesion but not in invasion. L. lactis FnBPA(+), L. lactis CD(+), and L. lactis InlA(+) were then used to deliver a eukaryotic eGFP expression plasmid in Caco-2 cells: flow cytometry analysis showed that the highest percentage of green fluorescent Caco-2 cells was observed after coculture with either L. lactis FnBPA(+) or L. lactis InlA(+). Analysis of the in vivo efficiency of these invasive recombinant strains is currently in progress to validate their potential as DNA vaccine delivery vehicles.
TI  - Production of functionalized biopolyester granules by recombinant Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Many bacteria are naturally capable of accumulating biopolyesters composed of 3-hydroxy fatty acids as intracellular inclusions, which serve as storage granules. Recently, these inclusions have been considered as nano-/microbeads with surface-attached proteins, which can be engineered to display various protein-based functions that are suitable for biotechnological and biomedical applications. In this study, the food-grade, generally-regarded-as-safe gram-positive organism Lactococcus lactis was engineered to recombinantly produce the biopolyester poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) and the respective intracellular inclusions. The codon-optimized polyhydroxybutyrate biosynthesis operon phaCAB from Cupriavidus necator was expressed using the nisin-controlled gene expression system. Recombinant L. lactis accumulated up to 6% (wt/wt) poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) of cellular dry weight. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) granules were isolated and analyzed with respect to bound proteins using biochemical methods and with respect to shape/size using transmission electron microscopy. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding ZZ domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A was chosen as an exemplary functionality to be displayed at the granule surface by fusing it to the N terminus of the granule-associated poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) synthase. The presence of the fusion protein at the surface of isolated granules was confirmed by peptide fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (mass spectrometry). The functionality of the ZZ domain-displaying granules was demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IgG affinity purification. In both assays, the ZZ beads from recombinant L. lactis performed at least equally to ZZ beads from Escherichia coli. Overall, in this study it was shown that recombinant L. lactis can be used to manufacture endotoxin-free poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) beads with surface functionalities that are suitable for biomedical applications.
TI  - Transcriptomic response of Lactococcus lactis in mixed culture with Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The mechanisms of interaction between Lactococcus lactis and the food pathogen Staphylococcus aureus are of crucial importance, as one major role of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in fermented foods is to inhibit undesirable and pathogenic flora. It was never questioned if the presence of a pathogen can actively modify the gene expression patterns of LAB in a shared environment. In this study, transcriptome and biochemical analyses were combined to assess the dynamic response of L. lactis in a mixed culture with S. aureus. The presence of S. aureus hardly affected the growth of L. lactis but dramatically modified its gene expression profile. The main effect was related to earlier carbon limitation and a concomitantly lower growth rate in the mixed culture due to the consumption of glucose by both species. More specific responses involved diverse cellular functions. Genes associated with amino acid metabolism, ion transport, oxygen response, menaquinone metabolism, and cell surface and phage expression were differentially expressed in the mixed culture. This study led to new insights into possible mechanisms of interaction between L. lactis and S. aureus. Moreover, new and unexpected effects of L. lactis on the virulence of S. aureus were discovered, as described elsewhere (S. Even, C. Charlier, S. Nouaille, N. L. Ben Zakour, M. Cretenet, F. J. Cousin, M. Gautier, M. Cocaign-Bousquet, P. Loubiere, and Y. Le Loir, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 75:4459-4472, 2009).
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus virulence expression is impaired by Lactococcus lactis in mixed cultures.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for numerous food poisonings due to the production of enterotoxins by strains contaminating foodstuffs, especially dairy products. Several parameters, including interaction with antagonistic flora such as Lactococcus lactis, a lactic acid bacterium widely used in the dairy industry, can modulate S. aureus proliferation and virulence expression. We developed a dedicated S. aureus microarray to investigate the effect of L. lactis on staphylococcal gene expression in mixed cultures. This microarray was used to establish the transcriptomic profile of S. aureus in mixed cultures with L. lactis in a chemically defined medium held at a constant pH (6.6). Under these conditions, L. lactis hardly affected S. aureus growth. The expression of most genes involved in the cellular machinery, carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, and stress responses was only slightly modulated: a short time lag in mixed compared to pure cultures was observed. Interestingly, the induction of several virulence factors and regulators, including the agr locus, sarA, and some enterotoxins, was strongly affected. This work clearly underlines the complexity of L. lactis antagonistic potential for S. aureus and yields promising leads for investigations into nonantibiotic biocontrol of this major pathogen.
TI  - Iron-regulated surface determinant protein A mediates adhesion of Staphylococcus  aureus to human corneocyte envelope proteins.
AB  - The ability of Staphylococcus aureus to colonize the human nares is a crucial prerequisite for disease. IsdA is a major S. aureus surface protein that is expressed during human infection and required for nasal colonization and survival on human skin. In this work, we show that IsdA binds to involucrin, loricrin, and cytokeratin K10, proteins that are present in the cornified envelope of human desquamated epithelial cells. To measure the forces and dynamics of the interaction between IsdA and loricrin (the most abundant protein of the cornified envelope), single-molecule force spectroscopy was used, demonstrating high-specificity binding. IsdA acts as a cellular adhesin to the human ligands, promoting whole-cell binding to immobilized proteins, even in the absence of other S. aureus components (as shown by heterologous expression in Lactococcus lactis). Inhibition experiments revealed the binding of the human ligands to the same IsdA region. This region was mapped to the NEAT domain of IsdA. The NEAT domain also was found to be required for S. aureus whole-cell binding to the ligands as well as to human nasal cells. Thus, IsdA is an important adhesin to human ligands, which predominate in its primary ecological niche.
TI  - Contribution of (sub)domains of Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin-binding protein to the proinflammatory and procoagulant response of human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  - The Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin (Fn) -binding protein A (FnBPA) is involved in bacterium-endothelium interactions which is one of the crucial events leading to infective endocarditis (IE). We previously showed that the sole expression of S. aureus FnBPA was sufficient to confer to non-invasive Lactococcus lactis bacteria the capacity to invade human endothelial cells (ECs) and to launch the typical endothelial proinflammatory and procoagulant responses that characterize IE. In the present study we further questioned whether these bacterium-EC interactions could be reproduced by single or combined FnBPA sub-domains (A, B, C or D) using a large library of truncated FnBPA constructs expressed in L. lactis. Significant invasion of cultured ECs was found for L. lactis expressing the FnBPA subdomains CD (aa 604-877) or A4(+16) (aa 432-559). Moreover, this correlates with the capacity of these fragments to elicit in vitro a marked increase in EC surface expression of both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and secretion of the CXCL8 chemokine and finally to induce a tissue factor-dependent endothelial coagulation response. We thus conclude that (sub)domains of the staphylococcal FnBPA molecule that express Fn-binding modules, alone or in combination, are sufficient to evoke an endothelial proinflammatory as well as a procoagulant response and thus account for IE severity.
TI  - Surface expression of Helicobacter pylori urease subunit B gene E fragment on Lactococcus lactis by means of the cell wall anchor of Staphylococcus aureus protein A.
AB  - Fragment E of ureB (ureBE) was cloned from a clinical isolate of Helicobacter pylori. A prokaryotic expression vector, pAMJ399, with the ureB fragment E and the Staphylococcus aureus protein A anchor fragment (spaX), was constructed. The fusion protein was expressed under the control of the P170 promoter in Lactococcus lactis. Western blot assay of lactococcal cell wall extracts with a polyclonal chicken antiserum confirmed the immunity of the expressed recombinant protein which was located on the cell surface. These results provide the first report of a surface display system in lactic acid bacteria for the delivery of oral vaccines against Helicobacter pylori.
TI  - Surface proteins that promote adherence of Staphylococcus aureus to human desquamated nasal epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural habitat of Staphylococcus aureus is the moist squamous epithelium in the anterior nares. About 20% of the human population carry S. aureus permanently in their noses and another 60% of individuals are intermittent carriers. The ability of S. aureus to colonize the nasal epithelium is in part due to expression of surface proteins clumping factor B (ClfB) and the iron-regulated surface determinant A (IsdA), which promote adhesion to desquamated epithelial cells present in the anterior part of the nasal vestibule. S. aureus strain Newman defective in IsdA and ClfB exhibited reduced but not completely defective adherence to squamous cells in indicating that other cell surface components might also contribute. RESULTS: Surface proteins IsdA, ClfB, and the serine-aspartic acid repeat proteins SdrC, SdrD and SdrE were investigated to determine their contribution to the adherence of S. aureus to desquamated nasal epithelial cells. This was achieved by expression of ClfB, IsdA, SdrC, SdrD and SdrE on the surface of the surrogate Gram-positive host Lactococcus lactis and by isolating mutants of S. aureus Newman defective in one or more factor. The level of adherence of strains to squamous cells isolated from the nares of volunteers was measured. Results consistently showed that ClfB, IsdA, SdrC and SdrD each contributed to the ability of S. aureus to adhere to squamous cells. A mutant lacking all four proteins was completely defective in adherence. CONCLUSION: The ability of S. aureus Newman to adhere to desquamated nasal epithelial cells is multifactorial and involves SdrD and SdrC as well as ClfB and IsdA.
TI  - Cross-immunity and immune mimicry as mechanisms of resistance to the lantibiotic  lacticin 3147.
AB  - Lantibiotics are antimicrobial peptides that possess great potential as clinical  therapeutic agents. These peptides exhibit many beneficial traits and in many cases the emergence of resistance is extremely rare. In contrast, producers of lantibiotics synthesize dedicated immunity proteins to provide self-protection. These proteins have very specific activities and cross-immunity is rare. However, producers of two peptide lantibiotics, such as lacticin 3147, face the unusual challenge of exposure to two active peptides (alpha and beta). Here, in addition to establishing the contribution of LtnI and LtnFE to lacticin 3147 immunity, investigations were carried out to determine if production of a closely related lantibiotic (i.e. staphylococcin C55) or possession of LtnI/LtnFE homologues could provide protection. Here we establish that not only are staphylococcin C55 producers cross-immune to lacticin 3147, and therefore represent a natural repository of Staphylococcus aureus strains that are protected against lacticin 3147, but that functional immunity homologues are also produced by strains of Bacillus licheniformis and Enterococcus faecium. This result raises the spectre of resistance through immune mimicry, i.e. the emergence of lantibiotic-resistant strains from the environment resulting from the possession/acquisition of immunity gene homologues. These phenomena will have to be considered carefully when developing lantibiotics for clinical application.
TI  - Multidrug transport by the ABC transporter Sav1866 from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Sav1866 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein from the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and is a homologue of bacterial and human multidrug ABC transporters. Recently, the three-dimensional crystal structure of Sav1866 was determined at 3.0 A resolution [Dawson, R. J., and Locher, K. P. (2006) Nature 443, 180-185]. Although this structure is frequently used to homology model human and microbial ABC multidrug transporters by computational methods, the ability of Sav1866 to transport multiple drugs has not been described. We obtained functional expression of Sav1866 in the drug-sensitive, Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis Delta lmrA Delta lmrCD lacking major endogenous multidrug transporters. Sav1866 displayed a Hoechst 33342, verapamil, tetraphenylphosphonium, and vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity. In growing cells, Sav1866 expression conferred resistance to Hoechst 33342. In transport assays in intact cells, Sav1866 catalyzed the translocation of amphiphilic cationic ethidium. Additionally, Sav1866 mediated the active transport of Hoechst 33342 in membrane vesicles and proteoliposomes containing purified and functionally reconstituted protein. Sav1866-mediated resistance and transport were inhibited by the human ABCB1 and ABCC1 modulator verapamil. This work represents the first demonstration of multidrug transport by Sav1866 and suggests that Sav1866 can serve as a well-defined model for studies on the molecular bases of drug-protein interactions in ABC transporters. Our methods for the overexpression, purification, and functional reconstitution of Sav1866 are described in detail.
TI  - The fibrinogen- and fibronectin-binding domains of Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin-binding protein A synergistically promote endothelial invasion and experimental endocarditis.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus experimental endocarditis relies on sequential fibrinogen binding (for valve colonization) and fibronectin binding (for endothelial invasion) conferred by peptidoglycan-attached adhesins. Fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA) reconciles these two properties--as well as elastin binding--and promotes experimental endocarditis by itself. Here we attempted to delineate the minimal subdomain of FnBPA responsible for fibrinogen and fibronectin binding, cell invasion, and in vivo endocarditis. A large library of truncated constructs of FnBPA was expressed in Lactococcus lactis and tested in vitro and in animals. A 127-amino-acid subdomain spanning the hinge of the FnBPA fibrinogen-binding and fibronectin-binding regions appeared necessary and sufficient to confer the sum of these properties. Competition with synthetic peptides could not delineate specific fibrinogen- and fibronectin-binding sites, suggesting that dual binding arose from protein folding, irrespective of clearly defined binding domains. Moreover, coexpressing the 127-amino-acid subdomain with remote domains of FnBPA further increased fibrinogen binding by > or =10 times, confirming the importance of domain interactions for binding efficacy. In animals, fibrinogen binding (but not fibronectin binding) was significantly associated with endocarditis induction, whereas both fibrinogen binding and fibronectin binding were associated with disease severity. Moreover, fibrinogen binding also combined with fibronectin binding to synergize the invasion of cultured cell lines significantly, a feature correlating with endocarditis severity. Thus, while fibrinogen binding and fibronectin binding were believed to act sequentially in colonization and invasion, they appeared unexpectedly intertwined in terms of both functional anatomy and pathogenicity (in endocarditis). This unforeseen FnBPA subtlety might bear importance for the development of antiadhesin strategies.
TI  - [Construction of a food-grade secretion expression vector and use it for reporter protein expression in Lactococcus lactis].
AB  - We constructed a food-grade secretion expression vector and used it for reporter  protein expression in live delivery vehicle L lactis MBP71. The p32 fragment, which containing the stronger p32 promoter, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the plasmid pMG36e as template. After being purified, the p32 fragment was ligated with SPusp45 fragment amplified from genomic DNA of L lactis MG1363. The fusion fragment p32-SPusp45 was inserted into the food-grade vector pSH91 to construct a secretion expression vector, pSQ. The coding sequence of NucA (nucA) was also amplified from Staphylococcus aureus chromosome and inserted into pSQ under the control of p32 promoter to construct a recombinant plasmid pSQ-nucA. Nuclease plate activity assay and zymograme assay demonstrate that NucA was secretion expressed from L lactis harboring the recombinant plasmid pSQ- nucA, and the quantity of NucA secreted into supernamant was about ten times more than which in cell lysate. Results also indicate that expression efficiency of L lactis/pSQ-nucA was higher than that of L lactis/pSQZ-nucA, constructed by us earlier.
TI  - Effect of Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecalis on the behaviour of Staphylococcus aureus in microfiltered milk.
AB  - The effect of four strains of Lactococcus garvieae, three strains of Lactococcus  lactis and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis on Staphylococcus aureus SA15 growth in microfiltered milk was evaluated. Lactococcus and Enterococcus strains were co-cultured with S. aureus in microfiltered milk and in medium buffered at pH 6.8. All Lactococcus and Enterococcus strains were able to inhibit S. aureus growth after 6h of incubation. Inhibition by L. lactis and E. faecalis strains could be partially attributed to the decrease in pH below 6.0 as it has been observed in medium buffered at pH 6.8. L. garvieae strains were the most effective to inhibit S. aureus growth without acidification. Inhibition of S. aureus could not be attributed neither to production of lactate, acetate or nor to antistaphylococcal substance. Amino acids competition was not involved in the inhibition by L. garvieae as addition of valine, isoleucine, threonine, methionine and phenylalanine did not suppress the inhibition of S. aureus.
TI  - Identification of the Staphylococcus aureus MSCRAMM clumping factor B (ClfB) binding site in the alphaC-domain of human fibrinogen.
AB  - Clumping factor B (ClfB) of Staphylococcus aureus binds to cytokeratin 10 and to  fibrinogen. In this study the binding site in human fibrinogen was localized to a short region within the C terminus of the Aalpha-chain. ClfB only bound to the Aalpha-chain of fibrinogen in a ligand-affinity blot and in solid-phase assays with purified recombinant fibrinogen chains. A variant of fibrinogen with wild-type Bbeta- and gamma-chains but with a deletion that lacked the C-terminal residues from 252-610 of the Aalpha-chain did not support adherence of S. aureus Newman expressing ClfB. A series of truncated mutants of the recombinant Aalpha-chain were tested for their ability to support adherence of S. aureus Newman ClfB(+), which allowed the binding site to be localized to a short segment of the unfolded flexible repeated sequence within the C terminus of the Aalpha-chain. This was confirmed by two amino acid substititions within repeat 5 of the recombinant Aalpha-chain which did not support adherence of Newman ClfB(+). Lactococcus lactis expressing ClfB mutants with amino acid substitutions (N256 and Q235) located in the putative ligand-binding trench between domains N2 and N3 of the A-domain were defective in adherence to immobilized fibrinogen and cytokeratin 10, suggesting that both ligands bind to the same or overlapping regions.
TI  - Bioprotection of Golden Delicious apples and Iceberg lettuce against foodborne bacterial pathogens by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fresh vegetables and fruit and its ability to inhibit the growth of foodborne human pathogens (Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) was tested using the agar spot assay. Eighteen isolates showed a strong antagonistic capacity and were further characterised and identified using 16S rDNA sequencing and API 50CH. Most of them pertained to Leuconostoc spp. and Lactobacillus plantarum, and a few corresponded to Weissella spp. and Lactococcus lactis. Growth and efficacy of control of foodborne pathogen test bacteria by selected strains were tested in wounded Golden Delicious apples and Iceberg lettuce leaf cuts. The strains grew on the substrates and did not cause negative effects on the general aspect of tissues of apple or lettuce. Treatment of apple wounds and lettuce cuts with the antagonistic strains reduced the cell count of S. typhimurium and E .coli by 1 to 2 log cfu/wound or g, whereas the growth of L. monocytogenes was completely inhibited. Results support the potential use of lactic acid bacteria as bioprotective agents against foodborne human pathogens in ready-to-eat fresh fruit and vegetable products.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of flavonoids extracted from bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso) peel, a byproduct of the essential oil industry.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the antimicrobial properties of flavonoid-rich fractions derived from bergamot peel, a byproduct from the Citrus fruit processing industry and the influence of enzymatic deglycosylation on their activity against different bacteria and yeast. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bergamot ethanolic fractions were tested against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Salmonella enterica), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria innocua, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis) and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Bergamot fractions were found to be active against all the Gram-negative bacteria tested, and their antimicrobial potency increased after enzymatic deglycosylation. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the fractions and the pure flavonoids, neohesperidin, hesperetin (aglycone), neoeriocitrin, eriodictyol (aglycone), naringin and naringenin (aglycone), were found to be in the range 200 to 800 microg ml(-1). The interactions between three bergamot flavonoids were also evaluated. CONCLUSION: The enzyme preparation Pectinase 62L efficiently converted common glycosides into their aglycones from bergamot extracts, and this deglycosylation increased the antimicrobial potency of Citrus flavonoids. Pairwise combinations of eriodictyol, naringenin and hesperetin showed both synergistic and indifferent interactions that were dependent on the test indicator organism. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bergamot peel is a potential source of natural antimicrobials that are active against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of the structural gene encoding nisin F, a new lantibiotic produced by a Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate from freshwater catfish (Clarias gariepinus).
AB  - Lactococcus lactis F10, isolated from freshwater catfish, produces a bacteriocin  (BacF) active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus carnosus, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri. The operon encoding BacF is located on a plasmid. Sequencing of the structural gene revealed no homology to other nisin genes. Nisin F is described.
TI  - Production of nisin Z by Lactococcus lactis isolated from dahi.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis CM1, an isolate from homemade "Dahi," a traditional fermented  milk from India, used maltose as carbon source to produce a high level of bacteriocin. The bacterial cell mass and the bacteriocin production correlated with the initial pH of the medium and were highest when the initial pH was 11.0. The level of bacteriocin reached its peak at the late log phase with concomitant reduction of culture pH to 4.2, regardless of the initial pH of the medium. A combination of maltose and an initial medium pH of 11 resulted in the highest bacteriocin production. The antibacterial spectrum of the bacteriocin was closely similar to that of nisin and it inhibited a number of food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the compound migrated close to the position of nisin (3.5 kDa). However, it had higher stability than nisin at a wide range of pH and temperature. PCR amplification using nisin gene-specific primers and sequencing of the amplified DNA revealed the structural gene for the bacteriocin to be identical to that of nisZ.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Characterization and structure analysis of a novel bacteriocin, lacticin Z, produced by Lactococcus lactis QU 14.
AB  - A novel bacteriocin, lacticin Z, produced by Lactococcus lactis QU 14 isolated from a horse's intestinal tract was identified. Lacticin Z was purified through a three step procedure comprised of hydrophobic-interaction, cation-exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase HPLC. ESI-TOF MS determined the molecular mass of lacticin Z to be 5,968.9 Da. The primary structure of lacticin Z was found to consist of 53 amino acid residues without any leader sequence or signal peptide. Lacticin Z showed homology to lacticin Q from L. lactis QU 5, aureocin A53 from Staphylococcus aureus A53, and mutacin BHT-B from Streptococcus rattus strain BHT. It exhibited a nanomolar range of MICs against various Gram-positive bacteria, and the activity was completely stable up to 100 degrees C. Unlike many of other LAB bacteriocins, the stability of lacticin Z was emphasized under alkaline conditions rather than acidic conditions. All the results indicated that lacticin Z belongs to a novel type of bacteriocin.
TI  - Efficacy of nisin in treatment of clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  - Nisin is an antimicrobial polypeptide produced by Lactococcus lactis and is believed nontoxic to humans. The objective of this study was to evaluate a nisin-based formulation for the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cattle. A total of 92 cows with 107 clinically mastitic quarters were randomly assigned to nisin- (48 cows with 51 quarters) and gentamicin (GM)-treated (44 cows with 56 quarters) groups. In the nisin-treated group, cows received an intramammary infusion of nisin at a dose of 2,500,000 IU; in the GM-treated group, intramammary infusion of GM was administered at a dose of 0.8 g. Results indicated that nisin offered a clinical cure rate similar to GM (90.2 vs. 91.1%) and no difference in bacteriological cure rate than GM-treated group (60.8 vs. 44.6%, respectively). Proportion of the quarters with milk somatic cell counts <500,000 cells/mL was not different in the nisin-treated group (50.0 and 47.8%) compared with the GM-treated group (33.3 and 37.3%) 1 and 2 wk after treatment. Of 17 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 82.5% were resistant to penicillin, and 35.3% to GM, but none of them to nisin. Nisin therapy eliminated 54.5% (6 of 11) of S. aureus IMI, whereas GM eliminated 33.3% (2 of 6). Nisin in milk (4.5 +/- 0.8 IU/mL) was detected only at 12 h following intramammary infusion, which was much lower than the upper limit (500 mg/mL) allowed as preservative in milk by the China authority. Because of its efficacy in the treatment of bovine clinical mastitis, especially resistant Staph. aureus-caused IMI, as well as its safety in humans, nisin deserves further study to clarify its effects on mastitis caused by different mastitis pathogens on a larger scale.
TI  - New structure model for the ATP-binding cassette multidrug transporter LmrA.
AB  - Multidrug resistance of pathogenic microorganisms and mammalian tumors can be associated with the overexpression of multidrug transporters. These integral membrane proteins are capable of extruding a wide range of structurally unrelated compounds from the cell. Among the different classes of multidrug transporters are the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which are dependent on the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. In the past five years, many researchers have built homology models of ABC extrusion systems using the atomic coordinates of crystallized MsbA, a lipopolysaccharide transporter in Gram-negative bacteria. Likewise, we have previously used the Vibrio cholera MsbA structure as a template in the modeling of the multidrug transporter LmrA from Lactococcus lactis. In view of the recently discovered inaccuracies in the MsbA structure, we have remodelled LmrA using the atomic coordinates of the MsbA homologue Sav1866 from Staphylococcus aureus. To compare and test our MsbA-based and Sav1866-based LmrA models we performed cysteine cross-linking at three key positions in LmrA. The pattern of cross-linking at these positions was consistent with the overall topology of transmembrane helices in Sav1866, suggesting that its crystal structure might be physiologically relevant. We recently identified E314 as a residue important in proton conduction by LmrA. The predicted location of this residue at the interface between the two half-transporters in the Sav1866-based homodimer, within the inner leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer, provides a new structural basis for the role of E314 in LmrA-mediated transport.
TI  - Role of a qnr-like gene in the intrinsic resistance of Enterococcus faecalis to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - Fluoroquinolones are poorly active against enterococci. Recently, plasmid-borne resistance to fluoroquinolones due to the qnr gene was reported in members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The gene encodes a pentapeptide repeat protein that protects DNA gyrase from inhibition by fluoroquinolones. We have identified in the genome of Enterococcus faecalis V583 a qnr-like gene, named E. faecalis qnr (qnr(E. faecalis)), encoding a putative pentapeptide repeat protein that shares 25% identity with Qnr. To assess its potential role in the intrinsic resistance of E. faecalis to fluoroquinolones, qnr(E. faecalis) was inactivated in E. faecalis JH2-2 by insertion of the thermosensitive vector pG1KT. This strain was then complemented with qnr(E. faecalis) cloned in the multicopy plasmid pORI23. The effects of its overexpression were also studied. Inactivation of the qnr(E. faecalis) gene resulted in twofold decreases in the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. When the gene was complemented or overexpressed, MICs of fluoroquinolones increased four- to nine-fold, leading to MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin equal to 32 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively. The E. faecalis Qnr (Qnr(E. faecalis)) protein was produced and purified. Qnr(E. faecalis) protein protected Escherichia coli DNA gyrase from inhibition by ofloxacin. The qnr(E. faecalis) gene was then introduced into E. coli DH10B, Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, and Lactococcus lactis IL-1419 to study its heterologous expression. MICs of the various fluoroquinolones tested increased 4- to 16-fold, showing that Qnr(E. faecalis) conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones in various bacterial backgrounds. Overexpression of qnr(E. faecalis) in enterococci or mobilization of the gene to other bacterial species may be anticipated as a possible new mechanism for fluoroquinolone resistance.
TI  - Selection of probiotic bacteria for prevention of allergic diseases: immunomodulation of neonatal dendritic cells.
AB  - Modification of intestinal microbiota early in life by administration of probiotic bacteria may be a potential approach to prevent allergic disease. To select probiotic bacteria for in vivo purposes, we investigated the capacity of probiotic bacteria to interact with neonatal dendritic cells (DC) and studied the ensuing T cell polarizing effect. Immature DC were generated from cord blood-derived monocytes and maturation was induced by maturation factors (MF), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus MF and Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. infantis, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactococcus lactis alone or combined with MF. After 12 days of co-culture with DC and Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB) as antigenic stimulus, cytokine production by autologous T cells was determined by intracellular cytokine staining. Additionally, cells were stimulated with CD3 and CD28 monoclonal antibodies and cytokines were measured in supernatants by multiplex assay. The probiotic strains induced partial maturation of DC. Full maturation of DC was induced for all strains tested when MF was added. The percentage of interleukin (IL)-4 producing T cells was lower in T cell cultures stimulated with B. bifidum matured DC compared to MF and LPS matured DC, which coincided with a higher percentage of interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing T cells. Furthermore, T cells stimulated by B. bifidum matured DC produced significantly more IL-10 compared to MF matured DC. Selected species of the Bifidobacterium genus prime in vitro cultured neonatal DC to polarize T cell responses and may therefore be candidates to use in primary prevention of allergic diseases.
TI  - SdrF, a Staphylococcus epidermidis surface protein, binds type I collagen.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is the leading cause of device-related infections. These infections require an initial colonization step in which S. epidermidis adheres to the implanted material. This process is usually mediated by specific bacterial surface proteins and host factors coating the foreign device. Some of these surface proteins belong to the serine-aspartate repeat (Sdr) family, which includes adhesins from Staphyloccus aureus and S. epidermidis. Using a heterologous expression system in Lactococcus lactis to overcome possible staphylococcal adherence redundancy we observed that one of these Sdr proteins, SdrF, mediates binding to type I collagen when present on the lactococcal cell surface. We used lactococcal recombinant strains, a protein-protein interaction assay and Western ligand blot analysis to demonstrate that this process occurs via the B domain of SdrF and both the alpha1 and alpha2 chains of type I collagen. It was also found that a single B domain repeat of S. epidermidis 9491 retains the capacity to bind to type I collagen. We demonstrated that the putative ligand binding N-terminal A domain does not bind to collagen which suggests that SdrF might be a multiligand adhesin. Antibodies directed against the B domain significantly reduce in vitro adherence of S. epidermidis to immobilized collagen.
TI  - Toward the automated generation of genome-scale metabolic networks in the SEED.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current methods for the automated generation of genome-scale metabolic networks focus on genome annotation and preliminary biochemical reaction network assembly, but do not adequately address the process of identifying and filling gaps in the reaction network, and verifying that the network is suitable for systems level analysis. Thus, current methods are only sufficient for generating draft-quality networks, and refinement of the reaction network is still largely a manual, labor-intensive process. RESULTS: We have developed a method for generating genome-scale metabolic networks that produces substantially complete reaction networks, suitable for systems level analysis. Our method partitions the reaction space of central and intermediary metabolism into discrete, interconnected components that can be assembled and verified in isolation from each other, and then integrated and verified at the level of their interconnectivity. We have developed a database of components that are common across organisms, and have created tools for automatically assembling appropriate components for a particular organism based on the metabolic pathways encoded in the organism's genome. This focuses manual efforts on that portion of an organism's metabolism that is not yet represented in the database. We have demonstrated the efficacy of our method by reverse-engineering and automatically regenerating the reaction network from a published genome-scale metabolic model for Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, we have verified that our method capitalizes on the database of common reaction network components created for S. aureus, by using these components to generate substantially complete reconstructions of the reaction networks from three other published metabolic models (Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Lactococcus lactis). We have implemented our tools and database within the SEED, an open-source software environment for comparative genome annotation and analysis. CONCLUSION: Our method sets the stage for the automated generation of substantially complete metabolic networks for over 400 complete genome sequences currently in the SEED. With each genome that is processed using our tools, the database of common components grows to cover more of the diversity of metabolic pathways. This increases the likelihood that components of reaction networks for subsequently processed genomes can be retrieved from the database, rather than assembled and verified manually.
TI  - Both complement- and fibrinogen-dependent mechanisms contribute to platelet aggregation mediated by Staphylococcus aureus clumping factor B.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus can stimulate activation and aggregation of platelets, which are thought to be factors in the development of infective endocarditis. Previous studies have identified clumping factor A (ClfA) and fibronectin binding proteins A and B (FnBPA and FnBPB) as potent platelet aggregators. These proteins are able to stimulate rapid platelet aggregation by either a fibrinogen- or a fibronectin-dependent process which also requires antibodies specific to each protein. Slower aggregation has been seen in other systems where specific fibrinogen binding ligands are absent and platelet aggregation is mediated by complement and specific antibodies. Bacteria expressing ClfB aggregate platelets with a longer lag time than ClfA or FnBPA and FnBPB. In order to investigate whether ClfB causes platelet aggregation in a complement- or fibrinogen-dependent manner, a non-fibrinogen-binding mutant of ClfB (ClfB Q235A) was constructed. Lactococcus lactis expressing ClfB Q235A was able to stimulate platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma without a significant increase in lag time. The requirements for platelet aggregation were investigated using gel-filtered platelets. Fibrinogen and specific anti-ClfB antibodies were found to be sufficient to allow platelet aggregation mediated by the wild-type ClfB protein. It seems that ClfB causes platelet aggregation by a fibrinogen-dependent mechanism. The non-fibrinogen-binding ClfB mutant was unable to stimulate platelet aggregation under these conditions. However, bacteria expressing ClfB Q235A caused platelet aggregation in a complement-dependent manner which required specific anti-ClfB antibodies.
TI  - Relatedness between the two-component lantibiotics lacticin 3147 and staphylococcin C55 based on structure, genetics and biological activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two component lantibiotics, such as the plasmid-encoded lacticin 3147 produced by Lactococcus lactis DPC3147 and staphylococcin C55 produced by Staphylococcus aureus C55, represent an emerging subgroup of bacteriocins. These two bacteriocins are particularly closely related, exhibiting 86% (LtnA1 and C55alpha) and 55% (LtnA2 and C55beta) identity in their component peptides. The aim of this study was to investigate, for the first time for any two component bacteriocins, the significance of the relatedness between these two systems. RESULTS: So close is this relatedness that the hybrid peptide pairs LtnA1:C55beta and C55alpha:LtnA2 were found to have activities in the single nanomolar range, comparing well with the native pairings. To determine whether this flexibility extended to the associated post-translational modification/processing machinery, the staphylococcin C55 structural genes were directly substituted for their lacticin 3147 counterparts in the ltn operon on the large conjugative lactococcal plasmid pMRC01. It was established that the lacticin LtnA1 post-translational and processing machinery could produce functionally active C55alpha, but not C55beta. In order to investigate in closer detail the significance of the differences between LtnA1 and C55alpha, three residues in LtnA1 were replaced with the equivalent residues in C55alpha. Surprisingly, one such mutant LtnA1-Leu21Ala was not produced. This may be significant given the positioning of this residue in a putative lipid II binding loop. CONCLUSION: It is apparent, despite sharing striking similarities in terms of structure and activity, that these two complex bacteriocins display some highly dedicated features particular to either system.
TI  - Fibronectin-binding proteins and clumping factor A in Staphylococcus aureus experimental endocarditis: FnBPA is sufficient to activate human endothelial cells.
AB  - Surface molecules of Staphylococcus aureus are involved in the colonization of vascular endothelium which is a crucial primary event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis (IE). The ability of these molecules to also launch endothelial procoagulant and proinflammatory responses, which characterize IE, is not known. In the present study we investigated the individual capacities of three prominent S. aureus surface molecules; fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA) and B (FnBPB) and clumping factor A (ClfA), to promote bacterial adherence to cultured human endothelial cells (ECs) and to activate phenotypic and functional changes in these ECs. Non-invasive surrogate bacterium Lactococcus lactis, which, by gene transfer, expressed staphylococcal FnBPA, FnBPB or ClfA molecules were used. Infection of ECs increased 50- to 100-fold with FnBPA- or FnBPB-positive recombinant lactococci. This coincided with EC activation, interleukin-8 secretion and surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and concomitant monocyte adhesion. Infection with ClfA-positive lactococci did not activate EC. FnBPA-positive L. lactis also induced a prominent tissue factor-dependent endothelial coagulation response that was intensified by cell-bound monocytes. Thus S. aureus FnBPs, but not ClfA, confer invasiveness and pathogenicity to non-pathogenic L. lactis organisms indicating that bacterium-EC interactions mediated by these adhesins are sufficient to evoke inflammation as well as procoagulant activity at infected endovascular sites.
TI  - Structural analysis and characterization of lacticin Q, a novel bacteriocin belonging to a new family of unmodified bacteriocins of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis QU 5 isolated from corn produces a novel bacteriocin, termed lacticin Q. By acetone precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, lacticin Q was purified from the culture supernatant of this organism, and its molecular mass was determined to be 5,926.50 Da by mass spectrometry. Subsequent analyses of amino acid and DNA sequences revealed that lacticin Q comprised 53 amino acid residues and that its N-terminal methionine residue was formylated. In contrast to most bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria, lacticin Q had no N-terminal extensions such as leader or signal sequences. It showed 66% and 48% identity to AucA, a hypothetical protein from Corynebacterium jeikeium plasmid pA501, and aureocin A53, a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus A53, respectively. The characteristics of lacticin Q were determined and compared to those of nisin A. Similar to nisin A, lacticin Q exhibited antibacterial activity against various gram-positive bacteria. Lacticin Q was very stable against heat treatment and changes in pH; in particular, it was stable at alkaline pH values, while nisin A was inactivated. Moreover, lacticin Q induced ATP efflux from a Listeria sp. strain in a shorter time and at a lower concentration than nisin A, indicating that the former affected indicator cells in a different manner from that of the latter. The results described here clarified the fact that lacticin Q belongs to a new family of class II bacteriocins and that it can be employed as an alternative to or in combination with nisin A.
TI  - Amino acid and nucleotide sequence, adjacent genes, and heterologous expression of hiracin JM79, a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus hirae DCH5, isolated from Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).
AB  - The primary structure of a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus hirae DCH5 was determined by combined amino acid and DNA sequencing. Nucleotide analysis of a 2838-bp DNA fragment of E. hirae DCH5 revealed five putative ORFs. The first orf (hirJM79) encodes a 74-amino-acid peptide containing an N-terminal signal peptide of 30 amino acids, followed by the amino acid sequence of the mature bacteriocin, hiracin JM79 (HirJM79), of 44 amino acids. The second orf (hiriJM79) encodes the putative immunity protein of HirJM79. Contiguous ORFs encode a putative mobilization protein (orfC), a relaxase/mobilization nuclease domain (orfD), and a hypothetical protein (orfE). The production and functional expression of HirJM79 by heterologous hosts suggest that hirJM79 is the minimum requirement for production of biologically active HirJM79, that HirJM79 is most likely externalized by the general secretory pathway or sec-dependent pathway, and that HiriJM79 is the immunity protein for HirJM79.
TI  - Single-molecule force spectroscopy and imaging of the vancomycin/D-Ala-D-Ala interaction.
AB  - The clinically important vancomycin antibiotic inhibits the growth of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus by blocking cell wall synthesis through specific recognition of nascent peptidoglycan terminating in D-Ala-D-Ala. Here, we demonstrate the ability of single-molecule atomic force microscopy with antibiotic-modified tips to measure the specific binding forces of vancomycin and to map individual ligands on living bacteria. The single-molecule approach presented here provides new opportunities for understanding the binding mechanisms of antibiotics and for exploring the architecture of bacterial cell walls.
TI  - Fibrinogen and elastin bind to the same region within the A domain of fibronectin binding protein A, an MSCRAMM of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The fibronectin binding protein, FnBPA, is a multifunctional microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecule (MSCRAMM) that promotes bacterial adherence to immobilized fibrinogen and elastin via the N-terminal A domain. The binding site for fibrinogen and elastin was localized to subdomains N2N3. A three-dimensional structural model of FnBPA was created based on the known crystal structure of the domains N2N3 of clumping factor A (ClfA). The role of individual residues in the putative ligand binding trench was examined by testing the affinity of mutants for fibrinogen and elastin. Two residues (N304 and F306) were crucial for binding both ligands and are in the equivalent positions to residues known to be important for fibrinogen binding by ClfA. A peptide comprising the C-terminus of the gamma-chain of fibrinogen and a monoclonal anti-rAFnBPA antibody were potent inhibitors of the FnBPA-elastin interaction. This suggests that FnBPA binds to fibrinogen and elastin in a similar manner. Amino acid sequence divergence of 26.5% occurred between the A domains of FnBPA from strains 8325-4 and P1. Most variant residues were predicted to be located on the surface of domains N2N3 while few occurred in the putative ligand binding trench and the latching peptide explaining limited immunocross reactivity while ligand binding activity is conserved.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic diversity of Lactococcus lactis isolates from Batzos, a  Greek PDO raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - The genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 Lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of Batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. According to PFGE data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the L. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. Plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. Twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. There was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to PFGE. Clustering of strains according to RAPD-PCR was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and PFGE for the majority of the strains. In addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the season of cheese production. All strains inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Their ability to affect the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. In 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. The 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher Lys- than Leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher Leu- than Lys-aminopeptidase activity. Their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. The majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. These results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from Batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.
TI  - Shunt infection: is there a near-miss scenario?
AB  - OBJECT: The aim of this study was to establish whether microbiological contamination at the time of shunt insertion can be detected and used to predict the likelihood of subsequent shunt infection. METHODS: A prospective study of pediatric patients undergoing primary shunt insertion was undertaken. Following the protocol devised for this study, three swab samples were collected from the surgical wounds during each procedure. These samples were incubated and subcultured, and the isolates were identified and stored. In patients who subsequently presented with clinical evidence of shunt infection, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analyzed using microscopy, tissue cultures, and sensitivity testing. The organisms isolated at the time of shunt insertion and those responsible for subsequent shunt infection were then compared. The study population consisted of 107 pediatric patients. Because one patient underwent placement of an additional contralateral shunt system, there were 108 total shunt insertions yielding 325 swab samples. Organisms were identified in cultures of 50 swab samples (15%) obtained in 40 patients (37%). In seven of these 40 patients (17.5%) a CSF infection subsequently developed. In only one patient was the infectious organism the same as that isolated from the swab specimens. In an additional six patients (8.8%) a CSF infection occurred despite the lack of growth in the cultures from intraoperative swab samples. CONCLUSIONS: The organisms responsible for shunt infection were rarely detected in the operative wound at the time of shunt insertion, leading the authors to conclude that the vulnerable period for bacterial colonization of shunts may not be restricted to the operative procedure as is commonly believed, but may extend throughout the postoperative period of wound healing. These findings have implications not only for a better understanding of the cause of shunt infections but also for the development of strategies to prevent them.
TI  - Human lysozyme expressed in the mammary gland of transgenic dairy goats can inhibit the growth of bacteria that cause mastitis and the cold-spoilage of milk.
AB  - The addition of human milk components with intrinsic antimicrobial activity to livestock milk by genetic engineering has the potential to benefit milk safety and production as well as the health of the lactating animal. As a model for the dairy cow, we generated transgenic goats that expressed human lysozyme in their milk at 68% of the levels found in human milk. Milk from these transgenic animals had a bacteriostatic effect on both in vitro and in vivo growth of several microorganisms important to the dairy industry. In vitro, milk from transgenic animals was capable of slowing the growth of mastitis-causing strains of Escherichia coli (P < 0.02) and Staphylococcus aureus (P < 0.05) as well as the cold-spoilage organism Pseudomonas fragi (P < 0.02). The growth of an organism involved in cheese-making, Lactococcus lactis, was not affected by the presence of lysozyme in milk. The supplementation of control milk with purified lysozyme did not achieve the same inhibitory effect as milk from transgenic animals. In vivo, milk from transgenic animals supported less bacterial growth than control milk. This transgenic model demonstrates the possibilities offered by genetic engineering to enhance the antimicrobial nature of milk and the udder.
TI  - Partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by human Lactococcus lactis and Pediococccus acidilactici isolates.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from human intestine. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 111 LAB were isolated from human adult stool and screened for their bacteriocin production. Neutralized cell-free supernatants from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MM19 and Pediococcus acidilactici MM33 showed antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobials in the supernatant from a culture of L. lactis inhibited Enterococcus faecium, various species of Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus aureus; while those in the supernatant from a culture of P. acidilactici inhibited Enterococcus spp., some lactobacilli and various serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes. The antimicrobial metabolites were heat-stable and were active over a pH range of 2-10. The antimicrobial activities of the supernatants of both bacteria were inhibited by many proteases but not by catalase. The plate overlay assay allowed an approximation of size between 3.5 and 6 kDa for both antimicrobial substances. CONCLUSIONS: As the antagonistic factor(s) produced by L. lactis MM19 and P. acidilactici MM33 were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, it could be hypothesized that bacteriocins were involved in the inhibitory activities. Inhibition spectrum and biochemical analysis showed that these bacteria produced two distinct bacteriocins. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We are the first to isolate bacteriocin-producing strains of Pediococcus and Lactococcus from human intestine. These strains might be useful for control of enteric pathogens.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Isolation and identification of a Paenibacillus polymyxa strain that coproduces a novel lantibiotic and polymyxin.
AB  - A new bacterial strain, displaying potent antimicrobial properties against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, was isolated from food. Based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties as well as its 16S rRNA gene sequence, the bacterium was identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa and it was designated as strain OSY-DF. The antimicrobials produced by this strain were isolated from the fermentation broth and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two antimicrobials were found: a known antibiotic, polymyxin E1, which is active against gram-negative bacteria, and an unknown 2,983-Da compound showing activity against gram-positive bacteria. The latter was purified to homogeneity, and its antimicrobial potency and proteinaceous nature were confirmed. The antimicrobial peptide, designated paenibacillin, is active against a broad range of food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, including Bacillus spp., Clostridium sporogenes, Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Listeria spp., Pediococcus cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Furthermore, it possesses the physico-chemical properties of an ideal antimicrobial agent in terms of water solubility, thermal resistance, and stability against acid/alkali (pH 2.0 to 9.0) treatment. Edman degradation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to sequence native and chemically modified paenibacillin. While details of the tentative sequence need to be elucidated in future work, the peptide was unequivocally characterized as a novel lantibiotic, with a high degree of posttranslational modifications. The coproduction of polymyxin E1 and a lantibiotic is a finding that has not been reported earlier. The new strain and associated peptide are potentially useful in food and medical applications.
TI  - Potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from specific natural niches in food production and preservation.
AB  - Autochthonous strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been isolated from traditionally homemade cheeses collected from specific ecological localities across Serbia and Montenegro. Genetic and biochemical analysis of this LAB revealed that they produce bacteriocins, proteinases and exopolysaccharides. LAB produces a variety of antimicrobial substances with potential importance for food fermentation and preservation. Apart from the metabolic end products, some strains also secrete antimicrobial substances known as bacteriocins. Among the natural isolates of LAB from homemade cheeses, bacteriocin producers were found in both lactococci and lactobacilli. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis BGMN1-5 was found to produce three narrow spectrum class II heat-stable bacteriocins. In addition to bacteriocin production, BGMN1-5 synthesized a cell envelope-associated proteinase (CEP) and shows an aggregation phenotype. Another isolate, L. lactis subsp. lactis BGSM1-19 produces low molecular mass (7 kDa) bacteriocin SM19 that showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus flavus and partially against Salmonella paratyphi. Production of bacteriocin reaches a plateau after 8 h of BGSM1-19 growth. Bacteriocin SM19 retained activity within the wide pH range from 1 to 12 and after the treatment at 100 degrees C for 15 min. Among collection of lactobacilli, the isolate Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGSJ2-8 produces heat-stable bacteriocin SJ (approx. 5 kDa) polypeptide. It retained activity after treatment for 1 h at 100 degrees C, and in the pH range from 2 to 11. In addition to isolates from cheeses, bacteriocin-producing human oral lactobacilli were detected. Most of them showed antimicrobial activity against streptococci, staphylococci and micrococci, but not against Candida. Isolate BGHO1 that showed the highest antimicrobial activity was determined as L. paracasei. Interestingly, Lactobacillus helveticus BGRA43, which was isolated from the human intestine showed strong activity against Clostridium sporogenes, but it was not possible to detect any bacteriocin production in this isolate by using standard procedures. Further analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that BGRA43 has a relatively broad spectrum. Lactobacilli resistant to nisin were also detected among natural isolates. They produce bacteriocins, which have no activity against nisin producing lactococci.
TI  - Use of targetrons to disrupt essential and nonessential genes in Staphylococcus aureus reveals temperature sensitivity of Ll.LtrB group II intron splicing.
AB  - We show that a targetron based on the Lactococcus lactis Ll.LtrB group II intron  can be used for efficient chromosomal gene disruption in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Targetrons expressed from derivatives of vector pCN37, which uses a cadmium-inducible promoter, or pCN39, a derivative of pCN37 with a temperature-sensitive replicon, gave site-specific disruptants of the hsa and seb genes in 37%-100% of plated colonies without selection. To disrupt hsa, an essential gene, we used a group II intron that integrates in the sense orientation relative to target gene transcription and thus could be removed by RNA splicing, enabling the production of functional HSa protein. We show that because splicing of the Ll.LtrB intron by the intron-encoded protein is temperature-sensitive, this method yields a conditional hsa disruptant that grows at 32 degrees C but not 43 degrees C. The temperature sensitivity of the splicing reaction suggests a general means of obtaining one-step conditional disruptions in any organism. In nature, temperature sensitivity of group II intron splicing could limit the temperature range of an organism containing a group II intron inserted in an essential gene.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus adheres to human intestinal mucus but can be displaced by certain lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - There is increasing evidence that Staphylococcus aureus may colonize the intestinal tract, especially among hospitalized patients. As Staph. aureus has been found to be associated with certain gastrointestinal diseases, it has become important to study whether this bacterium can colonize the intestinal tract and if so, whether it is possible to prevent colonization. Adhesion is the first step in colonization; this study shows that Staph. aureus adheres to mucus from resected human intestinal tissue. Certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB), mainly commercial probiotics, were able to reduce adhesion and viability of adherent Staph. aureus. In displacement assays the amount of adherent Staph. aureus in human intestinal mucus was reduced 39-44% by Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. Moreover, adherent Lactobacillus reuteri, Lc. lactis and P. freudenreichii reduced viability of adherent Staph. aureus by 27-36%, depending on the strain, after 2 h incubation. This was probably due to the production of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide and possibly in the case of L. reuteri to the production of reuterin. This study shows for the first time that Staph. aureus can adhere to human intestinal mucus and adherent bacteria can be displaced and killed by certain LAB strains via in situ production of antimicrobial substances.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in Enterococcus isolates from Batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - This study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of Batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as Enterococcus durans. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Species recognition by means of RAPD-PCR was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. One strain was characterized as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by RAPD-PCR and four strains were grouped with the Enterococcus faecium reference strain. All strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. All strains exhibited antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited Enterococcus faecalis. Isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. However, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
TI  - CopY-like copper inducible repressors are putative 'winged helix' proteins.
AB  - CopY of Enterococcus hirae is a well characterized copper-responsive repressor involved in copper homeostasis. In the absence of copper, it binds to the promoter. In high copper, the CopZ copper chaperone donates copper to CopY, thereby releasing it from the promoter and allowing transcription of the downstream copper homeostatic genes of the cop operon. We here show that the CopY-like repressors from E. hirae, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus mutans have similar affinities not only for their native promoters, but also for heterologous cop promoters. CopZ of L. lactis accelerated the release of CopY from the promoter, suggesting that CopZ of L. lactis acts as copper chaperone, similar to CopZ in E. hirae. The consensus binding motif of the CopY-like repressors was shown to be TACAxxTGTA. The same binding motif is present in promoters controlled by BlaI of Bacillus licheniformis, MecI of Staphylococcus aureus and related repressors. BlaI and MecI have known structures and belong to the family of 'winged helix' proteins. In the N- terminal domain, they share significant sequence similarity with CopY of E. hirae. Moreover, they bind to the same TACAxxTGTA motif. NMR analysis of the N-terminal DNA binding domain of CopY of L. lactis showed that it contained the same alpha-helical content like the same regions of BlaI and MecI. These findings suggest that the DNA binding domains of CopY-like repressors are also of the 'winged helix' type.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysostaphin and a Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage  endolysin produced and secreted by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The expression and secretion signals of the Sep protein from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 were used to direct export of two peptidoglycan hydrolases by Lb. fermentum BR11, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917 and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. The production levels, hydrolytic and bacteriocidal activities of the Listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase endolysin Ply511 and the glycylglycine endopeptidase lysostaphin were examined. Buffering of the growth media to a neutral pH allowed detection of Ply511 and lysostaphin peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity from all lactic acid bacteria. It was found that purified Ply511 has a pH activity range similar to that of lysostaphin with both enzymes functioning optimally under alkaline conditions. Supernatants from lactobacilli expressing lysostaphin reduced viability of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by approximately 8 log(10) CFU/ml compared to controls. However, supernatants containing Ply511 were unable to control L. monocytogenes growth. In coculture experiments, both Lb. plantarum and Lb. fermentum synthesizing lysostaphin were able to effectively reduce MRSA cell numbers by >7.4 and 1.7 log(10)CFU/ml, respectively, while lactic acid bacteria secreting Ply511 were unable to significantly inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes. Our results demonstrate that lysostaphin and Ply511 can be expressed in an active form from different lactic acid bacteria and lysostaphin showed superior killing activity. Lactobacilli producing lysostaphin may have potential for in situ biopreservation in foodstuffs or for prevention of S. aureus infections.
TI  - Fibronectin-binding proteins of Staphylococcus aureus mediate activation of human platelets via fibrinogen and fibronectin bridges to integrin GPIIb/IIIa and IgG binding to the FcgammaRIIa receptor.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of infective endocarditis (IE). Platelet activation promoted by S. aureus resulting in aggregation and thrombus formation is an important step in the pathogenesis of IE. Here, we report that the fibrinogen/fibronectin-binding proteins FnBPA and FnBPB are major platelet-activating factors on the surface of S. aureus from the exponential phase of growth. Truncated derivatives of FnBPA, presenting either the fibrinogen-binding A domain or the fibronectin-binding BCD region, each promoted platelet activation when expressed on the surface of S. aureus or Lactococcus lactis, indicating two distinct mechanisms of activation. FnBPA-promoted platelet activation is mediated by fibrinogen and fibronectin bridges between the A domain and the BCD domains, respectively, to the low affinity form of the integrin GPIIb/IIIa on resting platelets. Antibodies recognizing the FnBPA A domain or the complex between the FnBPA BCD domains and fibronectin were essential for activation promoted by bacteria expressing the A domain or the BCD domain respectively. Activation was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (IV-3) specific for the FcgammaRIIa IgG receptor on platelets. We propose that the activation of quiescent platelets by bacteria expressing FnBPs involves the formation of a bridge between the bacterial cell and the platelet surface by (i) fibronectin and fibrinogen interacting with the low affinity form of GPIIb/IIIa and (ii) by antibodies specific to FnBPs that engage the platelet Fc receptor FcgammaRIIa. Platelet activation by S. aureus clinical IE isolates from both the exponential and stationary phases of growth was completely inhibited by monoclonal antibody IV-3 suggesting that the IgG-FcgammaRIIa interaction is of fundamental importance for platelet activation mediated by this organism. This suggests new avenues for development of therapeutics against vascular infections.
TI  - Balancing the loss and acquisition of pathogenic traits in food-associated bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Purification of a novel arthropod defensin from the American oyster, Crassostrea  virginica.
AB  - An antimicrobial peptide was purified from acidified gill extract of a bivalve mollusk, the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), by preparative acid-urea--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The 4265.0 Da peptide had 38 amino acids, including 6 cysteines. It showed strongest activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Staphylococcus aureus; minimum effective concentrations [MECs] 2.4 and 3.0 microg/ml, respectively) but also had significant activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli D31 and Vibrio parahemolyticus; MECs 7.6 and 15.0 microg/ml, respectively). Comparison of the amino acid sequence with those of other known antimicrobial peptides revealed that the novel peptide had high sequence homology to arthropod defensins, including those from other bivalves, the mussels Mytilus edulis and Mytilus galloprovincialis. This is the first antimicrobial peptide to be isolated from any oyster species and we have named it American oyster defensin (AOD).
TI  - Purification and characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis H-559 isolated from kimchi.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from kimchi and screened for bacteriocin production. Strain H-559, identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity among them and was active against pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus as well as many lactic acid bacteria. The antimicrobial substance produced by L. lactis subsp. lactis H-559 was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin, and protease type IX and XIV and was confirmed to be a bacteriocin. The bacteriocin activity was stable from pH 2.0-11.0 and up to 10 min heating at 100 degrees C. The bacteriocin was sequentially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Its molecular weight was determined to be 3343.7 Da by MALDI-mass spectrometry. Isoleucine was detected as the first N-terminal amino acid residue but the remaining amino acid sequence could not be determined by the Edman degradation method. It was different from other bacteriocins in terms of pH stability, molecular weight, amino acid composition, and the partial amino acid sequences of peptides obtained by acid hydrolysis.
TI  - Dual antibacterial mechanisms of nisin Z against Gram-positive and Gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  - Nisin, an amphipathic antibiotic peptide, is produced by a number of strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. It has been employed as a food preservative as it has a high antibacterial activity with a relatively low toxicity for humans. Nisin is known to exert a high antibacterial activity against Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria. However, purified nisin Z was found to show an antibacterial activity both against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To clarify the mechanisms of activity, nisin Z and purified nisin Z were tested for their antibacterial activities in a high-salt environment. The activity of nisin Z against Staphylococcus aureus was stable even in the presence of NaCl at 100 mM, showing ca. 2log colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction. In contrast, the activity of nisin Z against Escherichia coli was highly sensitive to the same concentration of NaCl, and CFU reduction was not observed. Furthermore, purified nisin Z caused the permeabilisation both of S. aureus and E. coli cytoplasmic membranes. The permeabilisation of E. coli but not S. aureus cytoplasmic membranes was remarkably reduced in a high-salt environment. Moreover, vancomycin inhibited the nisin Z-induced permeabilisation of the S. aureus cytoplasmic membrane. These results suggest that nisin Z utilises two distinct mechanisms of antibacterial activity: a high-salt-sensitive mechanism for E. coli and a high-salt-insensitive mechanism for S. aureus.
TI  - The recombinant phage lysin LysK has a broad spectrum of lytic activity against clinically relevant staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study concerns the cloning, characterization, and expression of the lysin (LysK) from staphylococcal phage K in Lactococcus lactis. Lactococcal lysates containing recombinant LysK were found to inhibit a range of different species of staphylococci isolated from bovine and human infection sources, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. LysK thus has potential as an antimicrobial for applications in the prevention and/or treatment of infections caused by staphylococci.
TI  - Roles for fibrinogen, immunoglobulin and complement in platelet activation promoted by Staphylococcus aureus clumping factor A.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of infective endocarditis (IE) in patients without a history of prior heart valve damage. The ability to stimulate the activation of resting platelets and their subsequent aggregation is regarded as an important virulence factor of bacteria that cause IE. Clumping factor A is the dominant surface protein responsible for platelet activation by S. aureus cells in the stationary phase of growth. This study used Lactococcus lactis as a surrogate host to study the mechanism of ClfA-promoted platelet activation. Expression of ClfA from a nisin-inducible promoter demonstrated that a minimum level of surface-expressed ClfA was required. Using platelets that were purified from plasma, the requirement for both bound fibrinogen and immunoglobulin was demonstrated. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) requirement is consistent with the potent inhibition of platelet activation by a monoclonal antibody specific for the platelet FcgammaRIIa receptor. Furthermore the IgG must contain antibodies specific for the ClfA A domain. A model is proposed whereby bacterial cells armed with a sufficient number of surface-bound fibrinogen molecules can engage resting platelet glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa, aided by bound IgG molecules, which encourages the clustering of FcgammaRIIa receptors. This can trigger activation of signal transduction leading to activation of GPIIb/IIIa and aggregation of platelets. In addition, analysis of a mutant of ClfA totally lacking the ability to bind fibrinogen revealed a second, although less efficient, mechanism of platelet activation. The fibrinogen-independent pathway required IgG and complement deposition to trigger platelet aggregation.
TI  - Optimization of the Lactococcus lactis nisin-controlled gene expression system NICE for industrial applications.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The nisin-controlled gene expression system NICE of Lactococcus lactis is one of the most widely used expression systems in Gram-positive bacteria. Despite its widespread use, no optimization of the culture conditions and nisin induction has been carried out to obtain maximum yields. As a model system induced production of lysostaphin, an antibacterial protein (mainly against Staphylococcus aureus) produced by S. simulans biovar. Staphylolyticus, was used. Three main areas need optimization for maximum yields: cell density, nisin-controlled induction and protein production, and parameters specific for the target-protein. RESULTS: In a series of pH-controlled fermentations the following parameters were optimized: pH of the culture, use of NaOH or NH4OH as neutralizing agent, the addition of zinc and phosphate, the fermentation temperature, the time point of induction (cell density of the culture), the amount of nisin added for induction and the amount of three basic medium components, i.e. yeast extract, peptone and lactose. For each culture growth and lysostaphin production was followed. Lysostaphin production yields depended on all parameters that were varied. In the course of the optimization a three-fold increase in lysostaphin yield was achieved from 100 mg/l to 300 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Protein production with the NICE gene expression system in L. lactis strongly depends on the medium composition, the fermentation parameters and the amount of nisin added for induction. Careful optimization of key parameters lead to a significant increase in the yield of the target protein.
TI  - Industrial-scale production and purification of a heterologous protein in Lactococcus lactis using the nisin-controlled gene expression system NICE: the case of lysostaphin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The NIsin-Controlled gene Expression system NICE of Lactococcus lactis is one of the most widespread used expression systems of Gram-positive bacteria. It is used in more than 100 laboratories for laboratory-scale gene expression experiments. However, L. lactis is also a micro-organism with a large biotechnological potential. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether protein production in L. lactis using the NICE system can also effectively be performed at the industrial-scale of fermentation. RESULTS: Lysostaphin, an antibacterial protein (mainly against Staphylococcus aureus) from S. simulans biovar. Staphylolyticus, was used as a model system. Food-grade lysostaphin expression constructs in L. lactis were grown at 1L-, 300-L and 3000-L scale and induced with nisin for lysostaphin production. The induction process was equally effective at all scales and yields of about 100 mg/L were obtained. Up-scaling was easy and required no specific effort. Furthermore, we describe a simple and effective way of downstream processing to obtain a highly purified lysostaphin, which has been used for clinical phase I trials. CONCLUSION: This is the first example that shows that nisin-regulated gene expression in L. lactis can be used at industrial scale to produce large amounts of a target protein, such as lysostaphin. Downstream processing was simple and in a few steps produced a highly purified and active enzyme.
TI  - pIH01, a small cryptic plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum IH3.
AB  - A small cryptic plasmid pIH01 from Leuconostoc citreum IH3 was characterized. This 1.8-kb sized plasmid contains single open reading frame that encodes a RepC class protein (342 amino acids) and a conserved pT181-type double strand origin, suggesting a rolling circle replication mode. This putative replicase protein shows the highest similarity to a replicase from pFR18 plasmid of Leuconostoc mesenteroides FR52 (64% identity), one of the pT181-type rolling circle plasmid family and contains a strictly conserved RepC-type active site sequence of pT181 family. A shuttle vector that was developed on the basis of this cryptic plasmid by insertion of both erythromycin resistance gene (ermC) from pE194 and Escherichia coli ColE1 origin was able to transform Leuconostoc strains, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactococcus lactis. Therefore, pIH01 derivative plasmids might be useful for the manipulation of Leuconostoc strains.
TI  - Fibrinogen and fibronectin binding cooperate for valve infection and invasion in  Staphylococcus aureus experimental endocarditis.
AB  - The expression of Staphylococcus aureus adhesins in Lactococcus lactis identified clumping factor A (ClfA) and fibronectin-binding protein A (FnBPA) as critical for valve colonization in rats with experimental endocarditis. This study further analyzed their role in disease evolution. Infected animals were followed for 3 d. ClfA-positive lactococci successfully colonized damaged valves, but were spontaneously eradicated over 48 h. In contrast, FnBPA-positive lactococci progressively increased bacterial titers in vegetations and spleens. At imaging, ClfA-positive lactococci were restricted to the vegetations, whereas FnBPA-positive lactococci also invaded the adjacent endothelium. This reflected the capacity of FnBPA to trigger cell internalization in vitro. Because FnBPA carries both fibrinogen- and fibronectin-binding domains, we tested the role of these functionalities by deleting the fibrinogen-binding domain of FnBPA and supplementing it with the fibrinogen-binding domain of ClfA in cis or in trans. Deletion of the fibrinogen-binding domain of FnBPA did not alter fibronectin binding and cell internalization in vitro. However, it totally abrogated valve infectivity in vivo. This ability was restored in cis by inserting the fibrinogen-binding domain of ClfA into truncated FnBPA, and in trans by coexpressing full-length ClfA and truncated FnBPA on two separate plasmids. Thus, fibrinogen and fibronectin binding could cooperate for S. aureus valve colonization and endothelial invasion in vivo.
TI  - The putative autolysin regulator LytR in Streptococcus mutans plays a role in cell division and is growth-phase regulated.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is the primary odontopathogen present in supragingival plaque and causes the oral disease known as dental caries. Colonization of the oral cavity by S. mutans requires the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and occurs by both sucrose-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Sucrose-independent adhesion of S. mutans in vitro has been shown to involve an ORF (ORF0317) encoding a homologue (39 %) to LytR, a regulator of autolysin activity in Bacillus subtilis. The protein encoded by ORF0317, LytR, belongs to the LytR/CpsA/Psr protein family. This family has a putative role in cell-wall structural maintenance, possibly through autolysin regulation. Autolysins have also been shown to be important in surface adhesion in Lactococcus lactis and in the pathogenic properties of Streptococcus pneumoniae. To investigate the role of autolysins in the adhesion and pathogenesis of S. mutans, a LytR mutant was constructed. The mutant grows in long chains, which may indicate a defect in cell division. Further experiments with the mutant strain show increased autolytic activity, indicating that LytR attenuates S. mutans autolytic activity, possibly through regulation of the expression of autolytic enzymes. No defect in cell-to-surface adherence or biofilm growth was seen in the LytR mutant. However, a connection between cell growth phase and transcription of lytR was found.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Characterization of the fibrinogen-binding surface protein Fbl of Staphylococcus  lugdunensis.
AB  - The fbl gene of Staphylococcus lugdunensis encodes a protein Fbl that is 58 % identical to the clumping factor A (ClfA) of Staphylococcus aureus. The fbl gene was present in eight clinical isolates of S. lugdunensis. When Fbl was expressed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis it promoted adherence to immobilized fibrinogen and cell clumping in a fibrinogen solution. Purified recombinant Fbl region A bound to immobilized fibrinogen in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the adherence of both Fbl-expressing and ClfA-expressing strains of L. lactis to fibrinogen. Adherence of S. lugdunensis and L. lactis Fbl(+) to immobilized fibrinogen was also inhibited by rabbit anti-Fbl region A antibodies and rabbit anti-ClfA region A antibodies, as well as by human immunoglobulin with a high level of anti-ClfA antibodies. Alignment of the A domains of CflA and Fbl revealed that all of the ClfA residues implicated in binding to the gamma-chain of fibrinogen are conserved in Fbl. Nevertheless Fbl had a tenfold lower affinity for fibrinogen, suggesting that sequence differences that occur elsewhere in the protein, possibly in beta-strand E of domain N2, affect ligand binding.
TI  - A xylose-inducible expression system for Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A new controlled production system to target heterologous proteins to cytoplasm or extracellular medium is described for Lactococcus lactis NCDO2118. It is based on the use of a xylose-inducible lactococcal promoter, P(xylT). The capacities of this system to produce cytoplasmic and secreted proteins were tested using the Staphylococcus aureus nuclease gene (nuc) fused or not to the lactococcal Usp45 signal peptide. Xylose-inducible nuc expression is tightly controlled and resulted in high-level and long-term protein production, and correct targeting either to the cytoplasm or to the extracellular medium. Furthermore, this expression system is versatile and can be switched on or off easily by adding either xylose or glucose, respectively. These results confirm the potential of this expression system as an alternative and useful tool for the production of proteins of interest in L. lactis.
TI  - New expression system tightly controlled by zinc availability in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Here we developed the new expression system P(Zn) zitR, based on the regulatory signals (P(Zn) promoter and zitR repressor) of the Lactococcus lactis zit operon, involved in Zn(2+) high-affinity uptake and regulation. A P(Zn) zitR-controlled expression vector was constructed, and expression regulation was studied with two reporter genes, uspnuc and lacLM; these genes encode, respectively, a protein derived from Staphylococcus aureus secreted nuclease and Leuconostoc mesenteroides cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase. Nuclease and beta-galactosidase activities of L. lactis MG1363 cells expressing either uspnuc or lacLM under the control of P(Zn) zitR were evaluated on plates and quantified from liquid cultures as a function of divalent metal ion, particularly Zn(2+), availability in the environment. Our results demonstrate that P(Zn) zitR is highly inducible upon divalent cation starvation, obtained either through EDTA addition or during growth in chemically defined medium, and is strongly repressed in the presence of excess Zn(2+). The efficiency of the P(Zn) zitR expression system was compared to that of the well-known nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system with the same reporter genes cloned under either P(Zn) zitR or P(nisA) nisRK control. lacLM induction levels reached with both systems were on the same order of magnitude, even though the NICE system is fivefold more efficient than the P(Zn) zitR system. An even smaller difference or no difference was observed after 3 h of induction when nuclease was used as a reporter for Western blotting detection. P(Zn) zitR proved to be a powerful expression system for L. lactis, as it is tightly controlled by the zinc concentration in the medium.
TI  - Identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - Screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kDa protein. Analysis of the 3010-bp DNA insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encodes LysA, a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages Lj928 and Lj965 from Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lp1 and Lp2 from Lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage Phiadh. The immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated ORF downstream of lysA which has similarity to glutamyl-tRNA synthetases. The N-terminus of LysA has sequence similarity with N-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the C-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial SH3b domains. C-terminal bacterial SH3b domains were identified in the majority of Lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. LysA was expressed in Escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different Lactobacillus species and against Lactococcus lactis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that LysA is 2 and 8000 times more active against L. fermentum than L. lactis and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.
TI  - Expression of the Staphylococcus aureus surface proteins HtrA1 and HtrA2 in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus encodes two HtrA-like serine surface proteases, called HtrA1 and HtrA2. The roles of these HtrA homologs were distinguished by expression studies in a heterologous host, Lactococcus lactis, whose single extracellular protease, HtrA(Ll), was absent. HtrA(Ll) is involved in stress resistance, and processing and/or degradation of extracellular proteins. Controlled expression of staphylococcal htrA1 and htrA2 was achieved in L. lactis strain NZ9000 DeltahtrA, as confirmed with anti-HtrA1 and anti-HtrA2 specific antibodies. HtrA1 fully restored thermo-resistance to the htrA-defective L. lactis strain, despite a poor capacity to degrade abnormal or truncated proteins. We therefore propose that activities of HtrA1 other than proteolysis may be sufficient for high-temperature growth complementation. HtrA2 is 36% identical to HtrA(Ll), and was highly expressed in L. lactis; nevertheless, it displayed nearly no detectable activities. The poor proteolytic activities of staphylococcal HtrA proteins in L. lactis may reflect a requirement for S. aureus-specific co-factors.
TI  - Biosurfactant from Lactococcus lactis 53 inhibits microbial adhesion on silicone  rubber.
AB  - The ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium Lactococcus lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. Water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). The results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6 from 2,100 to 220 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), and Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. The deposition rates of Rothia dentocariosa GBJ 52/2B, Candida albicans GBJ 13/4A, and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant as compared with the other strains. This study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone-rubber voice prostheses.
TI  - Influence of growth conditions on the production of a bacteriocin by Lactococcus  lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  - Bacteriocin ST34BR, a small polypeptide of 2.9 kDa produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ST34BR, inhibits the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. MRS broth, adjusted to pH 6.0 yielded 6,400 AU/ml, compared to 400 AU/ml recorded in BHI broth, M17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 8% and 10% (w/v) molasses. At pH of 4.5 only 800 AU/ml was produced. Based on comparative studies in MRS broth, without organic nitrogen, supplemented with different combinations of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract, tryptone was identified as the stimulating nitrogen compound. Growth in the presence of 20 g/l glucose, maltose, mannose or sucrose yielded bacteriocin levels of 6,400 AU/ml, whereas the same concentration of lactose and fructose yielded 3,200 AU/ml and 1,600 AU/ml, respectively. No difference in bacteriocin ST34BR activity was recorded in MRS broth supplemented with 2 g/l K2HPO4 and 2 g/l, 5 g/l, 10 g/l or 50 g/l KH2PO4. However, 20 g/l KH2PO4 increased bacteriocin ST34BR production to 12,800 AU/ml. Glycerol at 1g/l to 10 g/l in MRS broth reduced bacteriocin activity to 3,200 AU/ml, whilst 20 g/l and 50 g/l yielded only 1,600 AU/ml. The presence of cyanocobalamin, L-ascorbic acid, thiamine and DL-6,8-thioctic acid in MRS broth at 1.0 ppm, respectively, did not result in increased activity levels.
TI  - Characterization of mesentericin ST99, a bacteriocin produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99 isolated from boza.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria isolated from Boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from Belogratchik, Bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. With the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of Listeria innocua and Lactobacillus plantarum. The cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum ST99, inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, several Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Clostridium spp., Carnobacterium spp., L. mesenteroides and Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. Maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (AU)/ml, was recorded in MRS broth after 24 h at 30 degrees C. Incubation in the presence of protease IV and pronase E resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin ST99. No loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, Triton X-100, N-laurylsarcosin, EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Mesentericin ST99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees C and after 2 h of incubation at pH 2 to 12. Metabolically active cells of L. innocua treated with mesentericin ST99 did not undergo lysis. Mesentericin ST99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain ST99. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by Sep-Pack C18 chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 Nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  - Immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. This study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. L. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. The antimicrobial potential of immobilized L. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus) or Pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. Results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized L. lactis inhibited the growth of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, Kocuria varians, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. With the addition of 10 mM of a chelating agent (EDTA) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of E. coli; however, P. putida and Salmonella Typhi were unaffected by this treatment. These results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
TI  - Inhibition of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain in Afuega'l Pitu cheese by the nisin Z-producing strain Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IPLA 729.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains are a potential threat for food safety because foodborne illness caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has been reported even though these strains were only associated with nosocomial infections until recently. This article focuses on the inhibitory effect of the nisin Z-producing strain Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IPLA 729 on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus CECT 4013, a methicillin-resistant strain. S. aureus was inhibited by the presence of the nisin producer IPLA 729 in buffered Trypticase soy broth, milk, and Afuega'l Pitu cheese, an acid-coagulated cheese manufactured in Asturias, Northern Spain. A reduction of 3.66 log units was observed in Trypticase soy broth at the end of the incubation period. In milk, viable counts of S. aureus were undetectable or were reduced by 2.16 log units in 24 h depending on the initial inoculum (1.8 x 10(4) and 7.2 x 10(6) CFU/ml). The staphylococcal strain was also undetected in test cheeses in which the nisin Z producer was present whereas 2 log units were detected in control cheeses at the end of ripening.
TI  - Analysis of orthologous hrcA genes in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The hrcA gene codes for a transcriptional repressor protein interacting with the  CIRCE operator thereby reducing expression of the groE operon of more than 120 bacterial species. At least in Bacillus subtilis, the activity of the HrcA protein is modulated by the GroE chaperonin system. We amplified the hrcA gene from five different bacterial species and analyzed its activity in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. While those from Clostridium acetobutylicum and Staphylococcus aureus turned out to be active, those of Helicobacter pylori, Lactococcus lactis and Thermotoga maritima were inactive in E. coli, but that of T. maritima turned out to repress expression of the reporter gene in B. subtilis. All these results strongly suggest to us a specific recognition of HrcA by the GroE chaperonin system.
TI  - Comparative analysis of gene expression among low G+C gram-positive genomes.
AB  - We present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes in the low G+C Gram-positive genomes of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus halodurans, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Clostridium perfringens. Most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are PHX in these genomes, but not those involved in the TCA cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. Only B. subtilis and B. halodurans have several TCA cycle PHX genes, whereas the TCA pathway is entirely missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two Streptococcus species and is incomplete in Listeria, Lactococcus, and Clostridium. Pyruvate-formate lyase, an enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest PHX genes in all these genomes except for C. acetobutylicum (not PHX), and B. subtilis, and B. halodurans (missing). Pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently PHX in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. Phosphotransferase system genes are generally PHX with selection of different substrates in different genomes. The various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.
TI  - The prophages of Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533: comparative genomics and transcription analysis.
AB  - Two non-inducible, but apparently complete prophages were identified in the genome of the sequenced Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC 533. The 38- and 40-kb-long prophages Lj928 and Lj965 represent distinct lineages of Sfi11-like pac-site Siphoviridae unrelated at the DNA sequence level. The deduced structural proteins from Lj928 demonstrated aa sequence identity with Lactococcus lactis phage TP901-1, while Lj965 shared sequence links with Streptococcus thermophilus phage O1205. With the exception of tRNA genes, inserted between DNA replication and DNA packaging genes, the transcription of the prophage was restricted to the genome segments near both attachment sites. Transcribed genes unrelated to phage functions were inserted between the phage repressor and integrase genes; one group of genes shared sequence relatedness with a mobile DNA element in Staphylococcus aureus. A short, but highly transcribed region was located between the phage lysin and right attachment site; it lacked a protein-encoding function in one prophage.
TI  - A food-grade delivery system for Lactococcus lactis and evaluation of inducible gene expression.
AB  - The genetic improvement of Lactococcus lactis is a matter of biotechnological interest in the food industry and in the pharmaceutical and medical fields. However, to construct a food-grade delivery system, both the presence of antibiotic markers or plasmid sequences should be avoided and the maintenance and expression of the cloned gene should be guaranteed. The objective of this work was to produce crossover mutants of L. lactis with a reporter gene under the control of an inducible promoter in order to evaluate the level of gene expression. We utilized a nuclease gene of Staphylococcus aureus as a reporter gene, P(nisA) as the nisin-inducible promoter, a non-essential gene involved in histidine biosynthesis of L. lactis as the site for homologous recombination, and pRV300 as a suicide vector for the genomic integration in L. lactis NZ9000. Single- and double-crossover mutants were identified by genotype and phenotype. Relative to episomal transformants of L. lactis, the level of expression of the heterologous protein after nisin induction was similar in the crossover mutants, suggesting that a single copy of the heterologous gene can be used to produce the protein of interest.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - The screening of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria and their application to inactivating psychrotrophic food-borne pathogens.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various food samples and evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Cells suspended in 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose plus 0.5% (wt/vol) lactate (pH 7.0) were incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees C under aeration. Among 193 strains, 27 strains accumulated 201-300 ppm H2O2, and 4 strains accumulated more than 301 ppm H2O2 in the cell suspensions. Among the 9 high-level H2O2-producing strains, 8 strains were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. The cell-free filtrate from Lc. lactis subsp. lactis AI 62, which contained approximately 350 ppm H2O2, was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria ivanovii, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Aeromonas hydrophila. After 1 h incubation at 30 degrees C in the cell-free filtrate, the initial viable cell counts of the target bacteria (5.53-6.00 log cfu/mL) were reduced by 0.12-5.00 log units, except in the case of enterococci. The sensitivity varied with the bacterial species and pH. The enterococci were resistant to the treatment. Our results show that H2O2 accumulated by lactic acid bacteria in a cell suspension is very effective in reducing the viable cell count of food-borne pathogens.
TI  - The Staphylococcus aureus surface protein SasG and its homologues promote bacterial adherence to human desquamated nasal epithelial cells.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus binds to human desquamated nasal epithelial cells, a phenomenon likely to be important in nasal colonization. ClfB was identified previously as one staphylococcal adhesin that promoted binding to nasal epithelia. In this study, it is shown that the S. aureus surface protein SasG, identified previously by in silico analysis of genome sequences, and two homologous proteins, Pls of S. aureus and AAP of Staphylococcus epidermidis, also promote bacterial adherence to nasal epithelial cells. Conditions for in vitro expression of SasG by S. aureus were not found. Adherence assays were therefore performed with S. aureus and Lactococcus lactis expressing SasG from an expression plasmid. These studies showed that SasG did not bind several ligands typically bound by S. aureus. Significantly, SasG and Pls did promote bacterial adherence to nasal epithelial cells. Furthermore, pre-incubation of epithelial cells with purified recombinant proteins revealed that the N-terminal A regions of SasG, Pls and AAP, but not the B repeats of SasG, inhibited adherence of L. lactis expressing SasG in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that SasG, Pls and AAP bind to the same as-yet-unidentified receptor on the surface of nasal epithelial cells. In addition, expression of SasG, like Pls, reduced adherence of S. aureus to fibronectin and fibrinogen.
TI  - Inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus by the commensal bacteria of human milk.
AB  - AIMS: To study the bacterial diversity in expressed human milk with a focus on detecting bacteria with an antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, known as a causative agent of maternal breast infections and neonatal infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: Random isolates (n = 509) were collected from breast milk samples (n = 40) of healthy lactating women, genotypically identified, and tested for antimicrobial activity against Staph. aureus. Commensal staphylococci (64%) and oral streptococci (30%), with Staph. epidermidis, Strep. salivarius, and Strep. mitis as the most frequent isolates, were the predominant bacterial species in breast milk. One-fifth of Staph. epidermidis and half of Strep. salivarius isolates suppressed growth of Staph. aureus. Enterococci (Ent. faecalis), isolated from 7.5% of samples, and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lact. crispatus, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconoctoc mesenteroides), isolated from 12.5% of samples, were also effective against Staph. aureus. One L. lactis isolate was shown to produce nisin, a bacteriocin used in food industry to prevent bacterial pathogens and spoilage. CONCLUSIONS: Expressed breast milk contains commensal bacteria, which inhibit Staph. aureus. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The strains inhibitory against the pathogen Staph. aureus have potential use as bacteriotherapeutic agents in preventing neonatal and maternal breast infections caused by this bacterium.
TI  - Optimization of signal peptide SP310 for heterologous protein production in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The authors have previously reported the identification of novel signal peptides  (SPs) from Lactococcus lactis using transposon insertion. Of these, SP310 caused the highest level of secretion. However, the levels were lower than those obtained using the signal peptide from Usp45 (SPUSP), the major secreted lactococcal protein. In this study, site-directed mutagenesis of signal peptide SP310 was used to investigate the effect of amino acid alterations on lactococcal secretion and to improve secretion efficiency. Several mutated SPs caused higher secretion. This increase in secretion was due to modifications in the cleavage region. In fermenter experiments, the signal peptide SP310mut2 resulted in an extracellular Staphylococcus aureus nuclease (Nuc) yield which was 45 % higher than that with the natural SP310. Surprisingly, increasing the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic core or increasing the number of positively charged amino acids in the N-terminal region of SP310 decreased secretion. High extracellular yields of Nuc resulted from more efficient secretion, as strains with less efficient SPs accumulated more intracellular SP-Nuc precursor.
TI  - In vitro conjugal transfer of tetracycline resistance from Lactobacillus isolates to other Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The ability of 14 Lactobacillus strains, isolated from fermented dry sausages, to transfer tetracycline resistance encoded by tet(M) through conjugation was examined using filter mating experiments. Seven out of 14 tetracycline-resistant Lactobacillus isolates were able to transfer in vitro this resistance to Enterococcus faecalis at frequencies ranging from 10(-4) to 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. Two of these strains could also transfer their resistance to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, whereas no conjugal transfer to a Staphylococcus aureus recipient was found. These data suggest that meat lactobacilli might be reservoir organisms for acquired resistance genes that can be spread to other lactic acid bacteria. In order to assess the risk of this potential hazard, the magnitude of transfer along the food chain merits further research.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Identification and characteristics of nisin Z-producing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from Kimchi.
AB  - We isolated bacteriocin-producing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis from Kimchi. The bacteriocin inhibited strains of Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Listeria monocytogenes, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and one out of four methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as some closely related lactic acid bacteria. In tricine-SDS-PAGE, the bacteriocin migrated with an apparent molecular weight of about 4 kDa to the same location as nisin A and crude nisin Z. The gene encoding this bacteriocin was found to be identical to that of nisin Z with direct PCR sequence methods. The inhibitory activity was stable against heat and pH, but it was lost at 100 degrees C for 1 h and at 121 degrees C for 15 min. The bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but was not affected by lysozyme, lipase, catalase, or beta-glucosidase. There were some differences in characteristics from those of nisins described previously.
TI  - The genes coding for enterocin EJ97 production by Enterococcus faecalis EJ97 are  located on a conjugative plasmid.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis EJ97 produces a cationic bacteriocin (enterocin EJ97) of low molecular mass (5,327.7 Da). The complete amino acid sequence of enterocin EJ97 was elucidated after automated microsequencing of oligopeptides generated by endoproteinase GluC digestion and cyanogen bromide treatment. Transfer of the 60-kb conjugative plasmid pEJ97 from the bacteriocinogenic strain E. faecalis EJ97 to E. faecalis OG1X conferred bacteriocin production and resistance on the recipient. The genetic determinants of enterocin EJ97 were located in an 11.3-kb EcoRI-BglII DNA fragment of pEJ97. This region was cloned and sequenced. It contains the ej97A structural gene plus three open reading frames (ORFs) (ej97B, ej97C, and ej97D) and three putative ORFs transcribed in the opposite direction (orfA, orfB, and orfC). The gene ej97A translated as a 44-amino-acid residue mature protein lacking a leader peptide with no homology to other bacteriocins described so far. The product of ej97B (Ej97B) shows strong homology in its C-terminal domain to the superfamily of bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporters. The products of ej97C (Ej97C) and ej97D (Ej97D) could be proteins with 71 and 64 residues, respectively, of unknown functions and with no significant similarity to known proteins. There are two additional ORFs (ORF1 and ORF6) flanking the ej97 module, which have been identified as a transposon-like structure (tnp). ORF1 shows similarities to transposase of the Lactococcus lactis element ISS1 and is up to 50% identical to IS1216. This is flanked by two 18-bp inverted repeats (IRs) that are almost identical to those of ISS1 and IS1216. ORF6 (resEJ97) shows strong homology to the resolvase of plasmid pAM373 and up to 40 to 50% homology with the recombinase of several multiresistant plasmids and transposons from Staphylococcus aureus and E. faecalis. These data suggest that EJ97 could represent a new class of bacteriocins with a novel secretion mechanism and that the whole structure could be a composite transposon. Furthermore, two additional gene clusters were found: one cluster is probably related to the region responsible for the replication of plasmid pEJ97, and the second cluster is related to the sex pheromone response. These regions showed a high homology to the corresponding regions of the conjugative plasmids pAM373, pPD1, and pAD1 of E. faecalis, suggesting that they have a common origin.
TI  - Isolation of nisin-producing Lactococcus lactis WNC 20 strain from nham, a traditional Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - A total of 14,020 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from nham and screened for bacteriocin production. One Lactococcus lactis strain WNC 20 produced a bacteriocin that not only inhibited closely related LAB, but also some food-borne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Biochemical studies revealed that the bacteriocin was heat-stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees C for 15 min) and was active over a wide pH range (2-10). The bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase K but not other proteases. The antimicrobial spectrum and some characteristics of this bacteriocin were nearly identical to that of nisin. The gene encoding this bacteriocin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with nisin gene-specific primer. Sequencing of this gene showed identical sequences to nisin Z as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. The ability of the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis WNC 20 may be useful in improving the food safety of the fermented product.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus clumping factor B (ClfB) promotes adherence to human type I cytokeratin 10: implications for nasal colonization.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of sepsis in both community and hospital settings, a major risk factor for which is nasal carriage of the bacterium. Eradication of carriage by topical antibiotics reduces sepsis rates in high-risk individuals, an important strategy for the reduction of nosocomial infection in targeted patient populations. Understanding the mechanisms by which S. aureus adheres to nasal epithelial cells in vivo may lead to alternative methods of decolonization that do not rely on sustained antimicrobial susceptibility. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the S. aureus surface-expressed protein, clumping factor B (ClfB), promotes adherence to immobilized epidermal cytokeratins in vitro. By expressing a range of S. aureus adhesins on the surface of the heterologous host Lactococcus lactis, we demonstrated that adherence to epidermal cytokeratins was conferred by ClfB. Adherence of wild-type S. aureus was inhibited by recombinant ClfB protein or anti-ClfB antibodies, and S. aureus mutants defective in ClfB adhered poorly to epidermal cytokeratins. Expression of ClfB promoted adherence of L. lactis to human desquamated nasal epithelial cells, and a mutant of S. aureus defective in ClfB had reduced adherence compared with wild type. ClfB also promoted adherence of L. lactis cells to a human keratinocyte cell line. Cytokeratin 10 molecules were shown by flow cytometry to be exposed on the surface of both desquamated nasal epithelial cells and keratinocytes. Cytokeratin 10 was also detected on the surface of desquamated human nasal cells using immunofluorescence, and recombinant ClfB protein was shown to bind to cytokeratin K10 extracted from these cells. We also showed that ClfB is transcribed by S. aureus in the human nares. We propose that ClfB is a major determinant in S. aureus nasal colonization.
TI  - A PCR-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  - We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. One specific primer, LbLMA1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes in a number of Lactobacillus strains. Amplification with LbLMA1-rev and R16-1, a universal primer, generated a PCR product for 23 Lactobacillus species. Electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Carnobacterium pissicola, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Weissella confusa, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes DNA were used as template.
TI  - An Enterococcus faecalis ABC homologue (Lsa) is required for the resistance of this species to clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis isolates are resistant to clindamycin (CLI) and quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), and this is thought to be a species characteristic. Disruption of a gene (abc-23, now designated lsa, for "lincosamide and streptogramin A resistance") of E. faecalis was associated with a > or =40-fold decrease in MICs of Q-D (to 0.75 microg/ml), CLI (to 0.12 to 0.5 microg/ml), and dalfopristin (DAL) (to 4 to 8 microg/ml) for the wild-type E. faecalis parental strain (Q-D MIC, 32 microg/ml; CLI MIC, 32 to 48 microg/ml; DAL MIC, 512 microg/ml). Complementation of the disruption mutant with lsa on a shuttle plasmid resulted in restoration of the MICs of CLI, Q-D, and DAL to wild-type levels. Under high-stringency conditions, lsa was found in 180 of 180 isolates of E. faecalis but in none of 189 other enterococci. Among 19 erm(B)-lacking Enterococcus faecium strains, 9 (47%) were highly susceptible to CLI (MIC, 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml) and had DAL MICs of 4 to 16 microg/ml; for the remaining erm(B)-lacking E. faecium strains, the CLI and DAL MICs were 4 to > 256 and 2 to > 128 microg/ml, respectively. In contrast, none of 32 erm(B)-lacking E. faecalis strains were susceptible (CLI MIC range, 16 to 32 microg/ml; DAL MIC range, > or =32 microg/ml). When lsa was introduced into an E. faecium strain initially susceptible to CLI, the MICs of CLI and DAL increased > or =60-fold and that of Q-D increased 6-fold (to 3 to 6 microg/ml). Introduction of lsa into two DAL-resistant (MICs, > 128 microg/ml), Q-D-susceptible (MICs, 0.5 and 1.5 microg/ml) E. faecium strains (CLI MICs, 12 and >256 microg/ml) resulted in an increase in the Q-D MICs from 3- to 10-fold (to 8 and >32 microg/ml), respectively. Although efflux was not studied, the similarity (41 to 64%) of the predicted Lsa protein to ABC proteins such as Vga(A), Vga(B), and Msr(A) of Staphylococcus aureus and YjcA of Lactococcus lactis and the presence of Walker A and B ATP-binding motifs suggest that this resistance may be related to efflux of these antibiotics. In conclusion, lsa appears to be an intrinsic gene of E. faecalis that explains the characteristic resistance of this species to CLI and Q-D.
TI  - Multiple mechanisms for the activation of human platelet aggregation by Staphylococcus aureus: roles for the clumping factors ClfA and ClfB, the serine-aspartate repeat protein SdrE and protein A.
AB  - The ability of Staphylococcus aureus cells to induce platelet aggregation has long been recognized. However, despite several attempts to identify the mechanisms involved in this interaction, the nature of the bacterial receptors required remains poorly understood. Using genetic manipulation, this study for the first time provides clear evidence that several S. aureus surface proteins participate in the inter-action with platelets. Mutants of S. aureus strain Newman lacking one or more surface proteins were tested for their ability to stimulate platelet aggregation. This approach was complemented by the expression of a number of candidate proteins in the non-aggregating Gram-positive bacterium Lacto-coccus lactis. S. aureus-induced aggregation was monophasic and was dependent on the platelet receptor GPIIb/IIIa. The fibrinogen-binding proteins, clumping factors A and B and the serine-aspartate repeat protein SdrE could each induce aggregation when expressed in L. lactis. Although protein A expressed in L. lactis was not capable of inducing aggregation independently, it enhanced the aggregation response when expressed on the surface of S. aureus. Thus, S. aureus has multiple mechanisms for stimulating platelet aggregation. Such functional redundancy suggests that this phenomenon may be important in the pathogenesis of invasive diseases such as infective endocarditis.
TI  - Evaluation of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - N-Acetylchitooligosaccharides ((GlcNAc)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. A chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using HCl. After purification, the purity of each (GlcNAc)(1-6) was >86%. The growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (BM) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Eubacterium limosum could use (GlcNAc)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (GlcNac)(1-6). GlcNAc was used more readily than (GlcNAc)(2-6) by Staphylococcus aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. In BM, Streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.
TI  - Signal-sequence-independent secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease in Mycobacterium smegmatis.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus nuclease is a small, secreted protein which has been successfully used as a reporter system to identify exported products in Lactococcus lactis. Here, biochemical evidence is provided that the nuclease is exported by Mycobacterium smegmatis in the presence, but also in the absence of a signal sequence, and thus probably independently of the Sec translocation pathway. This implies that the nuclease should not be used as a reporter system in mycobacteria for the identification of exported products, despite what has been reported previously in the literature. The nuclease can be extended to create hybrid proteins that remain compatible with its secretion, whereas some other shorter fusions are not tolerated. This suggests that correct folding is required for efficient export. Extensive mutational analysis did not identify a specific secretion pathway. This suggests that the nuclease may be exported by different redundant systems or that components of this alternative Sec pathway are essential for bacterial survival.
TI  - Fibronectin-binding protein A of Staphylococcus aureus has multiple, substituting, binding regions that mediate adherence to fibronectin and invasion of endothelial cells.
AB  - Invasive Staphylococcus aureus infection frequently involves bacterial seeding from the bloodstream to other body tissues, a process necessarily involving interactions between circulating bacteria and vascular endothelial cells. Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin-binding protein is central to the invasion of endothelium, fibronectin forming a bridge between bacterial fibronectin-binding proteins and host cell receptors. To dissect further the mechanisms of invasion of endothelial cells by S. aureus, a series of truncated FnBPA proteins that lacked one or more of the A, B, C or D regions were expressed on the surface of S. aureus and tested in fibronectin adhesion, endothelial cell adhesion and invasion assays. We found that this protein has multiple, substituting, fibronectin-binding regions, each capable of conferring both adherence to fibronectin and endothelial cells, and endothelial cell invasion. By expressing S. aureus FnBPA on the surface of the non-invasive Gram-positive organism Lactococcus lactis, we have found that no other bacterial factor is required for invasion. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that, as with other cell types, invasion of endothelial cells is mediated by integrin alpha5beta1. These findings may be of relevance to the development of preventive measures against systemic infection, and bacterial spread in the bacteraemic patient.
TI  - Sequence of the 50-kb conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25.
AB  - The complete 50,237-bp DNA sequence of the conjugative and mobilizing multiresistance plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis RE25 was determined. The plasmid had 58 putative open reading frames, 5 of which encode resistance to 12 antimicrobials. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the 23S RNA methylase are identical to gene products of the broad-host-range plasmid pIP501 from Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, a 30.5-kb segment is almost identical to pIP501. Genes encoding an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyltransferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase are arranged in tandem on a 7.4-kb fragment as previously reported in Tn5405 from Staphylococcus aureus and in pJH1 from E. faecalis. One interrupted and five complete IS elements as well as three replication genes were also identified. pRE25 was transferred by conjugation to E. faecalis, Listeria innocua, and Lactococcus lactis by means of a transfer region that appears similar to that of pIP501. It is concluded that pRE25 may contribute to the further spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via food into the human community.
TI  - Reassessing the role of Staphylococcus aureus clumping factor and fibronectin-binding protein by expression in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Since Staphylococcus aureus expresses multiple pathogenic factors, studying their individual roles in single-gene-knockout mutants is difficult. To circumvent this problem, S. aureus clumping factor A (clfA) and fibronectin-binding protein A (fnbA) genes were constitutively expressed in poorly pathogenic Lactococcus lactis using the recently described pOri23 vector. The recombinant organisms were tested in vitro for their adherence to immobilized fibrinogen and fibronectin and in vivo for their ability to infect rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations. In vitro, both clfA and fnbA increased the adherence of lactococci to their specific ligands to a similar extent as the S. aureus gene donor. In vivo, the minimum inoculum size producing endocarditis in > or =80% of the rats (80% infective dose [ID80]) with the parent lactococcus was > or =10(7) CFU. In contrast, clfA-expressing and fnbA-expressing lactococci required only 10(5) CFU to infect the majority of the animals (P < 0.00005). This was comparable to the infectivities of classical endocarditis pathogens such as S. aureus and streptococci (ID80 = 10(4) to 10(5) CFU) in this model. The results confirmed the role of clfA in endovascular infection, but with a much higher degree of confidence than with single-gene-inactivated staphylococci. Moreover, they identified fnbA as a critical virulence factor of equivalent importance. This was in contrast to previous studies that produced controversial results regarding this very determinant. Taken together, the present observations suggest that if antiadhesin therapy were to be developed, at least both of the clfA and fnbA products should be blocked for the therapy to be effective.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei acquires the binding activity to fibronectin by the expression of the fibronectin binding domain of Streptococcus pyogenes on the cell surface.
AB  - Fibronectin binding domain was expressed on the cell surface of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota which hardly adheres to fibronectin. DNA for the fibronectin binding domain of the sfbl gene, which encodes a fibronectin binding protein of Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, was amplified with polymerase chain reaction, cloned into a surface display vector pSAK332, and introduced into L. casei. The fibronectin binding domain was expressed as a fusion protein consisting of staphylokinase of Staphylococcus aureus and the anchor sequence of cell wall-associated 763 proteinase of Lactococcus lactis NCDO 763. The fibronectin binding ability of the resulting L. casei was confirmed with Western blot analysis, immunoelectron microscopic analysis, and adherence to fibroblast cells. These results indicate that L. casei has acquired a new phenotype to bind fibronectin upon the expression of the fibronectin binding domain on the cell surface. This L. casei also shows binding affinity to fibrinogen, indicating that fibronectin binding domain is involved in the binding to fibrinogen as well.
TI  - The Fbe (SdrG) protein of Staphylococcus epidermidis HB promotes bacterial adherence to fibrinogen.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis strains HB and K28 express surface proteins called Fbe or SdrG, respectively, that have sequence similarity to the clumping factors ClfA and ClfB of Staphylococcus aureus. A mutation in the fbe gene of strain HB was isolated by directed plasmid integration using the broad-host-range temperature-sensitive plasmid pG(+)Host9 (pVE6155). An internal fragment of fbe was cloned into pG(+)Host9 and the chimaeric plasmid was mobilized from S. aureus RN4220 to S. epidermidis 9142 by conjugation promoted by plasmid pGO1. The plasmid was then transferred to S. epidermidis strain HB by phage-48-mediated transduction. The plasmid integrated into the chromosomal fbe gene at a frequency of 2.8 x 10(-4). All the survivors tested had a copy of pG(+)Host9'fbe' integrated into the chromosomal fbe gene either as a single copy or as a tandem array. Western immunoblotting showed that the wall-associated Fbe protein was absent in the mutant. Wild-type S. epidermidis HB adhered to immobilized fibrinogen in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion whereas the mutant did not bind. The Fbe proteins of HB and K28 were expressed at a high level in Lactococcus lactis MG1363 using the expression vector pKS80. These strains adhered strongly to immobilized fibrinogen. These results confirm that Fbe is a fibrinogen-binding adhesin.
TI  - Of staphs, streps and other things.
AB  
TI  - Pleiotropic transcriptional repressor CodY senses the intracellular pool of branched-chain amino acids in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Proteolysis is essential for supplying Lactococcus lactis with amino acids during growth in milk. Expression of the major components of the L. lactis proteolytic system, including the cell wall proteinase (PrtP), the oligopeptide transport system (Opp) and at least four intracellular peptidases (PepO1, PepN, PepC, PepDA2), was shown previously to be controlled negatively by a rich nitrogen source. The transcription of prtP, opp-pepO1, pepN and pepC genes is regulated by dipeptides in the medium. Random insertion mutants derepressed for nitrogen control in the expression of the oligopeptide transport system were isolated using an opp-lacZ fusion. A third of the mutants were targeted in the same locus. The product of the inactivated gene shared 48% identity with CodY from Bacillus subtilis, a pleiotropic repressor of the dipeptide permease operon (dpp) and several genes including genes involved in amino acid degradation and competence induction. The signal controlling CodY-dependent repression was searched for by analysing the response of the opp-lux fusion to the addition of 67 dipeptides with different amino acid compositions. Full correlation was found between the dipeptide content in branched-chain amino acids (BCAA; isoleucine, leucine or valine) and their ability to mediate the repression of opp-pepO1 expression. The repressive effect resulting from specific regulatory dipeptides was abolished in L. lactis mutants affected in terms of their transport or degradation into amino acids, showing that the signal was dependent on the BCAA pool in the cell. Lastly, the repression of opp-pepO1 expression was stronger in a mutant unable to degrade BCAAs, underlining the central role of BCAAs as a signal for CodY activity. This pattern of regulation suggests that, in L. lactis and possibly other Gram-positive bacteria, CodY is a pleiotropic repressor sensing nutritional supply as a function of the BCAA pool in the cell.
TI  - Evolution and function of the neisserial dam-replacing gene.
AB  - Phase variation through slippage-like mechanisms involving homopolymeric tracts depends in part on the absence of Dam-methylase in several pathogenic isolates of Neisseria meningitidis. In Dam-defective strains drg (dam-replacing gene), flanked by pseudo-transposable small repeated elements (SREs), replaced dam. We demonstrate that drg encodes a restriction endonuclease (NmeBII) that cleaves 5'-GmeATC-3'. drg is also present in 50% of Neisseria lactamica strains, but in most of them it is inactive because of the absence of an SRE-providing promoter. This is associated with the presence of GATmeC, suggesting an alternative restriction-modification system (RM) specific for 5'-GATC-3', similar to Sau3AI-RM of Staphylococcus aureus 3A, Lactococcus lactis KR2 and Listeria monocytogenes.
TI  - Mdt(A), a new efflux protein conferring multiple antibiotic resistance in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The mdt(A) gene, previously designated mef214, from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis plasmid pK214 encodes a protein [Mdt(A) (multiple drug transporter)] with 12 putative transmembrane segments (TMS) that contain typical motifs conserved among the efflux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily. However, it also has two C-motifs (conserved in the fifth TMS of the antiporters) and a putative ATP-binding site. Expression of the cloned mdt(A) gene decreased susceptibility to macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins, and tetracyclines in L. lactis and Escherichia coli, but not in Enterococcus faecalis or in Staphylococcus aureus. Glucose-dependent efflux of erythromycin and tetracycline was demonstrated in L. lactis and in E. coli.
TI  - Pre-inoculation enrichment procedure enhances the performance of bacteriocinogenic Lactococcus lactis meat starter culture.
AB  - Sodium nitrite and sodium chloride may inhibit growth and bacteriocinogenesis of  protective starter cultures. To reduce sensitivity of a lacticin 3147-producing starter culture to nitrite, prior to production of salami, Lactococcus lactis DPC 4275 was placed in a number of pre-inoculation treatments, containing (a) 1% glucose, (b) 2.5 ppm manganese (Mn), (c) 250 ppm magnesium (Mg), (d) 2.5 ppm manganese + 250 ppm magnesium (Mn + Mg), and held at ambient temperature for 30 min and 4 degrees C for 2 h. The growth, pH reduction, and bacteriocin production was monitored in beaker sausage over a period of 10 days at 28 degrees C, corresponding to typical salami production time, and compared to untreated starter culture. The effect of 1% tryptone and inoculum level on growth and bacteriocin production was also determined. Challenge tests were performed using Listeria innocua DPC 1770 and Staphylococcus aureus MMPR3 as target strains. All treatments gave a significantly higher (P < 0.05) initial starter level than the untreated starter. Beaker sausage inoculated with either low (10(7)) or high (10(9)) levels of starter culture, treated with Mn + Mg reached significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels by day 10 than other treatments. Trends indicate that Mn + Mg also gave best pH reduction in sausage containing the low-level starter culture, sausage and significantly lower (P < 0.05) values for sausage produced with higher inoculum. Bacteriocin production was also higher in starter culture treated with Mn, or glucose. Pre-treatment with Mg gave a 2-fold increase in bacteriocin, the addition of Mn augmenting this increase further. The incorporation of tryptone gave no additional effect. In beaker sausage, both L. innocua and S. aureus populations showed significant reductions (P < 0.05) in the presence of the bacteriocinogenic strain compared to a non-bacteriocinogenic control strain.
TI  - Leaky Lactococcus cultures that externalize enzymes and antigens independently of culture lysis and secretion and export pathways.
AB  - A novel system that leaks beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) without a requirement for secretion or export signals was developed in Lactococcus lactis by controlled expression of integrated phage holin and lysin cassettes. The late promoter of the lytic lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 is an 888-bp fragment (P(15A10)) encoding the transcriptional activator. When a high-copy-number P(15A10)::lacZ.st fusion was introduced into L. lactis strains C10, ML8, NCK203, and R1/r1t, high levels of the resultant beta-gal activity were detected in the supernatant (approximately 85% of the total beta-gal activity for C10, ML8, and NCK203 and 45% for R1/r1t). Studies showed that the phenotype resulted from expression of Tac31A from the P(15A10) fragment, which activated a homologous late promoter in prophages harbored by the lactococcal strains. Despite the high levels of beta-gal obtained in the supernatant, the growth of the strains was not significantly affected, nor was there any evidence of severe membrane damage as determined by using propidium iodide or transmission electron microscopy. Integration of the holin-lysin cassette of phage r1t, under the control of the phage phi31 late promoter, into the host genome of MG1363 yielded a similar "leaky" phenotype, indicating that holin and lysin might play a critical role in the release of beta-gal into the medium. In addition to beta-gal, tetanus toxin fragment C was successfully delivered into the growth medium by this system. Interestingly, the X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase PepXP (a dimer with a molecular mass of 176 kDa) was not delivered at significant levels outside the cell. These findings point toward the development of bacterial strains able to efficiently release relevant proteins and enzymes outside the cell in the absence of known secretion and export signals.
TI  - Heterologously expressed Staphylococcus aureus fibronectin-binding proteins are sufficient for invasion of host cells.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus invasion of mammalian cells, including epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblastic cells, critically depends on fibronectin bridging between S. aureus fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs) and the host fibronectin receptor integrin alpha(5)beta(1) (B. Sinha et al., Cell. Microbiol. 1:101-117, 1999). However, it is unknown whether this mechanism is sufficient for S. aureus invasion. To address this question, various S. aureus adhesins (FnBPA, FnBPB, and clumping factor [ClfA]) were expressed in Staphylococcus carnosus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. Both noninvasive gram-positive microorganisms are genetically distinct from S. aureus, lack any known S. aureus surface protein, and do not bind fibronectin. Transformants of S. carnosus and L. lactis harboring plasmids coding for various S. aureus surface proteins (FnBPA, FnBPB, and ClfA) functionally expressed adhesins (as determined by bacterial clumping in plasma, specific latex agglutination, Western ligand blotting, and binding to immobilized and soluble fibronectin). FnBPA or FnBPB but not of ClfA conferred invasiveness to S. carnosus and L. lactis. Invasion of 293 cells by transformants was comparable to that of strongly invasive S. aureus strain Cowan 1. Binding of soluble and immobilized fibronectin paralleled invasiveness, demonstrating that the amount of accessible surface FnBPs is rate limiting. Thus, S. aureus FnBPs confer invasiveness to noninvasive, apathogenic gram-positive cocci. Furthermore, FnBP-coated polystyrene beads were internalized by 293 cells, demonstrating that FnBPs are sufficient for invasion of host cells without the need for (S. aureus-specific) coreceptors.
TI  - In-vitro activity and killing effect of polycationic peptides on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and interactions with clinically used antibiotics.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of nisin, a 34-residue peptide produced by several Lactococcus lactis strains, and ranalexin, a 20-residue peptide isolated from the skin of the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana, alone and in combination with amoxycillin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, imipenem, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin and vancomycin was investigated against 40 nosocomial isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). All isolates were inhibited at concentrations of 1 to 32 microg/ml. Synergy was observed when the peptides were combined with other agents, with the exception of the beta-lactams. Finally, the consecutive exposures to each peptide did not result in selection of stable mutants with decreased susceptibility. Our finding show that nisin and ranalexin are active against MRSA, and that their activity is enhanced when they are combined with several antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of gram-positive bacteria based on grpE, encoded by the dnaK operon.
AB  - The dnaK operon in gram-positive bacteria includes grpE, dnaJ and, in some members, hrcA as well. Both DnaK and DnaJ have been utilized for constructing phylogenetic relationships among various organisms. Multiple copies exist for dnaK and dnaJ genes in some bacterial genera, as opposed to a single gene copy for grpE and for hrcA, according to the currently available data. Here, we present a partial protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria, derived by using the amino acid sequence identity of GrpE; the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 5S rRNA, 16S rRNA, dnaK and dnaJ sequences. Our results indicate three main groupings: two are within low-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria comprising Bacillus species and Staphylococcus aureus on the one hand and Streptococcus species/Lactococcus lactis/Enterococcus faecalis/Lactobacillus sakei on the other hand; the Mycobacterium species and Streptomyces coelicolor, belonging to the high-G+C DNA gram-positive bacteria, form the third cluster. This hierarchical arrangement is in close agreement with that obtained with 16S rRNA and DnaK sequences but not DnaJ-based phylogeny.
TI  - Development of bioactive food packaging materials using immobilised bacteriocins  lacticin 3147 and nisaplin.
AB  - Immobilisation of the bacteriocins nisin and lacticin 3147 to packaging materials was investigated. Stability of both cellulose-based bioactive inserts and anti-microbial polyethylene/polyamide pouches was examined over time. Anti-microbial activity against the indicator strain Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis HP, in addition to Listeria innocua DPC 1770 and Staphylococcus aureus MMPR3 was observed for all bacteriocin-adsorbed materials. Activity retention of the inserts showed an initial decrease in the first week of storage but remained stable for the remaining 3 months of the trial. However, adsorption of lacticin 3147 to plastic film was unsuccessful, nisin bound well and the resulting film maintained its activity for 3-month period, both at room temperature and under refrigeration. When applied to food systems, the anti-microbial packaging reduced the population of lactic acid bacteria in sliced cheese and ham stored in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) at refrigeration temperatures, thus extending the shelf life. Nisin-adsorbed bioactive inserts reduced levels of Listeria innocua by > or = 2 log units in both products, and Staphylococcus aureus by approximately 1.5 log units in cheese, and approximately 2.8 log units in ham. Similar reductions were observed in cheese vacuum-packaged in nisin-adsorbed pouches.
TI  - Protection against Staphylococcus aureus mastitis in dairy cows using a bismuth-based teat seal containing the bacteriocin, lacticin 3147.
AB  - We assessed the effectiveness of a novel dry cow treatment containing lacticin 3147 using deliberate challenge studies in lactating cows. Infection-free quarters of lactating cows were infused with Teat seal (Cross Vetpharm Group, Ltd., Dublin, Ireland) combined with the food-grade bacteriocin, lacticin 3147. Natural infection of the teat was simulated by deliberately introducing Staphylococcus aureus into the teat duct and teat sinus. Relative to control quarters, teat seal plus lacticin 3147 reduced the number of teats shedding viable cells when an inoculum of either approximately 1.7 x 10(3) or approximately 6.8 x 10(3) cfu per teat was used. In addition, the numbers of challenge organisms in those teats from which S. aureus was subsequently recovered were also reduced. However, when the concentration of bacteriocin in the teat seal formulation was reduced by approximately 50%, the number of teats shedding S. aureus cells was not reduced. These data indicate the potential for lacticin 3147 to prevent staphylococcal mastitis infections when a sufficient concentration of the bacteriocin is present. This study also highlights the application of a lactating-cow model to assess the effectiveness of antimicrobial intramammary products on mastitic cell populations.
TI  - Inactivation of the stress- and starvation-inducible gls24 operon has a pleiotrophic effect on cell morphology, stress sensitivity, and gene expression in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis induces the synthesis of at least 42 proteins during 24 h of glucose starvation. Because of its induction during carbohydrate and complete starvation (incubation in tap water) and CdCl(2) and bile salts stresses, one of these proteins (Gls24) was qualified as a "general stress protein" and was analyzed at the molecular level. Its corresponding gene, gls24, seems to be the penultimate gene of an operon composed, altogether, of six open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF preceding gls24 (orf4) showed very strong identity with gls24. The deduced polypeptides of these two genes showed similarity with a 20-kDa hypothetical protein from Lactococcus lactis and an alkaline stress protein from Staphylococcus aureus with no previously known biological significance. Data from the operon sequence and Northern analysis led to the conclusions that (i) gls24 possesses its own promoter which is especially induced at the onset of starvation and (ii) the operon promoter is stress inducible in exponential-phase cells. A mutation in the gls24 gene led to a severe reduction of growth rate and reduction of survival against 0.3% bile salts in the 24-h-starved cells compared to the wild-type strain. Moreover, the chain length of the mutant is significantly reduced during growth. These results argue strongly for a role of the protein Gls24 and/or GlsB in morphological changes and in stress tolerance in E. faecalis. Comparison of two-dimensional protein gels from wild-type cells with those from gls24 mutant cells revealed a pleiotropic effect of the mutation on gene expression. At least nine proteins were present in larger amounts in the mutant. For six of them, the corresponding N-terminal microsequence has been obtained. Three of these sequences map in genes coding for L-lactate dehydrogenase, lipoamide dehydrogenase, and pyruvate decarboxylase, all involved in pyruvate metabolism.
TI  - Thrombocidins, microbicidal proteins from human blood platelets, are C-terminal deletion products of CXC chemokines.
AB  - Antibacterial proteins are components of the innate immune system found in many organisms and produced by a variety of cell types. Human blood platelets contain a number of antibacterial proteins in their alpha-granules that are released upon thrombin activation. The present study was designed to purify these proteins obtained from human platelets and to characterize them chemically and biologically. Two antibacterial proteins were purified from platelet granules in a two-step protocol using cation exchange chromatography and continuous acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were designated thrombocidin (TC)-1 and TC-2. Characterization of these proteins using mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing revealed that TC-1 and TC-2 are variants of the CXC chemokines neutrophil-activating peptide-2 and connective tissue-activating peptide-III, respectively. TC-1 and TC-2 differ from these chemokines by a C-terminal truncation of 2 amino acids. Both TCs, but not neutrophil-activating peptide-2 and connective tissue-activating peptide-III, were bactericidal for Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactococcus lactis and fungicidal for Cryptococcus neoformans. Killing of B. subtilis by either TC appeared to be very rapid. Because TCs were unable to dissipate the membrane potential of L. lactis, the mechanism of TC-mediated killing most probably does not involve pore formation.
TI  - Expression of Staphylococcus aureus clumping factor A in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris using a new shuttle vector.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus harbors redundant adhesins mediating tissue colonization and infection. To evaluate their intrinsic role outside of the staphylococcal background, a system was designed to express them in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 1363. This bacterium is devoid of virulence factors and has a known genetic background. A new Escherichia coli-L. lactis shuttle and expression vector was constructed for this purpose. First, the high-copy-number lactococcal plasmid pIL253 was equipped with the oriColE1 origin, generating pOri253 that could replicate in E. coli. Second, the lactococcal promoters P23 or P59 were inserted at one end of the pOri253 multicloning site. Gene expression was assessed by a luciferase reporter system. The plasmid carrying P23 (named pOri23) expressed luciferase constitutively at a level 10,000 times greater than did the P59-containing plasmid. Transcription was absent in E. coli. The staphylococcal clumping factor A (clfA) gene was cloned into pOri23 and used as a model system. Lactococci carrying pOri23-clfA produced an unaltered and functional 130-kDa ClfA protein attached to their cell walls. This was indicated both by the presence of the protein in Western blots of solubilized cell walls and by the ability of ClfA-positive lactococci to clump in the presence of plasma. ClfA-positive lactococci had clumping titers (titer of 4,112) similar to those of S. aureus Newman in soluble fibrinogen and bound equally well to solid-phase fibrinogen. These experiments provide a new way to study individual staphylococcal pathogenic factors and might complement both classical knockout mutagenesis and modern in vivo expression technology and signature tag mutagenesis.
TI  - Production of a nisin-like bacteriocin by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis A164 isolated from Kimchi.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis A164 was isolated from Kimchi (Korean traditional fermented vegetables). The bacteriocin produced by strain A164 was active against closely related lactic acid bacteria and some food-borne pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium. The antimicrobial spectrum was nearly identical to that of nisin. Bacteriocin activity was not destroyed by exposure to elevated temperatures at low pH values, but the activity was lost at high pH values. This bacteriocin was inactivated by pronase E and alpha, beta-chymotrypsin, but not by trypsin, pepsin, and alpha-amylase. Cultures of L. lactis subsp. lactis A164 maintained at a constant pH of 6.0 exhibited maximum production of the bacteriocin. It was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation, sequential ion exchange chromatography, and ultrafiltration. Tricine-SDS-PAGE of purified bacteriocin gave the same molecular weight of 3.5 kDa as that of nisin. The gene encoding this bacteriocin was amplified by PCR with nisin gene-specific primers and sequenced. It showed identical sequences to the nisin gene. These results indicate that bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis A164 is a nisin-like bacteriocin.
TI  - The effect of a commercial starter culture addition on the ripening of an artisanal goat's cheese (Cameros cheese).
AB  - The evolution of physicochemical parameters, and the most important microbial groups, were determined for the following three batches of 'Cameros' goat's milk cheese during ripening: Batch R elaborated with raw milk, Batch RS elaborated with raw milk and with the addition of a starter culture, and Batch PS elaborated with pasteurized milk and with the addition of the same culture. No differences in total solids (TS) or in the content of NaCl, fat and total nitrogen (expressed as percentages of TS) were found during the ripening. The pH, fat acidity and non-protein nitrogen (NPN, expressed as a percentage of TN) showed significant differences between the batches. The inoculated batches showed the fastest drop in pH at the beginning of the ripening period, but the cheeses of Batch R showed a higher degree of lipolysis and proteolysis. The addition of a starter influenced the microbiological quality of the cheeses. Differences in the counts of Enterobacteriaceae and faecal coliforms were found between Batches R and RS after 15 days. Staphylococcus aureus increased in number during the early period of ripening and attained a population above 6 log cfu g-1 in Batch R in the period from 5 to 10 days. However, enterotoxins were not detected in this Batch. Batch R showed lower values of lactic acid bacteria at the beginning of the ripening period, but no significant differences were found between batches in the period from 5 to 15 days of ripening. At the beginning of the ripening, Lactococcus was the main lactic acid bacteria, with L. lactis lactis being predominant. After 15 days, the lactic acid bacteria counts decreased in the three batches, especially in the cheeses of Batch PS (only 2.2 log cfu g-1 was found at 60 days), as lactococci (the only lactic acid bacteria present in Batch PS) are incapable of growing under the conditions found in cheeses at the end of their ripening period. At this time, Lactobacillus was the predominant genus in Batches R and RS, with L. plantarum predominant. No lactococci were found from day 30 in Batch R and from day 40 in Batch RS. The cheeses of Batch RS received the most favourable scores from the tasting panel for all attributes judged: cut appearance, colour, aroma, taste, texture and general acceptance.
TI  - Group B streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  - Group B streptococci (GBS) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. To identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from A549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. These plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled GBS as a probe. GBS adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kDa (p50) and 57 kDa (p57). We concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of CK8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with CK8 after separation by two-dimensional PAGE; (iii) CK8 in solution bound to GBS, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from A549 lysates that bound to GBS in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled GBS bound to A549 lysate-derived CK8 that had been captured in anti-CK8-coated microtiter wells. CK8 bound to COH1-13, an acapsular mutant of COH1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. Trypsin-treated GBS did not bind to CK8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of GBS. Soluble CK8 bound to six of six GBS strains tested. Soluble CK8 also bound to Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. We hypothesize that adherence of GBS to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.
TI  - The development of TnNuc and its use for the isolation of novel secretion signals in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - We have previously used Tn917 for the identification and characterization of regulated promoters from Lactococcus lactis [Israelsen et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61 (1995) 2540-2547]. We describe here the construction of a new Tn917-transposon derivative, termed TnNuc, which includes the Staphylococcus aureus nuclease gene (nuc) as a reporter for secretion. Transposition of TnNuc into the L. lactis chromosome allows the generation of fusions in-frame with the nuc gene. TnNuc includes also lacZ, a reporter used for identification of relevant clones from the library, i.e. clones with Lac+ phenotype result from transposition of TnNuc into a functional gene on the L. lactis chromosome. The presence of a functional signal sequence at the upstream flanking region of the left repeat of the transposed element results in the detection of nuclease activity using a sensitive plate assay. TnNuc was used for the identification of novel secretion signals from L. lactis. The sequences identified included known and unknown lactococcal-secreted proteins containing either a signal peptidase-I or -II recognition sequence. In one case, the gene identified codes for a transmembrane protein. The sequences identified were used to study functionality when located in a plasmid under the control of the pH and growth phase-dependent promoter P170 [Madsen et al., Mol. Microbiol. 32 (1999) 75-87]. In all cases, concurrent secretion of nuclease was observed during induction of P170 in a fermentor.
TI  - Occurrence of nisin Z production in Lactococcus lactis BFE 1500 isolated from wara, a traditional Nigerian cheese product.
AB  - Screening for bacteriocin production of 500 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from various African fermented foods resulted in the detection of a bacteriocin producing Lactococcus lactis (BFE 1500) isolated from a dairy product called wara. The bacteriocin inhibited not only the closely related LAB, but also strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillis cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. It was heat stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees C for 15 min) and was active over a wide pH range (2-10), but highest activity was observed in the lower pH range. The bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase K, but not by other proteases. Growth kinetic assay indicated stronger growth inhibition by the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 on L. monocytogenes WS 2250 and B. cereus DSM 2301 than with the nisin A producing strain DSM 20729. Polymerase chain reaction indicated the presence of the nisin operon in strain BFE 1500 and sequencing of its structural gene showed that Lc. lactis BFE 1500 produced the natural nisin variant, nisin Z, as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. The genetic determinants for bacteriocin production in strain BFE 1500 are located on a conjugative transposon. The ability of the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 to inhibit a wide range of food-borne pathogens is of special interest for food safety, especially in the African environment with perennial problems of poor food hygiene.
TI  - In vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (Amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  - It has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. Thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. The six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules A (amylose; Sigma) and B (Culture Pro 958N). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., and strains of Eubacterium, Clostridium, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. In fact, C. butyricum and Bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. Starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides cells and were extracellular for C. butyricum. Active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on SDS-PAGE gels showed that the Bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (M(r)) weights (>160,000), medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). It was concluded that Bifidobacterium spp. and C. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.
TI  - Acquired antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from food.
AB  - Acquired antibiotic resistance, i.e. resistance genes located on conjugative or mobilizable plasmids and transposons can be found in species living in habitats (e.g. human and animal intestines) which are regularly challenged with antibiotics. Most data are available for enterococci and enteric lactobacilli. Raw material from animals (milk and meat) which are inadvertantly contaminated with fecal matters during production will carry antibiotic resistant lactic acid bacteria into the final fermented products such as raw milk cheeses and raw sausages. The discovered conjugative genetic elements of LAB isolated from animals and food are very similar to elements studied previously in pathogenic streptococci and enterococci, e.g. theta-type replicating plasmids of the pAMbeta1, pIP501-family, and transposons of the Tn916-type. Observed resistance genes include known genes like tetM, ermAM, cat, sat and vanA. A composite 29,871 bp resistance plasmid detected in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from a raw milk soft cheese contains tetS previously described in Listeria monocytogenes, cat and str from Staphylococcus aureus. Three out of five IS elements on the plasmid are almost or completely identical to IS1216 present in the vanA resistance transposon Tn1546. These data support the view that in antibiotic challenged habitats lactic acid bacteria like other bacteria participate in the communication systems which transfer resistance traits over species and genus borders. The prevalence of such bacteria with acquired resistances like enterococci is high in animals (and humans) which are regularly treated with antibiotics. The transfer of antibiotic resistant bacteria from animals into fermented and other food can be avoided if the raw substrate milk or meat is pasteurized or heat treated. Antibiotic resistance traits as selectable markers in genetic modification of lactic acid bacteria for different purposes are presently being replaced, e.g. by metabolic traits to generate food-grade vectors.
TI  - Development of a lacticin 3147-enriched whey powder with inhibitory activity against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - The broad-spectrum bacteriocin lacticin 3147, produced by Lactococcus lactis DPC3147, is inhibitory to a wide range of gram-positive food spoilage and pathogenic organisms. A 10% solution of demineralized whey powder was fermented with DPC3147 at a constant pH of 6.5. The fermentate was spray dried, and the resulting powder exhibited inhibitory activity. The ability of the lacticin 3147-enriched powder to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes Scott A and Staphylococcus aureus 10 was assessed in buffer at both acidic (pH 5) and neutral (pH 7) pH. In addition, the ability of the powder to inhibit L. monocytogenes Scott A in an infant milk formulation was assessed. Resuspension of approximately 10(8) midexponential phase L. monocytogenes Scott A cells in a 10% solution of the lacticin 3147-enriched powder resulted in a 1,000-fold reduction in viable cells at pH 5 and pH 7 after 3 h at 30 degrees C. In the case of S. aureus 10, resuspension of 2.5 x 10(7) midexponential phase cells in a 15% solution of the lacticin 3147-enriched powder at pH 5 resulted in only a 10-fold reduction in viable cell counts, compared with a 1,000-fold reduction at pH 7, following incubation for 3 h at 30 degrees C. The use of the lacticin 3147 powder in an infant milk formulation resulted in greater than a 99% kill of L. monocytogenes within 3 h at 30 degrees C. These results suggest that this bioactive lacticin 3147 food ingredient may find applications in many different foods, including those with pH close to neutrality.
TI  - Identification of genes encoding two-component lantibiotic production in Staphylococcus aureus C55 and other phage group II S. aureus strains and demonstration of an association with the exfoliative toxin B gene.
AB  - The production of exfoliative toxin B (ET-B), but not ET-A, was shown to be specifically associated with production of a highly conserved two-component lantibiotic peptide system in phage group II Staphylococcus aureus. Two previously studied but incompletely characterized S. aureus bacteriocins, staphylococcins C55 and BacR1, were found to be members of this lantibiotic system, and considerable homology was also found with the two-component Lactococcus lactis bacteriocin, lacticin 3147. sacalphaA and sacbetaA, the structural genes of the lantibiotics staphylococcins C55alpha and C55beta and two putative lantibiotic processing genes, sacM1 and sacT, were localized together with the ET-B structural gene to a single 32-kb plasmid in strain C55. Irreversible loss of both ET-B and two-component lantibiotic production occurs during laboratory passage of ET-B-positive S. aureus strains, particularly at elevated temperatures.
TI  - Lacticin 3147 displays activity in buffer against gram-positive bacterial pathogens which appear insensitive in standard plate assays.
AB  - Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis DPC3147, which has been shown to be active against a range of food-borne bacteria. The reported inhibitory range for lacticin is extended to include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Pneumococcus, Propionibacterium acne and Streptococcus mutans. This extended host range is not obvious from traditional agar plate-based methods, but reductions in bacterial cell numbers by up to 6 log10 cfu ml-1 was observed after 2 h in time-kill curve studies conducted in broth, suggesting that the bacteriocin may have potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of human infections.
TI  - Bactericidal action of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation: an in vitro investigation.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation on bacterial growth. Six different bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactococcis lactis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Deinococcus radiodurans) were exposed in vitro to various doses and energy densities of laser radiation. To exclude bacterial killing by supraphysiological heating, the temperature change in the samples during irradiation was measured. Extended antimicrobial effects of XeCl excimer-laser radiation depending on the time of radiation, the energy density of the laser beam, and the irradiated bacterial strain were observed. Reduction of bacterial growth is independent of temperature and not linked to any ablative tissue removal. In almost all cases, a 99.9% reduction of bacteria was reached by total radiation times < 100 ms. The proven antimicrobial effects of 308 nm excimer-laser radiation may be of significant clinical importance in endodontics and periodontology in the future.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Minimum inhibitory concentration of smoke wood extracts against spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms associated with foods.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of seven commercial smoke preparations (four liquid and three solid) was studied. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined against a selection of food spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms. The main smoke components were identified and quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The most effective condensate was S2. All strains except Salmonella enteritidis were inhibited by S2 with an MIC < 0.5-1.5%. Smoke extract L2 inhibited growth of Vibrio vulnificus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, L. inocua, Brochothrix thermosphacta and Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis with an MIC of < 0.2-0.8%. The condensate L3 inhibited effectively V. vulnificus, B. subtilis, L. innocua and Staph. aureus. L1, L4, S1 and S3 had no inhibitory effects at levels tested against most micro-organisms. Vibrio vulnificus was the most susceptible micro-organism to test compounds. The antimicrobial activity of smoke preparations was related to the concentration of phenols.
TI  - Evaluation of lacticin 3147 and a teat seal containing this bacteriocin for inhibition of mastitis pathogens.
AB  - Lacticin 3147 is a broad-spectrum bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis DPC3147 which is bactericidal against a range of mastitis-causing streptococci and staphylococci. In this study, both lacticin 3147 and the lantibiotic nisin were separately incorporated into an intramammary teat seal product. The seal containing lacticin 3147 exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity and might form the basis of an improved treatment for the prevention of mastitis in dry cows.
TI  - An export-specific reporter designed for gram-positive bacteria: application to Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The identification of exported proteins by fusion studies, while well developed for gram-negative bacteria, is limited for gram-positive bacteria, in part due to drawbacks of available export reporters. In this work, we demonstrate the export specificity and use of the Staphylococcus aureus secreted nuclease (Nuc) as a reporter for gram-positive bacteria. Nuc devoid of its export signal (called delta(SP)Nuc) was used to create two fusions whose locations could be differentiated. Nuclease activity was shown to require an extracellular location in Lactococcus lactis, thus demonstrating the suitability of delta(SP)Nuc to report protein export. The shuttle vector pFUN was designed to construct delta(SP)Nuc translational fusions whose expression signals are provided by inserted DNA. The capacity of delta(SP)Nuc to reveal and identify exported proteins was tested by generating an L. lactis genomic library in pFUN and by screening for Nuc activity directly in L. lactis. All delta(SP)Nuc fusions displaying a strong Nuc+ phenotype contained a classical or a lipoprotein-type signal peptide or single or multiple transmembrane stretches. The function of some of the predicted signals was confirmed by cell fractionation studies. The fusions analyzed included long (up to 455-amino-acid) segments of the exported proteins, all previously unknown in L. lactis. Homology searches indicate that several of them may be implicated in different cell surface functions, such as nutrient uptake, peptidoglycan assembly, environmental sensing, and protein folding. Our results with L. lactis show that delta(SP)Nuc is well suited to report both protein export and membrane protein topology.
TI  - A nine-residue synthetic propeptide enhances secretion efficiency of heterologous proteins in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis, a gram-positive organism widely used in the food industry, is a potential candidate for the secretion of biologically useful proteins. We examined the secretion efficiency and capacity of L. lactis by using the Staphylococcus aureus nuclease (Nuc) as a heterologous model protein. When expressed in L. lactis from an efficient lactococcal promoter and its native signal peptide, only approximately 60% of total Nuc was present in a secreted form at approximately 5 mg per liter. The remaining 40% was found in a cell-associated precursor form. The secretion efficiency was reduced further to approximately 30% by the deletion of 17 residues of the Nuc native propeptide (resulting in NucT). We identified a modification which improved secretion efficiency of both native Nuc and NucT. A 9-residue synthetic propeptide, LEISSTCDA, which adds two negative charges at the +2 and +8 positions, was fused immediately after the signal peptide cleavage site. In the case of Nuc, secretion efficiency was increased to approximately 80% by LEISSTCDA insertion without altering the signal peptide cleavage site, and the yield was increased two- to fourfold (up to approximately 20 mg per liter). The improvement of NucT secretion efficiency was even more marked and rose from 30 to 90%. Similarly, the secretion efficiency of a third protein, the alpha-amylase of Bacillus stearothermophilus, was also improved by LEISSTCDA. These data indicate that the LEISSTCDA synthetic propeptide improves secretion of different heterologous proteins in L. lactis.
TI  - Functional display of a heterologous protein on the surface of Lactococcus lactis by means of the cell wall anchor of Staphylococcus aureus protein A.
AB  - In this study, we showed that the cell wall anchor of protein A from Staphylococcus aureus is functional in the food-grade organism Lactococcus lactis. A fusion protein composed of the lactococcal Usp45 secretion signal peptide, streptavidin monomer, and the S. aureus protein A anchor became covalently attached to the peptidoglycan when expressed in L. lactis. The streptavidin moiety of the fusion protein was functionally exposed at the cellular surface. L. lactis cells expressing the anchored fusion polypeptide could be specifically immobilized on a biotinylated alkaline phosphatase-coated polystyrene support.
TI  - Food-grade controlled lysis of Lactococcus lactis for accelerated cheese ripening.
AB  - An attractive approach to accelerate cheese ripening is to induce lysis of Lactococcus lactis starter strains for facilitated release of intracellular enzymes involvement in flavor formation. Controlled expression of the lytic genes lytA and lytH, which encode the lysin and the holin proteins of the lactococcal bacteriophage phi US3, respectively, was accomplished by application of a food-grade nisin-inducible expression system. Simultaneous production of lysin and holin is essential to obtain efficient lysis and concomitant release of intracellular enzymes as exemplified by complete release of the debittering intracellular aminopeptidase N. Production of holin alone leads to partial lysis of the host cells, whereas production of lysin alone does not cause significant lysis. Model cheese experiments in which the inducible holinlysin overproducing strain was used showed a fourfold increase in release of L-Lactate dehydrogenase activity into the curd relative to the control strain and the holin-overproducing strain, demonstrating the suitability of the system for cheese applications.
TI  - The structure of enzyme IIAlactose from Lactococcus lactis reveals a new fold and points to possible interactions of a multicomponent system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is responsible for the binding, transmembrane transport and phosphorylation of numerous sugar substrates. The system is also involved in the regulation of a variety of metabolic and transcriptional processes. The PTS consists of two non-specific energy coupling components, enzyme I and a heat stable phosphocarrier protein (HPr), as well as several sugar-specific multiprotein permeases known as enzymes II. In most cases, enzymes IIA and IIB are located in the cytoplasm, while enzyme IIC acts as a membrane channel. Enzyme IIAlactose belongs to the lactose/cellobiose-specific family of enzymes II, one of four functionally and structurally distinct groups. The protein, which normally functions as a trimer, is believed to separate into its subunits after phosphorylation. RESULTS: The crystal structure of the trimeric enzyme IIAlactose from Lactococcus lactis has been determined at 2.3 A resolution. The subunits of the enzyme, related to each other by the inherent threefold rotational symmetry, possess interesting structural features such as coiled-coil-like packing and a methionine cluster. The subunits each comprise three helices (I, II and III) and pack against each other forming a nine-helix bundle. This helical bundle is stabilized by a centrally located metal ion and also encloses a hydrophobic cavity. The three phosphorylation sites (His78 on each monomer) are located in helices III and their sidechains protrude into a large groove between helices I and II of the neighbouring subunits. A model of the complex between phosphorylated HPr and enzyme IIAlactose has been constructed. CONCLUSIONS: Enzyme IIAlactose is the first representative of the family of lactose/cellobiose-specific enzymes IIA for which a three-dimensional structure has been determined. Some of its structural features, like the presence of two histidine residues at the active site, seem to be common to all enzymes no overall structural homology is observed to any PTS proteins or to any other proteins in the Protein Data Bank. Enzyme IIAlactose shows surface complementarity to the phosphorylated form of HPr and several energetically favourable interactions between the two molecules can be predicted.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the replicon of the Pediococcus pentosaceus 43200 pediocin A plasmid pMD136.
AB  - The pediocin A-encoding plasmid of Pediococcus pentosaceus 43200, pMD136, was characterized by restriction enzyme analysis. Analysis of its replicon was facilitated by the construction of a probe vector consisting of the Escherichia coli plasmid pSP72 and the cat gene from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pC194. The replication region of pMD136 was localized on a 1.6-kb EcoRI/BglII fragment. Sequencing analysis revealed a non-coding region, repA, spanning the first 440 bp, followed by an open reading frame, repB, encoding a putative protein of 390 amino acids. The non-coding region contained two sets of 6-bp and two sets of 22-bp direct repeats and two sets of inverted repeats upstream of the open reading frame. Strong homology of the isolated replicon was found to theta-type replicons of Lactococcus lactis plasmids. Segregational stability assay suggested at least two regions as potentially involved in the stabilization of pMD136. The plasmid's strong homology to other theta-type replicons and its relatively high stability suggest that pMD136 belongs to the widespread family of theta-replication plasmids.
TI  - Cloning of a gene encoding nisin resistance from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis M189 which is transcribed from an extended 210 promoter.
AB  - A 56-kb plasmid was identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (L. lactis) M189 which encodes resistance to nisin (Nis(R)) following mobilization of the plasmid into L. lactis LM0230. The Nis(R) determinant was localized on a 1.6-kb HindIII fragment by DNA restriction fragment deletion and subcloning. An open reading frame (ORF) of 957 bases was identified by sequence analysis and its transcription start site was mapped by primer extension. The ORF is flanked by two regions which exhibit complete homology to parts of the inverted repeat sequences of IS981 and ISS1T. The promoter for transcription was found to consist of an extended -10 site (TgTGtTATAAT) that lacks a -35 site. Function of the extended -10 promoter was demonstrated by its ability to express the promoterless cat gene from Staphylococcus aureus. Base substitution analysis revealed that the TgTGt extension is essential for promoter efficiency in L. lactis.
TI  - The lac operon of Lactobacillus casei contains lacT, a gene coding for a protein  of the Bg1G family of transcriptional antiterminators.
AB  - The 5' region of the lac operon of Lactobacillus casei has been investigated. An  open reading frame of 293 codons, designated lacT, was identified upstream of lacE. The gene product encoded by lacT is related to the family of transcriptional antiterminator proteins, which includes BglG from Escherichia coli, ArbG from Erwinia chrysanthemi, SacT, SacY, and LicT from Bacillus subtilis, and BglR from Lactococcus lactis. Amino acid sequence identities range from 35 to 24%, while similarities range from 56 to 47%. The transcriptional start site of the lac operon was identified upstream of lacT. The corresponding mRNA would contain in the 5' region a sequence with high similarity to the consensus RNA binding site of transcriptional antiterminators overlapping a sequence capable of folding into a structure that resembles a rho-independent terminator. LacT was shown to be active as an antiterminator in a B. subtilis test system using the sacB target sequence. lacT directly precedes lacEGF, the genes coding for enzyme IICB, phospho-beta-galactosidase, and enzyme IIA, and these genes are followed by a sequence that appears to encode a second rho-independent transcription terminator-like structure. Northern hybridizations with probes against lacT, lacE, and lacF revealed transcripts of similar sizes for the lac mRNAs of several L. casei strains. Since the length of the lac mRNA is just sufficient to contain lacTEGF, we conclude that the lac operon of L. casei does not contain the genes of the accessory tagatose-6-phosphate pathway as occurs in the lac operons of Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Genetic analysis of regions involved in replication and cadmium resistance of the plasmid pND302 from Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The 8.8-kb Lactococcus lactis plasmid pND302 encodes resistance to cadmium (CdR). Regions of pND302 involved in replication and CdR were subcloned and sequenced. The replication region is localized on a 1.5-kb region and consists of an open reading frame (repB) preceded by a noncoding AT-rich sequence (ori) which is highly homologous to lactococcal theta-type replicons. The CdR determinant is localized on a 2.9-kb region and encodes putative proteins similar to the Cd(2+)-specific P-type efflux ATPase (CadA) and the transcriptional regulatory repressor (CadC) identified in Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus firmus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Similar CdR determinants were also detected by PCR in other CdR plasmids isolated from different L. lactis strains.
TI  - Production of nisin-like bacteriocins by Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from vegetables.
AB  - Four bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from vegetables were identified as Lactococcus lactis strains on the basis of physiological and biochemical characteristics, carbohydrate fermentation patterns and analysis of total soluble protein pattern by SDS PAGE. The bacteriocins had a wide spectrum of activity as antagonism was detected not only towards a variety of lactic acid bacteria, but also to Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes. These bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degree C for 15 minutes and showed highest activity at low pH (<5.0). They were inactivated by the proteolytic enzymes alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase K, but not by lipase, alpha-amylase, catalase or lysozyme. These bacteriocinogenic Lactococcus strains were all immune to the bacteriocins produced as well as to commercial nisin. Bacteriocin producer culture supernatants showed a high degree (70 or 100%) of cross-reactivity in the nisin ELISA, suggesting similarity of the produced bacteriocins to nisin. The potential application of bacteriocin producing lactococci of vegetable origin for safety assurance of vegetable foods and controlling vegetable fermentations is discussed.
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of pWC1, a pC194-type rolling circle replicon in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - A 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pFX3 (rolling circle, pE194-type) or pCI305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. The plasmid, pWC1, was compatible with both pCI3340 (a pCI305 derivative) and pFX3 in L. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. Sequence analysis of pWC1 showed one major ORF encoding a protein with a deduced size of 316 amino acids (aa). Database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pFX- and pCI-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pC194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. A pC194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in L. lactis. Further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pWC1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. The chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pC194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pWC1 to give pCP12. The host range of pCP12 included Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli. Both pCP12 and to a lesser extent pWC1 generated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in L. lactis. A possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pWC1 and by comparing levels of ssDNA produced by pCP12 deletion derivatives. The pWC1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the eps (Exopolysaccharide) gene cluster from Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6.
AB  - We report the identification and characterization of the eps gene cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus Sfi6 required for exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis. This report is the first genetic work concerning EPS production in a food microorganism. The EPS secreted by this strain consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->3)-[alpha-D-Galp-(1-->6)]-beta-D- D-Galp-(1-->3)-alpha-D-Galp-D-GalpNAc-(1-->. The genetic locus The genetic locus was identified by Tn916 mutagenesis in combination with a plate assay to identify Eps mutants. Sequence analysis of the gene region, which was obtained from subclones of a genomic library of Sfi6, revealed a 15.25-kb region encoding 15 open reading frames. EPS expression in the non-EPS-producing heterologous host, Lactococcus lactis MG1363, showed that within the 15.25-kb region, a region with a size of 14.52 kb encoding the 13 genes epsA to epsM was capable of directing EPS synthesis and secretion in this host. Homology searches of the predicted proteins in the Swiss-Prot database revealed high homology (40 to 68% identity) for epsA, B, C, D, and E and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Moderate to low homology (37 to 18% identity) was detected for epsB, D, F, and H and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus for epsC, D, and E and the genes involved in exopolysaccharide I (EPSI) synthesis in Rhizobium meliloti for epsC to epsJ and the genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis in members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and finally for eps K and lipB of Neisseria meningitidis. Genes (epsJ, epsL, and epsM) for which the predicted proteins showed little or no homology with proteins in the Swiss-Prot database were shown to be involved in EPS synthesis by single-crossover gene disruption experiments.
TI  - [Isolation and reassociation of acetogen and methanogen in a syntrophobic coculture degrading butyrate anaerobically].
AB  - Anaerobic coculture BF2 which degraded butyrate into acetate and produced methane was isolated from granular methanogenic sludge. The coculture is associated syntrophically the Syntrophomonas subsp. saponavida strain CF2 with Methanobacterium formicicum strain MF2 and appeared to degraded C4 approximately C18 fatty acids including isobutyrate. The optimal temperature and pH for growth was 37 degrees C and 7.7 respectively. The strain CF2 was obtained in pure culture with crotonate as substrate and produces acetate and butyrate. The doubling time of strain CF2 in crotonate media was about 20 hours. Strain CF2 is Gram negative, slightly curved 0.2 approximately 0.3 x 2.0 approximately 3.0 micron with round ends, motile by lateral flagellation at the concave side, non sporeforming. With a hydrogen scavenging organism, such as Methanospillum hungatei JF1, Methanobacterium formicicum 1535, Methanobrevibacterium bryantii 1125 and Desulfovibrio sp. B11, the strain CF2 paired up and the defined coculture degraded butyrate to acetate. When the strain CF2 associated with the original accompanist, Methanobacterium formicius strain MF2, the reassociated couculture degraded butyrate to acetate and produced methane again.
TI  - An archaeal gene upstream of grpE different from eubacterial counterparts.
AB  - In some eubacteria with a dnaK locus in which grpE is close upstream of dnaK, grpE is preceded by an open reading frame (orf) believed to be a heat-shock gene. We also found an orf, orf16, upstream of grpE in the archaeon Methanosarcina mazei S-6, but this gene differs from the eubacterial counterpart: it is shorter, does not respond to a temperature upshift as heat-shock genes do, and the deduced protein Orf16, does not resemble the proteins coded by the eubacterial equivalents. orf16 is expressed monocistronically, with a transcription initiation site 24 bases upstream of the translation start codon, 22 bases downstream of a putative promoter identical to the consensus promoter for genes in methanogens. This initiation site is used by heat-shocked and non-heat-shocked cells in the two morphologic stages of M. mazei S-6 tested, i.e., packets and single cells. Three transcription termination sites were identified, one of which is detectable only in non-heat-shocked cells. Data from comparative analyses of the Orf16 deduced amino acid sequence and those of other known proteins, as well as the apparent biochemical characteristics of Orf16, suggest that the latter is a membrane molecule.
TI  - Structural and functional analysis of the single-strand origin of replication from the lactococcal plasmid pWV01.
AB  - The single-strand origin (SSO) of the rolling-circle (RC), broad-host-range lactococcal plasmid pWVO1 was functionally characterized. The activity of this SSO in the conversion of single-stranded DNA to double-stranded DNA was tested both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the effect of this SSO on plasmid maintenance was determined. The functional pWVO1 SSO comprises a 250 bp region, containing two inverted repeats (IRs). The activity of each IR was tested, separately and in combination, in a plasmid derivative that was otherwise completely devoid of structures that might function as SSO. One of the IRs (IR I) showed some homology with other previously described SSOs of the SSOA type, as well as with the conversion signal of the Escherichia coli phage phi X174. This IR was shown to have a partial, RNA polymerase-independent activity in complementary strand synthesis, both in vivo and in vitro. The second IR, which had no activity of its own, was required for full SSO activity, both in vivo and in vitro. The conversion of single-stranded DNA to the double-stranded form by the complete SSO was only partly sensitive to inhibition by rifampicin, indicating the existence of an RNA polymerase-independent pathway for this event. The results suggest that the pWVO1 SSO can be activated by two different routes: an RNA polymerase-dependent one (requiring the entire SSO), and an RNA polymerase-independent one (requiring only IR I).
TI  - Characterization of diacetin B, a bacteriocin from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bv. diacetylactis UL720.
AB  - Fourteen Lactococcus lactis strains showing inhibitory activity against Listeria  innocua SICC 4202 were isolated from different French raw milks and raw milk cheeses and screened for bacteriocin production by the triple layer method under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Three bacteriocinogenic strains (two Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis bv. diacetylactis UL719 and UL720 and one Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis UL730) were selected for their high capacity to inhibit the growth of various food pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and clostridial strains. The inhibitory compounds from these three strains are inactivated by selected proteases, indicating their protein nature. They retained their antibacterial activity after heat treatments of 100 degrees C for 60 min and 121 degrees C for 20 min, and in the pH range from 2 to 11. The bacteriocin diacetin B produced by strain UL720 has been purified by a pH-dependent adsorption-desorption procedure, followed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, with a yield of 1.25% of the original activity. Mass spectrometry analysis indicates that the pure peptide has a molecular mass of 4292.32 or 4490.28 Da, while amino acid sequencing allowed the identification of the primary structure of the bacteriocin composed of 37 amino acid residues. The structure of the peptide did not show similarity with other known bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Distribution of proteins similar to IIIManH and IIIManL of the Streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  - In Streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins EI and HPr, the specific membrane-bound IIIMan, and two forms of a protein called IIIMan, with molecular weights of 38,900 (IIIManH) and 35,200 (IIIManL), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the membrane. Several lines of evidence suggest that IIIManH and/or IIIManL are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. To determine whether other bacteria possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Three approaches were used to determine whether the IIIMan proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-IIIManH and anti-IIIManH rabbit polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of PEP-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-IIIMan antibodies of the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. Only the species S. salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of IIIMan. Fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. In the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of PEP. No such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. A III(Man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in Lactobacillus casei by Western blot experiments as well as by PEP-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-III(Man) antibodies was detected in Lactococcus lactis. In several cases, the involvement of these putative III(Man) proteins in the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-III(Man) antibodies. No proteins cross-reacting with anti-III(Man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and E. coli. In S. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. This protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of PEP.
TI  - Utilization of cheddar cheese containing nisin as an antimicrobial agent in other foods.
AB  - Cheddar cheese made with nisin-producing lactococci contained between 400 and 1200 IU of nisin per gram of cheese. Cultures used were Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris JS102, a nisin-producing transconjugant developed in the laboratories of Dr. L.L. McKay and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis NCDO 1404 obtained from the National Collection of Food Bacteria, Reading, England. Pasteurized process cheese spreads with 53% and 60% moisture and 0, 301 and 387 IU nisin/g were manufactured and inoculated with 2000 spores of Clostridium sporogenes PA 3679 during manufacture. The heat process did not reduce nisin activity in the cheese spreads. The spreads were incubated at 22 degrees and 37 degrees C for 90 days. Spoilage was detected by the presence of gas and/or odor in the packages. The shelf-life of the nisin-containing cheese spreads was significantly greater than that of the control cheese spreads at the lower temperature at both moisture levels, whereas the keeping quality of the higher moisture cheeses at the higher temperature was not significantly different. Club cheese or cold pack cheese spreads with moisture levels of 44% and 60% and 0, 100 and 300 IU nisin/g were made. These cold processed cheese spreads were inoculated with 1000 cfu per g of Listeria monocytogenes V7, Staphylococcus aureus 196E and spores of C. sporogenes PA 3679. Heat shocked spores of PA 3769 at the same number were added to separate lots of the cheese spread. The cold pack cheese spreads were incubated at 23 degrees and 37 degrees C for up to 8 weeks. Samples were taken weekly and analyzed for surviving organisms. Significant reductions in numbers of the non-sporeforming test microbes were noted at both temperatures, at both moisture levels and both levels of nisin. Heat shocking the spores was needed to show reduction in numbers during the storage of the cold pack cheese spreads. The data obtained in this study suggest that the use of nisin-containing cheese as an ingredient in pasteurized process cheese or cold pack cheese spreads could be an effective method of controlling the growth of undesirable microorganisms in these processed foods.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and structural organization of the small, broad-host-range plasmid pCI411 from Leuconostoc lactis 533.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Leuconostoc lactis 533 cryptic plasmid pCI411 (2926 bp) was determined. Analysis revealed the presence of three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF 1 was capable of encoding a 24.9 kDa peptide which shared homology with the replication initiation protein (RepB) from a number of Gram-positive rolling circle plasmids. ORF 2 could encode a peptide of 6.6 kDa which was homologous to the RepC protein of the lactococcal plasmid pWV01. A function could not be assigned to ORF 3, which was capable of encoding a 12.1 kDa peptide. Transcription-translation analysis indicated the presence of three peptides of the predicted molecular masses. A putative double strand origin of replication (DSO) was identified which showed strong similarity with the DSO of a number of Gram-positive plasmids including pE194 from Staphylococcus. Structural analysis identified a number of direct and indirect repeats in addition to putative recombination-specific sites (RSA and RSB) in the non-coding region of pCI411. The observed characteristics suggest that this plasmid replicates using the rolling circle mechanism. pCI411, which could be introduced into Leuconostoc, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Bacillus is the first plasmid from the genus Leuconostoc to be characterized in such detail.
TI  - A variant of the staphylococcal chloramphenicol resistance plasmid pC194 with enhanced ability to transform Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  - In our attempts to transform Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis with pC194, a staphylococcal chloramphenicol resistance plasmid, only a few transformants could be obtained and only when relatively large amounts of plasmid DNA were used. However, when pC194 DNA from lactococcal transformants was introduced back to Staphylococcus aureus and reisolated, it could be retransformed into L. lactis at substantially higher frequencies. It was concluded that pC194 had undergone mutation expanding its host range. By exchanging DNA fragments between the original pC194 and the variant transforming L. lactis (named pVS41), the mutation could tentatively be located within the 1.1-kbp AccI-HaeIII fragment. Comparison of the DNA sequences in the vicinity of the replication plus-origin revealed the formation of an "opal" stop codon (TGA) apparently interrupting the synthesis of the putative protein C for which no function has been described. Cloning this mutation within a 194 bp AccI-MspI fragment on pC194 made this plasmid able to transform L. lactis. Whether the mutation somehow affects functions controlling plasmid host-specificity, or whether the extended host range reflects, for example, mutational inactivation of some lactococcal restriction site, cannot yet be stated on the basis of these data.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured Indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  - Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus laterosporus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. The effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. This study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
TI  - 6-Phospho-beta-galactosidases of gram-positive and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B of gram-negative bacteria: comparison of structure and function by kinetic and immunological methods and mutagenesis of the lacG gene of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase of Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus casei and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B of Escherichia coli build a subfamily inside a greater enzyme family, named the glycosal hydrolase family 1, which, in addition, contains nine beta-glycosidases of different origins. Kinetic and immunological evidence is provided in this report which strengthens the relationship of the four 6-phospho-beta-glycosidases. It is shown that the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidases and 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B are able to split aromatic beta-galactoside phosphates and beta-glucoside phosphates. The turnover numbers of hydrolysis of substrates with different epimerization at C-4 of the glycon vary up to 15-fold only. Two polyclonal antisera, one derived against the native 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase from S. aureus and the other derived against the 6-phospho-beta-glucosidase B, cross-reacted with both enzymes. Peptides of the proteins were separated by reverse phase HPLC. The cross-reacting peptides were sequenced and shown to be localized at almost the same position in the aligned primary structures of both enzymes. An insertion of nine amino acids near these antigenic domains is unique for the 6-phospho-beta-glycosidases and missing within the sequences of the beta-glycoside-specific members of the family. The lacG gene of a 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase negative S. aureus mutant was cloned into E. coli and sequenced. In the totally inactive mutant protein only the glycine at position 332 was changed to an arginine. This amino acid is part of the sequence insertion near the antigenic domain reacting with both antisera.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Isolation, characterization and nucleotide sequence of the Streptococcus mutans lactose-specific enzyme II (lacE) gene of the PTS and the phospho-beta-galactosidase (lacG) gene.
AB  - The lacE and lacG genes from Streptococcus mutans have been isolated and characterized, and their nucleotide sequence has been determined. The lacE gene encodes the lactose-specific Enzyme II component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). The lacG gene encodes the phospho-beta-galactosidase which cleaves the lactose phosphate that is formed by the lactose PTS. The S. mutans lacE and lacG genes are located in the same operon as the tagatose genes. S. mutans metabolizes lactose via the tagatose phosphate pathway. The deduced LacE and LacG proteins of S. mutans display high homology with the corresponding proteins from Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus casei.
TI  - Detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  - Forty bacteriocin-producing (Bac+) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. Of the 40 Bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). By direct plating, Bac+ LAB were detected at levels up to 2.4 x 10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. The Bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, SDS-PAGE protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; SDS-PAGE proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. Differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique Bac+ isolates. Bac+ LAB included Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Lb. curvatus (four strains) and Lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Some Lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine Gram-positive genera. Lb. curvatus FS47 and FS65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees C; however, Lc. lactis FS56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. The high incidence of Bac+ LAB detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of Bac+ LAB that occur as natural contaminants. These data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.
TI  - Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the lacR, lacABCD, and lacFE genes encoding the repressor, tagatose 6-phosphate gene cluster, and sugar-specific phosphotransferase system components of the lactose operon of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of lacRABCDF and partial nucleotide sequence of lacE from the lactose operon of Streptococcus mutans are presented. Comparison of the streptococcal lac determinants with those of Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis indicate exceptional protein and nucleotide identity. The deduced polypeptides also demonstrate significant, but lower, sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose proteins of Lactobacillus casei. Additionally, LacR has sequence homology with the repressor (DeoR) of the Escherichia coli deoxyribonucleotide operon, while LacC is similar to phosphokinases (FruK and PfkB) from E. coli. The primary translation products of the lacRABCDFE genes are polypeptides of 251 (M(r) 28,713), 142 (M(r) 15,610), 171 (M(r) 18,950), 310 (M(r) 33,368), 325 (M(r) 36,495), 104 (M(r) 11,401), and 123 (NH2-terminal) amino acids, respectively. As inferred from their direct homology to the staphylococcal lac genes, these determinants would encode the repressor of the streptococcal lactose operon (LacR), galactose-6-phosphate isomerase (LacA and LacB), tagatose-6-phosphate kinase (LacC), tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (LacD), and the sugar-specific components enzyme III-lactose (LacF) and enzyme II-lactose (LacE) of the S. mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. The nucleotide sequence encompassing the S. mutans lac promoter appears to contain repeat elements analogous to those of S. aureus, suggesting that repression and catabolite repression of the lactose operons may be similar in these organisms.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans serotype c tagatose 6-phosphate pathway gene cluster.
AB  - DNA cloned into Escherichia coli K-12 from a serotype c strain of Streptococcus mutans encodes three enzyme activities for galactose utilization via the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway: galactose 6-phosphate isomerase, tagatose 6-phosphate kinase, and tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. The genes coding for the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway were located on a 3.28-kb HindIII DNA fragment. Analysis of the tagatose proteins expressed by recombinant plasmids in minicells was used to determine the sizes of the various gene products. Mutagenesis of these plasmids with transposon Tn5 was used to determine the order of the tagatose genes. Tagatose 6-phosphate isomerase appears to be composed of 14- and 19-kDa subunits. The sizes of the kinase and aldolase were found to be 34 and 36 kDa, respectively. These values correspond to those reported previously for the tagatose pathway enzymes in Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis.
TI  - Antibacterial and antiviral activity of camel milk protective proteins.
AB  - Lysozyme (LZ), lactoferrin (LF), lactoperoxidase (LP), immunoglobulin G and secretory immunoglobulin A were extracted from camel milk. The activity of these protective proteins was assayed against Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium and rotavirus. Comparative activities of egg white LZ, bovine LZ and bovine LF are also presented. The antibacterial activity spectrum of camel milk LZ was similar to that of egg white LZ, and differed from bovine milk LZ. Bovine and camel milk LF antibacterial activity spectra were similar. The camel milk LP was bacteriostatic against the Gram-positive strains and was bactericidal against Gram-negative cultures. The immunoglobulins had little effect against the bacteria but high titres of antibodies against rotavirus were found in camel milk. The LP system was ineffective against rotavirus.
TI  - Lactose metabolism by Staphylococcus aureus: characterization of lacABCD, the structural genes of the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway.
AB  - The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the lacA and lacB genes of the Staphylococcus aureus lactose operon (lacABCDFEG) are presented. The primary translation products are polypeptides of 142 (Mr = 15,425) and 171 (Mr = 18,953) amino acids, respectively. The lacABCD loci were shown to encode enzymes of the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway through both in vitro studies and complementation analysis in Escherichia coli. A serum aldolase assay, modified to allow detection of the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway enzymes utilizing galactose 6-phosphate or fructose phosphate analogs as substrate, is described. Expression of both lacA and lacB was required for galactose 6-phosphate isomerase activity. LacC (34 kDa) demonstrated tagatose 6-phosphate kinase activity and was found to share significant homology with LacC from Lactococcus lactis and with both the minor 6-phosphofructokinase (PfkB) and 1-phosphofructokinase (FruK) from E. coli. Detection of tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase activity was dependent on expression of the 36-kDa protein specified by lacD. The LacD protein is highly homologous with LacD of L. lactis. Thus, the lacABCD genes comprise the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway and are cotranscribed with genes lacFEG, which specify proteins for transport and cleavage of lactose in S. aureus.
TI  - The behavior of selected microorganisms during the manufacture of high moisture Jack cheeses from ultrafiltered milk.
AB  - Whole milk was pasteurized and concentrated two times by ultrafiltration. Starter cultures, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, were propagated in either reconstituted skim milk, two times UF retentate, or UF permeate, or a direct vat system was used for the starter culture. The cheese milk was simultaneously inoculated with starter culture and Pseudomonas fragi 4973, Staphylococcus aureus 196E, and Salmonella typhimurium var. Hillfarm. Control whole milk, UF control milk, inoculated whole milk, and inoculated UF milk were made into Monterey Jack cheese using traditional procedures. The process of cheese manufacture was followed by determination of pH, titratable acidity, and microbial population levels. The cheeses were stored for 6 mo and analyzed every month for percentage solids and microbial population levels. Generally, numbers of contaminant microbes increased at a similar rate during manufacture in all cheeses. During the 6-mo ripening period, bacterial starter culture population levels remained high, psychrotrophs declined slowly, Staphylococcus levels remained stable, and Salmonella populations decreased. No Staphylococcus enterotoxin was detected by reverse passive latex agglutination assay.
TI  - Shuttle vectors containing a multiple cloning site and a lacZ alpha gene for conjugal transfer of DNA from Escherichia coli to gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The mobilizable shuttle cloning vectors, pAT18 and pAT19, are composed of: (i) the replication origins of pUC and of the broad-host-range enterococcal plasmid pAM beta 1; (ii) an erythromycin-resistance-encoding gene expressed in Gram- and Gram+ bacteria; (iii) the transfer origin of the IncP plasmid RK2; and (iv) the multiple cloning site and the lacZ alpha reporter gene of pUC18 (pAT18) and pUC19 (pAT19). These 6.6-kb plasmids contain ten unique cloning sites that allow screening of derivatives containing DNA inserts by alpha-complementation in Escherichia coli carrying the lacZ delta M15 deletion, and can be efficiently mobilized by self-transferable IncP plasmids co-resident in the E. coli donors. Plasmids pAT18, pAT19 and recombinant derivatives have been successfully transferred by conjugation from E. coli to Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, and Staphylococcus aureus at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9). The presence of a restriction system in the recipient dramatically affects (by three orders of magnitude) the efficiency of conjugal transfer of these vectors from E. coli to Gram+ bacteria.
TI  - Molecular cloning, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway gene cluster of the lactose operon of Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The tagatose 6-phosphate pathway gene cluster (lacABCD) encoding galactose-6-phosphate isomerase, tagatose-6-phosphate kinase, and tagatose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MG1820 has been characterized by cloning, nucleotide sequence analysis, and enzyme assays. Transcription studies showed that the four tagatose 6-phosphate pathway genes are the first genes of the lactose-inducible lactose-phosphotransferase operon consisting of the lacABCDFEGX genes. Using a T7 expression system, it could be shown that the lacA, lacB, lacC, and lacD genes code for proteins with apparent molecular masses of 15, 19, 33, and 36 kDa, respectively. Cell-free extracts of induced and noninduced Escherichia coli cells expressing the lacABCD genes were used to determine the functions of the encoded proteins. Expression of both lacA and lacB was required to obtain galactose-6-phosphate isomerase activity. The lacC gene codes for tagatose-6-phosphate kinase, the deduced amino sequence of which is similar to that of E. coli Pfk-2 phosphofructokinase, and Staphylococcus aureus LacC protein. The tagatose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase is encoded by the lacD gene, and its deduced primary sequence, which is homologous to that of the S. aureus LacD protein, predicts an amino acid composition which is virtually identical to that of the previously purified L. lactis E8 tagatose-1,6-diphosphate aldolase.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - Molecular cloning and DNA sequence of lacE, the gene encoding the lactose-specific enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system of Lactobacillus casei. Evidence that a cysteine residue is essential for sugar phosphorylation.
AB  - The gene coding for the lactose-specific Enzyme II of the Lactobacillus casei phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system, lacE, has been isolated by molecular cloning and expressed in Escherichia coli. The DNA sequence of the lacE gene and the deduced amino acid sequence are presented. The putative translation product comprises a hydrophobic protein of 577 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 62,350 Da. The deduced polypeptide has a high degree of sequence similarity with the corresponding lactose-specific enzymes II of Staphylococcus aureus and Lactococcus lactis. The sequence surrounding cysteine 483 was strongly conserved in the three proteins. The identity of the lacE product as the Enzyme IIlacL.casei was demonstrated by in vitro lactose phosphorylation assays using the protein expressed in E. coli. Single replacement of each of the histidine and cysteine residues by site-directed mutagenesis pointed to cysteine 483 as an amino acid residue essential for the phosphoryl group transfer reaction.
TI  - Characterization of the lactose-specific enzymes of the phosphotransferase system in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The plasmid-encoded lactose genes of the Lactococcus lactis phosphotransferase system encoding Enzyme IIIlac (lacF) and Enzyme IIlac (lacE) have been identified and cloned in Escherichia coli and L. lactis. Nucleotide sequence and transcription analysis showed that these genes are organized into a lactose-inducible operon with the gene order lacF-lacE-lacG-lacX, the latter two genes encoding phospho-beta-galactosidase and a 34-kDa protein with an unknown function, respectively. The lac-operon is immediately followed by an IS element that is homologous to ISS1. Enzyme IIIlac was purified from L. lactis and determination of its NH2-terminal sequence demonstrated that the lacF gene starts with a TTG codon and encodes a 105 amino acid protein (Mr = 11416). Cross-linking studies with the purified enzyme showed that Enzyme IIIlac is active as a trimer. A mutant lacF gene was identified in strain YP2-5 and appeared to encode Enzyme IIIlac containing the missense mutation G18E. The lacF gene could be expressed under control of vector-located promoter sequences resulting in overproduction of Enzyme IIIlac in E. coli and complementation of the L. lactis lacF mutant YP2-5. The deduced amino acid sequence of Enzyme IIlac consists of 586 amino acids (Mr = 61562) and shows the characteristics of a hydrophobic, integral membrane protein. The deduced primary structures of the L. lactis Enzyme IIIlac and Enzyme IIlac are homologous to those of Staphylococcus aureus (72 and 71% identity, respectively) and Lactobacillus casei (48 and 47% identity, respectively). In contrast, the organization of the lactose genes differs significantly between those Gram-positive bacteria. Heterogramic homology in specific domains was observed between the derived amino acid sequences of the lactose-specific enzymes and that of E. coli Enzyme IIIcel and Enzyme IIcel, which suggest a common function in the transport and phosphorylation of these structurally related beta-glucosides.
TI  - Plus-origin mapping of single-stranded DNA plasmid pE194 and nick site homologies with other plasmids.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pE194 manifests a natural thermosensitivity for replication and can be established in several species, both gram positive and gram negative, thus making it attractive for use as a delivery vector. Like most characterized plasmids of gram-positive bacteria, pE194 generates single-stranded DNA. The direction of pE194 replication is clockwise, as determined by the strandedness of free single-stranded DNA. Significant homology exists between a 50-base-pair sequence in the origin of pE194 and sequences present in plasmids pMV158 (Streptococcus agalactiae), pADB201 (Mycoplasma mycoides), and pSH71 (Lactococcus lactis). We used an initiation-termination reaction, in which pE194 initiates replication at its own origin and is induced to terminate at the related pMV158 sequence, to demonstrate that pE194 replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism; the initiation nick site was localized to an 8-base-pair sequence.
TI  - Isolation of a replication region of a large lactococcal plasmid and use in cloning of a nisin resistance determinant.
AB  - The replication region of a 28-kilobase-pair (kbp) cryptic plasmid from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis SSD207 was cloned in L. lactis subsp. lactis MG1614 by using the chloramphenicol resistance gene from the streptococcal plasmid pGB301 as a selectable marker. The resulting 8.1-kbp plasmid, designated pVS34, was characterized further with respect to host range, potential cloning sites, and location of replication gene(s). In addition to lactococci, pVS34 transformed Lactobacillus plantarum and, at a very low frequency, Staphylococcus aureus but not Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis. The 4.1-kbp ClaI fragment representing lactococcal DNA in pVS34 contained unique restriction sites for HindIII, EcoRI, XhoII, and HpaII, of which the last three could be used for molecular cloning. A region necessary for replication was located within a 2.5-kbp fragment flanked by the EcoRI and ClaI restriction sites. A 3.8-kbp EcoRI fragment derived from a nisin resistance plasmid, pSF01, was cloned into the EcoRI site of pVS34 to obtain a nisin-chloramphenicol double-resistance plasmid, pVS39. From this plasmid, the streptococcal chloramphenicol resistance region was subsequently eliminated. The resulting plasmid, pVS40, contains only lactococcal DNA. Potential uses for this type of a nisin resistance plasmid are discussed.
TI  - Conjugal mobilization of streptococcal plasmid pMV158 between strains of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  - pMV158, a non-self-transmissible plasmid encoding tetracycline resistance, was conjugally transferred from Enterococcus faecalis JH203 to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403. This transfer appeared to be dependent on the cotransfer of the conjugative plasmids pAM beta 1 or pIP501. Intraspecies conjugal transfer of pMV158 also occurred in strain IL1403. In contrast to the transfer from E. faecalis, transfer in IL1403 did not require the presence of a conjugative plasmid in the donor strain but, rather, appeared to be dependent on putative chromosomal functions in strain IL1403. The transfer of pMV158 from strain IL1403 required the presence of an active pMV158-encoded protein, which showed homology to the Pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded by several small plasmids extracted from Staphylococcus aureus, such as pT181.
TI  - Bacterial growth in mastitic whey in relation to bacterial association with mastitis.
AB  - The growth of mastitis pathogens (eight strains) and non-pathogenic bacteria (eight strains) was studied using microturbidometry. All bacteria grew well in whey originating from uninflamed quarters. However, the growth of bacteria which are not considered to be mastitis pathogens (Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lactis and Pseudomonas fluorescens) became suppressed by whey from mastitic quarters. On the contrary, the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was generally better in mastitic samples. Streptococcus agalactiae showed inconsistent results.
TI  - Structure and expression of the Lactococcus lactis gene for phospho-beta-galactosidase (lacG) in Escherichia coli and L. lactis.
AB  - The Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 712 lacG gene encoding phospho-beta-galactosidase was isolated from the lactose mini-plasmid pMG820 and cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and L. lactis. The low phospho-beta-galactosidase activity in L. lactis transformed with high-copy-number plasmids containing the lacG gene contrasted with the high activity found in L. lactis containing the original, low-copy-number lactose plasmid pMG820, and indicated that the original lactose promoter was absent from the cloned DNA. In E. coli the phospho-beta-galactosidase could be overproduced using the strong inducible lambda PL promoter, which allowed a rapid purification of the active enzyme. The complete nucleotide sequence of the L. lactis lacG gene and its surrounding regions was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed by comparison with the amino acid composition of the purified phospho-beta-galactosidase and its amino-terminal sequence. This also allowed the exact positioning of the lacG gene and identification of its characteristic Gram-positive translation initiation signals. The homologous expression data and the sequence organization of the L. lactis lacG gene indicate that the gene is organized into a large lactose operon which contains an intergenic promoter located in an inverted repeat immediately preceding the lacG gene. The organization and sequence of the L. lactis lacG gene were compared with those of the highly homologous lacG gene from Staphylococcus aureus. A remarkable bias for leucine codons was observed in the lacG genes of these two species. Heterogramic homology was observed between the deduced amino acid sequence of the L. lactis phospho-beta-galactosidase, that of the functionally analogous E. coli phospho-beta-glucosidase, and that of an Agrobacterium beta-glucosidase (cellobiase).
TI  - Insertion and amplification of foreign genes in the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis chromosome.
AB  - The plasmid pE194 is unable to replicate in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (formerly Streptococcus lactis). When linked to resident bacteriophage sequences, pE194 was able to integrate into the L. lactis subsp. lactis chromosome either by Campbell-like recombination or by double crossing over with deletion. Integration occurred into the DNA of the prophage and prevented its multiplication. When a selective pressure was applied to an integrant in which pE194 was flanked by two direct repeats of prophage fragment, amplification of pE194 and the prophage fragment was observed. The pE194 copy number was assessed at six to nine, and amplification was stable upon growth under nonselective conditions.
TI  - Dry rehydratable films for enumeration of coliforms and aerobic bacteria in dairy products: collaborative study.
AB  - A collaborative study was conducted to compare proposed dry-film plating methods, using aerobic count plates and coliform count plates, to standard agar plating methods for quantifying aerobic bacteria and coliforms in dairy products. In this study, 5 food products (chocolate milk, pasteurized cheese, nonfat dry milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla ice cream), selected as representative dairy products, were analyzed by 11 collaborating laboratories. The results indicate that the dry-film plating methods are equivalent to or better than the agar plating methods. The aerobic count and coliform count dry-film plating methods have been adopted official first action.
TI  - IS257 from Staphylococcus aureus: member of an insertion sequence superfamily prevalent among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The nucleotide sequences for the IS257 family of insertion sequences from Staphylococcus aureus were compared with those of the ISS1 family from Streptococcus lactis and the IS15 family which is widespread amongst Gram-negative bacteria. These elements have a striking degree of similarity in both their putative transposase polypeptide sequences and their nucleotide sequences (40 to 64% between pairs), including 12 out of 14 bp conservation in their terminal inverted repeats. The evolutionary distance between the IS15 family and the IS257 and ISS1 families of Gram-positive origin is approximately twice that between the IS257 and ISS1 families. Analysis of base substitutions in the three sequences has provided insights into the effect of selection for the G + C content of immigrant genes to conform to that of their hosts, and into the evolution of biases in overall amino acid composition of cellular proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The IS257, ISS1, IS15 families form a superfamily of insertion sequences that has been involved in the spread of a number of antimicrobial resistance determinants in Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Influence of lactic starter inoculation, curd heating and ripening temperature on Staphylococcus aureus behaviour in Manchego cheese.
AB  - Growth and survival of Staphylococcus aureus were investigated in 52 lots of raw  ewe's milk Manchego cheese manufactured and ripened under different conditions. A 5.8-fold reduction in S. aureus counts after 60 days of ripening was obtained by inoculating milk with 1% Streptococcus lactis culture, and a further 2.0-fold reduction could be achieved by adding 0.1% Lactobacillus plantarum culture. Curd heating temperature had a significant effect on S. aureus survival, with counts 4-5 times lower in cheese from 30 degrees C curd than in cheese from curd heated at 36-40 degrees C. Ripening temperature was the parameter with the greatest influence on S. aureus counts, which reached in cheese cured at 10 degrees C or 20 degrees C for 60 days levels 10 and 100 times lower, respectively, than in cheese held at 5 degrees C.
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. Isolation  of active site peptides by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and determination of their primary structure.
AB  - Using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) it was possible to isolate 32P-labelled active-site regions of various proteins from the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. The purified peptides obtained by proteolytic cleavage with Lys-C protease and trypsin were sequenced by the gas phase method. The fragments derived from enzyme I (MW 70 000) of two streptococcal species show 100% homology. The analogous peptide of Staphylococcus aureus Enzyme I differs in the N-terminal region. A labelled peptide from the glucose-specific enzyme III protein of Escherichia coli obtained by cleavage with alkaline protease was isolated and sequenced. It could be fitted into the primary structure of this protein, which was derived from DNA sequence data. The active-site histidine residue of this protein is therefore localized at position 91. The HPLC separation method described is suitable for the isolation of peptides derived from active sites containing labile amino acid derivatives such as phosphohistidines.
TI  - Bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system: P-Ser-HPr and  its possible regulatory function?
AB  - HPr of the bacterial phosphotransferase system is a histidine-containing phospho-carrier protein. It is phosphorylated at a single histidyl residue with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and enzyme I and transfers the histidyl-bound phosphoryl group to a variety of factor III proteins. Recently, we described an HPr phosphorylated at a seryl residue (P-Ser-HPr), which is formed in an adenosine 5'-triphosphate dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase [Deutscher, J., & Saier, M.-H., Jr. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 6790-6794]. Now we demonstrate that this P-Ser-HPr is an altered substrate of phosphorylated enzyme I and factor III proteins compared to unphosphorylated HPr. Thus, P-Ser-HPr of Streptococcus lactis is phosphorylated about 5000 times slower by PEP and enzyme I than HPr. The slow phosphorylation by PEP and enzyme I can be overcome when factor III protein specific for gluconate (factor III(Gct)) of Streptococcus faecalis is added. Most likely, a complex of P-Ser-HPr and factor III(Gct) is formed which then becomes phosphorylated as fast as free HPr. Factor III protein specific for lactose (factor III(Lac)) of Staphylococcus aureus also enhances the phosphorylation of P-Ser-HPr by enzyme I and PEP, but its effect is lower. Thus, P-Ser-HPr is phosphorylated 70-100-fold slower in the presence of factor III(Lac) than in the presence of factor III(Gct). The described interaction of P-Ser-HPr with enzyme I in the presence of different factor III proteins could account for the regulation of sugar uptake within the phosphotransferase system. Some of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system sugars like glucose are known to be taken up in preference to others, for example, lactose.
TI  - HPr proteins of different microorganisms studied by hydrogen-1 high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance: similarities of structures and mechanisms.
AB  - The HPr proteins of Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli were studied by 1H NMR at 360 MHz. The "active-center" histidines of all HPr proteins are characterized by a low pK value between 5.6 and 6.1 and similar spectral parameters. Phosphorylation of the histidyl residues leads to an increase of the pK value of 2-3 units and spectral changes characteristic for N-1 phosphorylation of the histidyl ring. The spectra of the HPr proteins of S. lactis, S. Faecalis, B. subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus reveal many similarities, whereas the spectrum of the E. coli protein is different with exception of the active-center histidine. The HPr protein of S. lactis is formylated at its terminal amino group.
TI  - Proton motive force in growing Streptococcus lactis and Staphylococcus aureus cells under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
AB  - Measurements of the electrochemical gradient of hydrogen ions, which gives rise to the proton motive force (PMF), were carried out with growing Streptococcus lactis and Staphylococcus aureus cells. The facultative anaerobe was chosen in order to compare the PMF of cells growing aerobically and anaerobically. It was expected that during aerobic growth the cells would have a higher PMF than during anaerobic growth, because the H+-translocating ATPase (BF0F1) operates in the direction of H+ influx and ATP synthesis during respiration, whereas under anaerobic conditions the BF0F1 hydrolyzes glycolytically generated ATP and establishes the proton gradient by extruding H+. The electrical component of the PMF, delta psi, and the chemical gradient of H+, delta pH, were measured with radiolabeled tetraphenylphosphonium and benzoate ions. In both S. lactis and S. aureus cells, the PMF was constant during the exponential phase of batch growth and decreased in the stationary phase. In both species of bacteria, the exponential-phase PMF was not affected by varying the growth rate by adding different sugars to the medium. The relative contributions of delta psi and delta pH to the PMF, however, depended on the pH of the medium. The internal pH of S. aureus was constant at pH 7.4 to 7.6 under all conditions of growth tested. Under aerobic conditions, the delta psi of exponential phase S. aureus remained fairly constant at 160 to 170 mV. Thus, the PMF was 250 to 270 mV in cells growing aerobically in media at pH 6 and progressively lower in media of higher pH, reaching 195 to 205 mV at pH 7. Under anaerobic conditions, the delta psi ranged from 100 to 120 mV in cells at pH 6.3 to 7, resulting in a PMF of 150 to 140 mV. Thus, the mode of energy metabolism (i.e., respiration versus fermentation) and the pH of the medium are the two important factors influencing the PMF of these gram-positive cells during growth.
TI  - Selective adsorption of heterophile polyglycerophosphate antigen from antigen extracts of Streptococcus mutans and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Hot saline extracts of Streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. Chromatography of the extract of S. mutans strain MT703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 column gave two principal antigens. One antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. The other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. It was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (PGP) from group A Streptococcus pyogenes and/or S. mutans strain Ingbritt (type c). The PGP antigen was further purified by gel filtration with Sephadex G-75. Two peaks, PGP-1, and PGP-2, were obtained. Each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-PGP serum as shown by immunodiffusion. Chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. PGP antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. However, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of PGP. The PGP in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity. The addition of diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting PGP antigen. After adsorption of the extract from S. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and PGP antigens were absorbed with the resin. This simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the PGP-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.
TI  - Selective advantages of various bacterial carbohydrate transport mechanisms.
AB  - At least four strategies have been developed by bacteria for capturing carbohydrates. They are typified by the transport mechanisms for glycerol, glucose, lactose, and galactose in Escherichia coli. Glycerol enters the cell by facilitated diffusion catalyzed by specific membrane protein. Once inside the cell, the substrate is trapped by phosphorylation mediated by an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent kinase. glucose is phosphorylated in transit by a membrane-associated phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS). A specific component of this complex serves also for signal recognition to chemotaxis. Lactose is concentrated chemically unaltered by beta-galactoside permease driven by a proton motive force. Galactose is also pumped into the cell, but the process is energized by ATP or its equivalent. In addition, there is a periplasmic galactose-binding protein essential for both transport and chemotactic response. The relative functional merits of each kind of transport mechanism are discussed. Although many bacterial species possess both the concentrative mechanism and the PTS, some employ the former and others the latter for beta-galactoside utilization. The postulate that the PTS is more avid in scavenging while the concentrative permease system permits a broader range of substrate exploitation is supported by the growth responses of 12 bacterial strains to several beta-galactosides.
TI  - [Inspection of the bovine udder (author's transl)].
AB  - Cell counts were made once and the presence or absence of Str. agalactiae, Str. uberis, Str. dysgalactiae and St. aureus were determined once in all quarter samples on seventeen normal dairy farms. Of 1,416 quarters studied, 347 (24.5%) showed a cell count of greater than 500,000/ml. and, of 354 udders examined, 202 (57.1%) showed a cell count of greater than 500,000/ml. The total number of quarters infected with pathogenic agents was 287 (20.3%), the number of infected udders being 159 (48.3%). The findings reported by the present author should also be taken into account in the recent discussion of the question whether the udders of lactating cattle intended for slaughter should be systematically condemned or, at any rate, should only be designed for human consumption after having been passed.

TI  - Herd incidence of bovine mastitis in four Danish dairy. districts II. Evaluation  of the effect of the mastitis control scheme.
AB  - Bacteriological and cytological examinations have been carried out on samples from 6,808 cows belonging to 339 herds in four Danish dairy districts. After a discussion of differences between the districts as regards intensivity of mastitis control, public health surveillance, etc., definitions are given of certain terms, such as presence of bacteria, infection, pathogenic versus non-pathogenic (less pathogenic) organisms. The rate of infection with pathogenic organisms varies between districts from 23% to32% on a cow basis, and from 8% to 12% on a quarter basis. A comparison, on a cow basis, of the occurrence of pathogens as recorded in 1955/58 in three Danish surveys comprising 11 dairy districts, with the occurrence as recorded in four districts in 1972, showed a decline in incidence of between 7 and 9 percentage units. Together with the decline in incidence a definite change in the composition of the udder flora has taken place during that period. In particular, there was a pronounced fall in the occurrence of Group B, C, G, and L streptococci, and a relative increase in the occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus. A comparison, on a quarter basis, with the occurrence of pathogens in 30 English herds subjected through three years to intensive mastitis control, including systematic treatment of dry cows, teat dipping, and weekly inspection, showed that by such a programme a slightly lower level of infection was reached than in the 399 Danish herds which had been subjected to collective control for 10-15 years. The annual financial loss per cow suffering from mastitis being estimated at D.kr. 600.-, the reduction noted in the occurrence of bacteria in cows' udders implies an annual national saving of D.kr. 42 million on account of the Danish mastitis control. The total annual expenditure on Danish mastitis control is estimated at D.kr. 9million expenses would rise to some 70 million D.kr. if all registered cows were to be treated on drying-off, and if general teat dipping was to be carried out.
TI  - Antagonism of lactic streptococci toward Staphylococcus aureus in associative milk cutures.
AB  - The inhibition of growth of Staphylococcus aureus by lactic streptococci in associative cultures in milk was not due to hydrogen peroxide produced by the streptococci. Dialyzed whey from the milk culture of lactic streptococci was more inhibitory than dialyzed whey from milk acidified with lactic acid, indicating that material other than lactate was also involved. Analyses of cation and anion exchange fractions from the dialyzed whey showed that only the neutral fraction was inhibitory.
TI  - Effect of butterfat on inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus by nisin.
AB  
TI  - Effect of selected lactic acid bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus and production of enterotoxin.
AB  - Representative strains of 15 species of lactic acid bacteria were examined for their ability to influence growth of Staphylococcus aureus and production of enterotoxin in associative culture. Among the organisms used as effectors the streptococci were most inhibitory, followed by Pediococcus cerevisiae. The lactobacilli and Leuconostoc citrovorum were not inhibitory to growth and only slightly inhibitory to production of enterotoxin. Enterotoxin was detected in all cultures in which the population of S. aureus reached 8 x 10(7) per ml. At lower S. aureus populations no enterotoxin was detected after incubation for 48 h. Mechanisms of inhibition of growth and enterotoxin production by S. aureus strain 243 grown in association with Streptococcus lactis A64 or P. cerevisiae 10791 in APT broth were investigated. Competition for vital nutrients, especially niacin and biotin, and probably production of hydrogen peroxide contribute to inhibition. Production of lactic acid appears to inhibit growth of S. aureus in the early but not the late stages of incubation.
TI  - Effect of variations in conditions of incubation upon inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus by Pediococcus cerevisiae and Streptococcus lactis.
AB  - The effects of pH, temperature, proportion of Staphylococcus aureus in the inoculum, various strains of effector organism, and various strains of S. aureus were examined for their influence on interactions between staphylococci and effector organisms in associative culture. In general, small changes in pH had little effect upon either growth of S. aureus or production of enterotoxin in associative culture. Inhibition of growth of S. aureus caused by effector organisms was much greater at 25 than at 30 C. Proportion of S. aureus in the inoculum greatly affected both growth of the staphylococci and production of enterotoxin. Only slight differences were found between strains of either effector organism or S. aureus which affected the interactions in associative culture.
TI  - Effect of secondary metabolites on the organisms producing them: effect of nisin  on Streptococcus lactis and enterotoxin B on Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The effect of secondary metabolites added to cultures of the organisms producing  them was investigated. Nisin was added to growing cultures of a nisin-producing strain of Streptococcus lactis (354/07) and enterotoxin B to strains of Staphylococcus aureus (S6 and 243) producing enterotoxin B. One quarter (12 mug/ml) of the amount of nisin formed by the culture of S. lactis inhibited lag-phase cells and lysed log-phase cells. The same amount of nisin added before inoculation or at a time when nisin synthesis had started (in late log phase), caused only transient delay in growth. Inhibition of growth of the two enterotoxin B-producing strains of S. aureus could not be demonstrated at any stage of their growth cycle with as much as 1 mg of enterotoxin B per ml of medium.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of natural phenols and related compounds: obtusastyrene  and dihydro-obtusastyrene.
AB  - Factors influencing the antimicrobial properties of obtusastyrene and dihydro-obtusastyrene were studied. Both of these compounds were soluble in acetone, alcohol, and olive oil. In water, they were soluble at concentrations of 34 and 53 mug/ml, respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentrations against gram-positive bacteria and yeast were below 100 mug/ml. The compounds were not effective against gram-negative bacteria at 200 mug/ml or lower concentrations. With initial populations of cells greater than 10(6)/ml, the concentrations of these compounds required to prevent growth were greater than with lower cell populations. Changing the pH of the growth medium did not decrease the effectiveness of these two compounds in the pH range of 3 through 8. Both obtusastyrene and dihydro-obtusastyrene were rapidly bactericidal to Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus at 25 mug/ml.
