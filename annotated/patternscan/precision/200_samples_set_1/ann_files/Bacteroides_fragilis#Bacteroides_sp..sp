TI  == gastrointestinal symptoms in travellers.
AB  == diarrhoea is probably the single most common medical complaint in returning travellers. the most common pathogens are entero-toxigenic escherichia coli, shigella, salmonella and campylobacter. viruses, toxigenic arcobacter and bacteroides fragilis, as well as parasites such as cryptosporidium sp, are increasingly recognised but are not tested for in most diagnostic laboratories. blood in stools is a sign of invasive disease and should trigger exclusion of invasive amoebic disease. the use of empiric antibiotics may shorten illness but  is complicated by the diversity of bacterial causes and emerging resistance.

TI  == the beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  == background: the structure of exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a  few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. results: the strain named bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03  with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (eps) yield was selected to study the effect of its eps on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. the results indicated that eps significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis indicated that the eps significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. when receiving a low dose of eps, bacteroidales sp./lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and l. johnsonii, l. animalis and l. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a  high concentration of eps. conclusion: the combination of viable cell count, dgge and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity  in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of eps from b. bifidum wbin03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health  of their hosts.

TI  == [traveller's diarrhea: epidemiology, clinical practice guideline for the prevention and treatment].
AB  == bacterial causes are predominant: enterotoxigenic (etec) ou enteroadherent escherichia coli, salmonella sp., shigella sp., campylobacter jejuni, acrobacter  sp., enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis. prevention relies on the hand and food hygiene standards (heat-cooked meals). watery diarrhea (toxigenic enterocolitis)  is the most frequent clinical presentation associated with a risk of dehydration; the body temperature is normal except in cases of severe dehydration. less frequent are invasive enterocolitis presenting as acute febrile diarrhea with dysentery (abdominal cramps, tenesmus, stools blended with mucus and blood): salmonellosis, shigellosis. bacteremia may occur in immunocompromised patients. early rehydration is essential with oral rehydration solutions (ors) consisting of salt, sugar and water. antibiotics should be reserved for invasive enterocolitis with fever and dysentery, profuse diarrhea with more than three liquid stools within 12 hours. duration of antibiotherapy varies from 1 to 5 days.

TI  == [assessment of susceptibility of strictly anaerobic bacteria originated from different sources to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  == introduction: during the past 20 years, several studies at a national level in different countries followed resistance trends for bacteroides sp. and clostridium difficile. this study analysed antimicrobial susceptibility 73 anaerobic bacteria strains of bacteroides fragilis group (bfg) and c. difficile to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs. methods: the strictly anaerobes strains isolated in different hospitals were sent to the department of  medical microbiology, medical uniwersity of warsaw, where species determination was carried out with the api20 ana (biomerieux sa, marcy-l'etoile, france) system. susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using e-test. results: the rates of high resistance to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin of bfg was respectively 84% and 31% and among of c. difficile strains respectively 92% and 36%). the percentage of bfg strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin were respectively 84% and 46%. the percentage of c. difficile strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin was 52%. reduced level of susceptibility of bfg strains to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (8%) was confirmed. resistance to cefoxitin was 16% of bfg strains. all tested strains as well as bfg and c. difficile were susceptible to metronidazole. was observed reduced leve (eucast) of susceptibility of c. difficile strains to vancomycin (13%). conclusions. increasing resistance to various antimicrobial agents is a significant problem in poland. this demonstrate the need to continue with antibiotic resistance testing  and surveys in anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == differential interleukin-10 (il-10) and il-23 production by human blood monocytes and dendritic cells in response to commensal enteric bacteria.
AB  == human peripheral blood contains antigen-presenting cells (apc), including dendritic cells (dc) and monocytes, that may encounter microbes that have translocated from the intestine to the periphery in disease states like hiv-1 infection and inflammatory bowel disease. we investigated the response of dc and  monocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to a panel of representative commensal enteric bacteria, including escherichia coli, enterococcus sp., and bacteroides fragilis. all three bacteria induced significant upregulation of the maturation and activation markers cd40 and cd83 on myeloid dendritic cells (mdc) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc). however, only mdc produced cytokines, including interleukin-10 (il-10), il-12p40/70, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), in response to bacterial stimulation. cytokine profiles in whole pbmc differed depending on the stimulating bacterial species: b. fragilis induced production of il-23, il-12p70, and il-10, whereas e. coli and enterococcus induced an il-10-predominant response. mdc and monocyte depletion experiments indicated that these cell types differentially produced il-10 and il-23 in response to e. coli and b. fragilis. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron did not induce levels of il-23 similar to those of b. fragilis,  suggesting that b. fragilis may have unique proinflammatory properties among bacteroides species. the addition of recombinant human il-10 to pbmc cultures stimulated with commensal bacteria abrogated the il-23 response, whereas blocking il-10 significantly enhanced il-23 production, suggesting that il-10 controls the levels of il-23 produced. these results indicate that blood mdc and monocytes respond differentially to innate stimulation with whole commensal bacteria and that il-10 may play a role in controlling the proinflammatory response to translocated microbes.

TI  == comparative (meta)genomic analysis and ecological profiling of human gut-specific bacteriophage phib124-14.
AB  == bacteriophage associated with the human gut microbiome are likely to have an important impact on community structure and function, and provide a wealth of biotechnological opportunities. despite this, knowledge of the ecology and composition of bacteriophage in the gut bacterial community remains poor, with few well characterized gut-associated phage genomes currently available. here we  describe the identification and in-depth (meta)genomic, proteomic, and ecological analysis of a human gut-specific bacteriophage (designated phib124-14). in doing  so we illuminate a fraction of the biological dark matter extant in this ecosystem and its surrounding eco-genomic landscape, identifying a novel and uncharted bacteriophage gene-space in this community. phib124-14 infects only a subset of closely related gut-associated bacteroides fragilis strains, and the circular genome encodes functions previously found to be rare in viral genomes and human gut viral metagenome sequences, including those which potentially confer advantages upon phage and/or host bacteria. comparative genomic analyses revealed phib124-14 is most closely related to phib40-8, the only other publically available bacteroides sp. phage genome, whilst comparative metagenomic analysis of both phage failed to identify any homologous sequences in 136 non-human gut metagenomic datasets searched, supporting the human gut-specific nature of this phage. moreover, a potential geographic variation in the carriage  of these and related phage was revealed by analysis of their distribution and prevalence within 151 human gut microbiomes and viromes from europe, america and  japan. finally, ecological profiling of phib124-14 and phib40-8, using both gene-centric alignment-driven phylogenetic analyses, as well as alignment-free gene-independent approaches was undertaken. this not only verified the human gut-specific nature of both phage, but also indicated that these phage populate a distinct and unexplored ecological landscape within the human gut microbiome.

TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.

TI  == evaluation of antimicrobial activity of extracts of tibouchina candolleana (melastomataceae), isolated compounds and semi-synthetic derivatives against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == this work describes the phytochemical study of the extracts from aerial parts of  tibouchina candolleana as well as the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of extracts, isolated compounds, and semi-synthetic derivatives of ursolic acid against endodontic bacteria. hrgc analysis of the n-hexane extract of t. candolleana allowed identification of beta-amyrin, alpha-amyrin, and beta-sitosterol as major constituents. the triterpenes ursolic acid and oleanolic acid were isolated from the methylene chloride extract and identified. in addition, the flavonoids luteolin and genistein were isolated from the ethanol extract and identified. the antimicrobial activity was investigated via determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) using the broth microdilution method. amongst the isolated compounds, ursolic acid was the most effective against the selected endodontic bacteria. as for the semi-synthetic ursolic acid derivatives, only the methyl ester derivative potentiated the activity against bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == properties of boage2, a second n-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase from bacteroides ovatus atcc 8483.
AB  == n-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase (age) catalyzes the reversible epimerization between n-acetyl-d-mannosamine (mannac) and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac). bacteroides ovatus atcc 8483 shows 3 putative genes for age activity (bacova_00274, bacova_01795 and bacova_01816). the bacova_00274 gene encodes an age (boage1) with strong similarity to the age previously characterized in bacteroides fragilis. interestingly, the bacova_01816 gene (boage2) shares 57% identity with anabaena sp. ch1 age, but has an extra 27-amino acid tag sequence in the n-terminal. when cloned and expressed in escherichia coli rosetta (de3)plys, bacova_01816 was able to convert mannac into glcnac and vice versa. it was stable over a broad range of phs and its activity was enhanced by atp (20 mum). the incubation with atp stabilized its structure, raising its melting temperature by about 8 degrees c. in addition, the catalytic efficiency for mannac synthesis was higher than that for glcnac synthesis. these characteristics make boage2 a promising biocatalyst for sialic acid production using cheap glcnac as starting material. boage2 could be considered a renin-binding protein and its  interaction with renin was studied for the first time in a prokaryotic age. surprisingly, renin activated boage2, an effect which is contrary to that described for mammalian age and unrelated with the unique n-terminal tag, since a mutant without this tag was also activated by renin. when boage2 sequence was compared with other related (real and putative) age described in the databases, it was seen that age enzymes can be divided in 3 different groups. the relationship between these groups is also discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == quantitative detection of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis subtypes isolated  from children with and without diarrhea.
AB  == a rapid real-time pcr (rt-pcr) approach was developed to detect the bft gene subtypes in bacteroides fragilis isolated from fecal samples. dna obtained from diarrhea (110) and nondiarrhea (150) samples was evaluated. subtype 1 was observed in 9 (8.2%) diarrhea and 7 (4.7%) nondiarrhea samples. subtype 2 was not detected in any dna samples, and subtype 3 was observed in only 1 diarrhea sample. the presence of the bft-1 gene did not show any statistically significant differences between the groups of children. this technique could be used to evaluate a possible correlation between disease and the presence of b. fragilis enterotoxin.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == a family of transcriptional antitermination factors necessary for synthesis of the capsular polysaccharides of bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == a single strain of bacteroides fragilis synthesizes eight distinct capsular polysaccharides, designated psa to psh. these polysaccharides are synthesized by-products encoded by eight separate polysaccharide biosynthesis loci. the genetic architecture of each of these eight loci is similar, including the fact that the first gene of each locus is a paralog of the first gene of each of the other ps loci. these proteins are designated the upxy family, where x is replaced by a to h, depending upon the polysaccharide locus from which it is produced. mutational analysis of three separate upxy genes demonstrated that they are necessary and specific for transcription of their respective polysaccharide biosynthesis operon and that they function in trans. transcriptional reporter constructs, reverse transcriptase pcr, and deletion analysis demonstrated that the upxys do not affect initiation of transcription, but rather prevent premature transcriptional termination within the 5' untranslated region between the promoter and the upxy gene. the upxys have conserved motifs that are present in nusg and nusg-like proteins. mutation of two conserved residues within the conserved kow motif abrogated upay activity, further confirming that these proteins belong to the nusg-like (nusg(sp)) family. alignment of highly similar upxys led to the identification of a small region of these proteins predicted to  confer specificity for their respective loci. construction of an upay-upey hybrid that produced a protein in which a 17-amino-acid segment of upay was changed to that of upey altered upay's specificity, as it was now able to function in transcriptional antitermination of the pse biosynthesis operon.

TI  == species identification of clinical isolates of bacteroides by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and related species are important human pathogens involved in mixed infections of different origins. the b. fragilis group isolates are phenotypically very similar, grow more slowly than aerobic bacteria and, accordingly, are frequently misidentifed with classical or automated phenotypical identification methods. recent taxonomic changes and new species accepted as members of the bacteroides genus are not included in the different databases of commercially available identification kits. the use of matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) was therefore evaluated for the species identification of 277 clinical isolates of the bacteroides genus. species identification was carried out with maldi bruker daltonik biotyper software (bruker daltonik gmbh, bremen, germany) by comparing the mass spectrum of each strain with the mass spectra of the 3260 reference strains currently available. the results of conventional phenotypical identification of the isolates were used as a reference. 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed for a selection of the strains that gave discrepant results and for all those inconclusively identified by maldi-tof ms; 270 isolates (97.5%) were unequivocally identified [log(score) >/=2.0] by comparison with the reference strains present in the maldi biotyper database. of the 23 isolates for which the  maldi-tof ms species identification differed from the conventional phenotypical identification, 11 were sequenced. the sequencing data confirmed the maldi-tof ms result in ten cases and, for the remaining isolate, the sequencing data did not lead to the determination of the species, but only to that of the genus (bacteroides sp.). the discriminating power and identification accuracy of maldi-tof ms proved to be superior to that of biochemical testing for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides uniformis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of human defensins on anaerobic intestinal bacterial species: a major role of hbd-3.
AB  == defensins are natural mucosal antimicrobial peptides and their broad spectrum activity against aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria has been well investigated. the aim of this study was to systematically examine the antibacterial activity of the small intestinal paneth cell derived alpha-defensin hd5 and the major colonic beta-defensins hbd-1-3 against strict anaerobic intestinal bacteria. the antibacterial activity was assessed with a flow cytometric assay employing a membrane potential sensitive dye as marker for loss  of cell viability. the majority of the tested strains belonging to the dominant anaerobe genera of the gut, bacteroides and parabacteroides, were only minimally  affected by the constitutively expressed defensins hd5 and hbd-1. the inducible defensin hbd-2 had a limited antibacterial effect, whereas the inducible hbd-3 exhibited potent activity against most strains. the effect of hbd-3 on bacteroides sp. appeared to be dependent on the presence of oxygen. bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from blood during bacteremia or from extraintestinal infections were more resistant to hbd-3 than strains from the physiological gut flora. thus, defensin resistance is not only species- but also strain-specific and may be clinically relevant in the host-bacteria interaction influencing mucosal translocation and systemic infection.

TI  == multidrug resistance gene deficient (mdr1a-/-) mice have an altered caecal microbiota that precedes the onset of intestinal inflammation.
AB  == aim: to compare caecal microbiota from mdr1a(-/-) and wild type (fvb) mice to identify differences in the bacterial community that could influence the intestinal inflammation. methods and results: caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and fvb mice were evaluated at 12 and 25 weeks of age using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative real-time pcr. dgge fingerprints of fvb and mdr1a(-/-) mice (with no intestinal inflammation) at 12 weeks revealed differences in the presence of dna fragments identified as bacteroides fragilis,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus and an uncultured alphaproteobacterium. escherichia coli and acinetobacter sp. were only identified in dgge profiles of mdr1a(-/-) mice at 25 weeks (with severe intestinal inflammation), which also had a lower number of total bacteria in the caecum compared with fvb mice at same age. conclusions: differences found in the caecal microbiota of fvb and mdr1a(-/-) mice (12 weeks) suggest that the lack of abcb1 transporters in intestinal cells due to the disruption of the mdr1a gene might lead to changes in the caecal microbiota. the altered microbiota along with the genetic defect could contribute to the development of intestinal inflammation in mdr1a(-/-) mice. significance and impact of the study: differences in caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and fvb mice (12 weeks) suggest genotype specific colonization. the results provide evidence that abcb1 transporters may regulate host interactions with commensal bacteria. future work is needed to identify the mechanisms involved in this possible cross-talk between the host intestinal cells and microbiota.

TI  == characterization of bcta, a mating apparatus protein required for transfer of the bacteroides fragilis conjugal element btf-37.
AB  == we have previously described the identification of btf-37, an autonomously transferable chromosomal element isolated from bacteroides fragilis clinical isolate lv23. in this study, we determined that btf-37 harbors a 16kb conjugal transfer-encoding region that contains an almost identical copy of a previously identified bacteroides sp. conjugation-specific gene bcta. bcta has been shown to be required for conjugation in other bacteroides sp. strains, but no information  is available regarding its function. we now report strain distribution and gene expression profiles of bcta. the bcta gene was present in conjugative transposon-harboring b. fragilis strains, but not on a non-transferable b. fragilis plasmid. we also showed that recombinant bcta predominantly localized to the bacterial membrane, and that its n-terminal 32 amino acids were cleaved in an escherichia coli protein expression system, indicating the presence of a signal sequence. expression of bcta consistently increased ~3-fold upon pre-exposure of  conjugating b. fragilis lv23 to subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline. maximum expression occurred 60min post-tetracycline induction, which also coincided with the time at which highest conjugation frequencies were seen for strain lv23. based on localization, signal sequence and tetracycline inducibility, our results indicate that bcta is indeed an important member of the bacteroides conjugal apparatus, since its gene is regulated by conditions that specifically control conjugation.

TI  == antagonic effect of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide on the mortality of  mice acutely infected with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == sepsis, the leading cause of death in intensive care units, is associated with overproduction of nitric oxide (no) due to inducible no synthase (inos), responsible for some of the pathologic changes. aminoguanidine (ag) is a selective inos inhibitor with reported inconsistent actions in sepsis. to investigate the influence of inos, we studied models of acute bacterial sepsis using acute challenges with aerobic (escherichia coli) and anaerobic (bacteroides fragilis) bacteria in the presence of ag. six-week-old, 23 g, male and female balb/c and c57bl/6j mice, in equal proportions, were inoculated (ip) with bacteria in groups of 4 animals for each dose and each experiment in the absence  or presence of ag (50 mg/kg, ip, starting 24 h before challenge and daily until day 6) and serum nitrate was measured by chemiluminescence. both types of bacteria were lethal to mice, with an ld50 of 6 nephelometric units (u) for e. coli and 8 u for b. fragilis. nitrate production peaked on the second day after e. coli inoculation with 8 and 6 u (p < 0.05), but was absent after non-lethal lower doses. after challenge with b. fragilis this early peak occurred at all tested doses after 24 h, including non-lethal ones (p < 0.05). ag-treated mice challenged with e. coli presented higher survival (p < 0.05) and increased ld50.  ag-treated mice challenged with b. fragilis had lower ld50 and higher mortality.  control ag-treated animals presented no toxic effects. the opposite effect of inos blockade by ag in these models could be explained by restriction of oxygen for immune cells or an efficient action of no in anaerobic localized infections.  the antagonic role of no production observed in our bacterial models could explain the reported discrepancy of no action in sepsis.

TI  == bft gene subtyping in enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis isolated from children with acute diarrhea.
AB  == enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) strains are associated with diarrhea  disease in farm animals and young children. in this study, the bft gene subtyping from etbf strains recovered from one immunodeficient and two immunocompetent children with diarrhea were determined. thirteen etbf strains were isolated and by using a multiplex-pcr their bft subtypes were determined. all 13 etbf strains  harbored the bft-1 subtype and by ap-pcr they were clustered in the same group i. this study shows that etbf strains can be present in acute diarrhea and that bft-1 subtype is often present in these organisms. however, further studies are needed to evaluate the role of this bft-1 subtype in the pathogenesis of diarrhea.

TI  == plasmid-related resistance to cefoxitin in species of the bacteroides fragilis group isolated from intestinal tracts of calves.
AB  == species of the bacteroides fragilis group are considered the most common anaerobe in human and animal infections and also harbor plasmids conferring resistance to  several antibiotics. in this study, resistance to cefoxitin, plasmid profile and  beta-lactamase production in species of the b. fragilis group isolated from intestinal tracts of calves were evaluated. one hundred sixty-one b. fragilis group bacteria isolated from calves with and without diarrhea were analyzed. cefoxitin susceptibility was performed using an agar dilution method, beta-lactamase production by using a nitrocefin method, and plasmid extraction by using a commercial kit. minimal inhibitory concentration values for cefoxitin ranged from 32 to > 512 microg/ml, and 47 bacteria (29.2%) were resistant to cefoxitin (breakpoint 16 microl). only seven isolates harbored plasmids varying from 6.0 to 5.0 kb, and a 5.5-kb plasmid in b. vulgatus bd26e and b. fragilis bc5j might be related to cefoxitin resistance. beta-lactamase was detected in 33  (70.2%) isolates. the cepa gene was observed in total dna and in the 5.5-kb plasmid. the plasmid presence in organisms isolated from cattle may be important  in ecologic terms, and it needs further study.

AB  == at present little or no data is available regarding the resistance profiles of anaerobic bacteria in relation to the general usage of antibiotics. the objective of this study was to assess whether any potential relationship exists between the dynamics of antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria and the consumption of antibiotics during the last 3 years within the estonian population. in total, 416 anaerobic isolates were investigated from various clinical samples. the anaerobes were isolated on wilkins-chalgren agar, incubated in an anaerobic glove box and identified by standard methods. beta-lactamase negative strains were tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, benzylpenicillin and the positive strains were further tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam  by e-tests. the results of the susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the current criteria of nccls. data from the estonian state agency of medicines was used to assess the antibiotic consumption rate in the population (defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants annually). the following species of anaerobes were isolated: b. fragilis group, bacteroides sp., fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., peptostreptococcus sp., in addition to various unidentified gram-positive rods. metronidazole resistance was not found among gram-negative bacteria despite a relatively high consumption of this antimicrobial agent in estonia. only ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated excellent  in vitro activity against all anaerobes. unexpectedly despite a relatively low rate of consumption of clindamycin a high rate of resistance to this agent occurred; a similar situation was noted for penicillin. in the present study we did not observe a relationship between the changes in antibiotic consumption (ddd/1000) rate and the resistance pattern of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, clindamycin, penicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam during a 3-year follow-up period. high resistance to penicillin among some species and also to clindamycin is similar to the global trend and argues for limited use of these antibiotics in empirical treatment. we would suggest that monitoring of local susceptibility pattern is necessary for the selection of initial empirical therapy.

TI  == evaluation of the pathogenicity of the bacteroides fragilis toxin gene subtypes in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis (etbf) strains produce a metalloprotease toxin (bft) related to diarrheal disease in animals, young children, and adults.  three different isoforms of the enterotoxin, designated bft-1, bft-2, and bft-3,  have been identified and sequenced. in the present study, the pathogenicity of the etbf strains carrying bft-1 or bft-2 was evaluated. each toxin gene subtype of etbf (bft-1 or bft-2) was intragastrically monoassociated to germ-free mice during 10 days and histopathological data from intestines and liver compared with those from mice monoassociated to a non-enterotoxigenic b. fragilis. histopathological alterations were observed in all groups of animals related to etbf. these alterations were characterized mainly by ulceration, edema, and inflammatory infiltration in intestine. however, these lesions were slightly more severe in mice monoassociated with bft-2 subtype. no alteration or lesion was observed in animals associated with the non-enterotoxigenic b. fragilis. in conclusion, strains harboring bft-1 or bft-2 gene subtypes were able to induce histopathological alterations in intestine of a gnotobiotic mice model and it could explain the effect produced for the enterotoxin.

TI  == occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg). however, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to sdg conversion. therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of sdg metabolising bacteria. the data showed differences in conversion efficiency between sdg deglycosylating species, but sdg was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. the strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db showed the highest initial rate  of sdg deglycosylation. furthermore, we found that bacteroides distasonis and b.  fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. however, clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only  two out of 20 faecal samples. bacteria involved in the demethylation step of sdg  conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than sdg. in particular, peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. finally, eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.

TI  == effects of subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin on the morphological, biochemical and genetic characteristics of bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the effects of subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin on the morphological,  biochemical and genetic characteristics of species of the bacteroides fragilis group isolated from children with diarrhea were determined. the minimal inhibitory and subinhibitory concentrations for clindamycin were determined. minimal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 0.25 to 512 microg ml(-1) were observed. cultures grown with clindamycin were used to determine the macroscopic morphological characteristics, cellular viability, ultrastructural characteristics and dna integrity. clindamycin did not alter colonial morphology, but after 6 h elongated cells were observed. also, extracellular vesicles and electron-lucent areas inside the cytoplasm were observed. bacteria treated with clindamycin also showed fragmentation of dna as determined by electrophoresis. the alterations produced by clindamycin might be indicative of a possible modification of the structures involved in bacterial pathogenesis.

TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

TI  == "bacteroides nordii" sp. nov. and "bacteroides salyersae" sp. nov. isolated from  clinical specimens of human intestinal origin.
AB  == two groups of unknown bacteria, which phenotypically resemble members of the bacteroides fragilis group but phylogenetically display >5% 16s rrna gene sequence divergence from their nearest validly described species, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. phylogenetically and phenotypically, the unidentified bacteria displayed a relatively close association with each other. however, a 16s rrna gene sequence divergence of approximately 4% between the two unknown bacteria, as well as distinguishable biochemical characteristics, demonstrates that these organisms are genotypically and phenotypically distinct, and each group may represent a previously unknown subline within the bacteroides phylogenetic cluster. subsequent dna-dna hybridization studies confirmed that the two novel organisms were indeed distinct from each other. the previously described species closest to both of them is b. thetaiotaomicron (approximately 94% sequence similarity), but  they can be differentiated easily from b. thetaiotaomicron by virtue of not utilizing trehalose. dna-dna pairing studies also documented the separateness of  the unknown species and b. thetaiotaomicron. based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, two new species, "bacteroides nordii" sp. nov. and "bacteroides salyersae" sp. nov, are proposed. the g+c content of the dna is 41.4 mol% for bacteroides nordii and 42.0 mol% for bacteroides salyersae. the type strains of bacteroides nordii and bacteroides salyersae are wal 11050 (atcc baa-998 or ccug 48943) and wal 10018 (atcc baa-997 or ccug 48945), respectively.

TI  == survey of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the bacteria of the bacteroides fragilis group isolated from the intestinal tract of children.
AB  == the bacteria of the bacteroides fragilis group are considered important clinical  pathogens and they are the most common anaerobes isolated from human endogenous infections. in this study, the susceptibility patterns to antibiotics and metals  of 114 species of the b. fragilis group isolated from children with and without diarrhea were determined. susceptibility was assayed by using an agar dilution method with wilkins-chalgren agar. all b. fragilis strains were resistant to lead and nickel, but susceptible to metronidazole and imipenem. beta-lactamase production was detected by using biological and nitrocefin methods, respectively, in 50% and 90.6% of the isolates of children with diarrhea and in 60% and 90% of  the isolates of children without diarrhea. our results show an increase of antibiotics and metals resistance in this microbial group, and a periodic evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility is needed. in brazil, the contamination for antibiotics or metal ions is often observed, and it is suggested an increase the antimicrobial resistance surveillance of this microbial group, mainly those isolated from children's diarrhea.

AB  == anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. the types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include  para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. the anaerobes  recovered in these studies were gram-negative bacilli (including bacteroides fragilis and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp.), clostridium sp., anaerobic gram-positive cocci and actinomyces sp. in many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. the recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. these antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.

AB  == three novel insertion sequences (iss) (ispso1, ispso2, and ispso3) of the soil bacterium paracoccus solventivorans dsm 11592 were identified by transposition into entrapment vector pmec1. ispso1 (1,400 bp) carries one large open reading frame (orf) encoding a putative basic protein (with a dde motif conserved among transposases [tnps] of elements belonging to the is256 family) with the highest levels of similarity with the hypothetical tnps of rhodospirillum rubrum and sphingopyxis macrogoltabida. ispso2 (832 bp) appeared to be closely related to isppa2 of paracoccus pantotrophus dsm 11072 and is1248 of paracoccus denitrificans pdx22, both of which belong to the is427 group (is5 family). these  elements contain two overlapping orfs and a putative frameshift motif (aaaag) responsible for production of a putative transframe tnp. ispso3 (1,286 bp) contains a single orf, whose putative product showed homology with tnps of iss classified as members of a distinct subgroup of the is5 group of the is5 family.  the highest levels of similarity were observed with isssp126 of sphingomonas sp.  and is1169 of bacteroides fragilis. analysis of the distribution of iss of p. solventivorans revealed that ispso2-like elements are the most widely spread of the elements in nine species of the genus paracoccus: ispso1 and ispso3 are present in only a few paracoccal strains, which suggests that they were acquired  by lateral transfer. phylogenetic analysis of tnps of the novel iss and their closest relatives showed their evolutionary relationships and possible directions of lateral transfer between various bacterial hosts.

AB  == during studies on the bacteriology of appendicitis in children, we often isolated from inflamed and non-inflamed tissue samples, an unusual bile-resistant pigment-producing strictly anaerobic gram-negative rod. phenotypically this organism resembles members of bacteroides fragilis group of species, as it is resistant to bile and exhibits a special-potency-disk pattern (resistance to vancomycin, kanamycin and colistin) typical for the b. fragilis group. however, the production of brown pigment on media containing haemolysed blood and a cellular fatty acid composition dominated by iso-c15:0, suggests that the organism most closely resembles species of the genus porphyromonas. however, the  unidentified organism differs from porphyromonads by being bile-resistant and by  not producing butyrate as a metabolic end-product. comparative 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism represents a distinct sub-line, associated with but distinct from, the miss-classified species bacteroides putredinis. the clustering of the unidentified bacterium with bacteroides putredinis was statistically significant, but they displayed > 4% sequence divergence with each other. chromosomal dna-dna pairing studies further  confirmed the separateness of the unidentified bacterium and bacteroides putredinis. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that bacteroides putredinis and the unidentified bacterium from human sources be  classified in a new genus alistipes, as alistipes putredinis comb. nov. and alistipes finegoldii sp. nov., respectively. the type strain of alistipes finegoldii is ccug 46020(t) (= ahn243(t)).

(5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

AB  == cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus.  nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.

TI  == clinical review: bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp., clostridium sp., and fusobacterium sp. were the most common clinically significant anaerobic isolates. the strains of anaerobic organisms found depended, to a large extent, on the portal of entry and the underlying disease. predisposing conditions include: malignant neoplasms, immunodeficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, decubitus ulcers, perforation of viscus and appendicitis, and neonatal age. organisms identical to those causing anaerobic bacteremia can often be recovered from other infected sites that may have served as a source of persistent bacteremia. when anaerobes resistant to penicillin are suspected or isolated, antimicrobial drugs such as clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefoxitin, a carbapenem, or the combination of a  beta-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin should be administered. the early recognition of anaerobic bacteremia and administration of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy play a significant role in preventing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients.

(17.4%), prevotella sp. (15.1%) and porphyromonas sp. (11.2%). neomycin blood agar plate yielded the maximum number (72.8%) of strains in pure culture. gram negative anaerobic bacilli in infective processes are significantly on the rise and so suspected cultures should be processed for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

AB  == horizontal dna transfer contributes significantly to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteroides fragilis. to further our understanding of dna transfer in b. fragilis, we isolated and characterized a new transfer factor, clv25. clv25 was isolated from b. fragilis lv25 by its capture on the nonmobilizable escherichia coli-bacteroides shuttle vector pgat400deltabglii. similar to other bacteroides sp. transfer factors, clv25 was mobilized in e. coli by the conjugative plasmid r751. using tn1000 mutagenesis and deletion analysis of clv25, two mobilization genes, bmga and bmgb, were identified, whose predicted proteins have similarity to dna relaxases and mobilization proteins, respectively. in particular, bmga and bmgb were homologous to moca and mocb, respectively, the two mobilization proteins of the b. fragilis mobilizable transposon tn4399. a cis-acting origin of transfer (orit) was localized to a 353-bp region that included nearly all of the intergenic region between bmgb and  orf22 and overlapped with the 3' end of orf22. this orit contained a putative nic site sequence but showed no significant similarity to the orit regions of other transfer factors, including tn4399. despite the lack of sequence similarity between the orits of clv25 and tn4399, a mutation in the clv25 putative dna relaxase, bmga, was partially complemented by tn4399. in addition to the functional cross-reaction with tn4399, a second distinguishing feature of clv25 is that predicted proteins have similarity to proteins encoded not only by tn4399 but by several bacteroides sp. transfer factors, including nbu1, nbu2, ctndot, tn4555, and tn5520.

TI  == isolation and characterization of btf-37: chromosomal dna captured from bacteroides fragilis that confers self-transferability and expresses a pilus-like structure in bacteroides spp. and escherichia coli.
AB  == we report the isolation and preliminary characterization of btf-37, a new 52-kb transfer factor isolated from bacteroides fragilis clinical isolate lv23. btf-37  was obtained by the capture of new dna in the nonmobilizable bacteroides-escherichia coli shuttle vector pgat400deltabglii using a functional  assay. btf-37 is self-transferable within and from bacteroides and also self-transfers in e. coli. partial dna sequencing, colony hybridization, and pcr  revealed the presence of tet element-specific sequences in btf-37. in addition, tn5520, a small mobilizable transposon that we described previously (g. vedantam, t. j. novicki, and d. w. hecht, j. bacteriol. 181:2564-2571, 1999), was also coisolated within btf-37. scanning and transmission electron microscopy of tet element-containing bacteroides spp. and btf-37-harboring bacteroides and e. coli  strains revealed the presence of pilus-like cell surface structures. these structures were visualized in bacteroides spp. only when btf-37 and tet element strains were induced with subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline and resembled those encoded by e. coli broad-host-range plasmids. we conclude that we have captured a new, self-transferable transfer factor from b. fragilis lv23 and  that this new factor encodes a tetracycline-inducible bacteroides sp. conjugation apparatus.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria and intrahepatic stones: detections of clostridium sp. and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == objective: to detect anaerobic bacteria clostridium sp. and bacteroides fragilis  in intrahepatic stones by molecular genetic method. methods: dna was extracted from 59 stone samples and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification targeting the 16s rrna gene of clostridium sp. and the glutamine synthetase gene of bacteroides fragilis. single-strand conformational polymorphism (sscp) analysis was performed to identify the clostridium sp. results: 16s rrna gene sequences for clostridium sp. were identified in 49 stones (83%, 49/59). the two most common groups were detected in 19 (41%) and 17 (37%) of the 46 samples using sspc analysis, and 25/59 (42%) stones were tested positive for bacteroides fragilis. conclusions: anaerobes such as clostridium sp. and bacteroides fragilis present in intrahepatic stones and may play a role in stone formation. pcr is a useful technique to detect fastidious pathogens, which  are difficult to culture. sscp of pcr products is a rapid method in differentiating bacterial species.

TI  == substance p immunoreactive sensory axons as a subset of the total axonal population in the maxillary sinus of the rabbit: a characterization of normal and infected mucosa.
AB  == substance p (sp), one of the neuropeptides released from sensory nerves, is thought to mediate neurogenic inflammation. although sp immunoreactive axons have been described in the sinus mucosa, no attempt has been made to characterize sp fibers as a subset of all axons present in the sinus mucosa. in addition, no study to date has characterized the changes in infected sinus mucosa. the maxillary sinus mucosa of new zealand white rabbits was harvested from control animals and in animals with induced maxillary sinusitis. immunohistochemical staining of the sinus mucosa for both protein gene product 9.5 (pgp), a nonspecific marker for all nerves, and for sp was performed on 11 animals: 3 controls and 8 infected. in sinus mucosa from the control rabbits, <50% of all axons labeled by pgp were immunoreactive for sp. in infected mucosa, the absolute number of axons found by pgp staining decreased and nearly all of these remaining fibers were also immunoreactive for sp. we conclude that the phenotypical labeling of nerve fibers seen in normal mucosa is altered by bacterial-induced infection.

TI  == bacteroides acidifaciens sp. nov., isolated from the caecum of mice.
AB  == during studies of the bacterial flora in the intestines of mice, we isolated characteristic strains which lowered the ph of peptone-yeast broth containing fildes' digest. based on 16s rrna sequence comparison, these isolates were considered to belong to the bacteroides cluster in the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum, and were divided into two groups. their phenotypic characteristics, i.e. growth in 20% bile, aesculin hydrolysis, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pdh) and 6-phosphogluconate  dehydrogenase (6pgdh) activity, were the same as those of the 'bacteroides fragilis group'. the low level of dna-dna hybridization with type strains in the  bacteroides cluster confirmed the novel species status of these isolates. it is proposed that these isolates be named bacteroides acidifaciens, the type strain of which is a40t (= jcm 10556t).

TI  == [trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

AB  == a catalase gene from rhizobium sp. snu003, a root nodule symbiont of canavalia lineata, was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. the rhizobium dna of about 280 bp was amplified using two pcr primers synthesized from the conserved sequences of the type i catalase gene. the nucleotide sequence of the amplified fragment revealed three regions that were conserved in the catalase, showing it as being part of the catalase gene. a genomic southern hybridization using this fragment as a probe showed that the 5.5 kb psti, 1.8 kb ecori, and 0.7 kb styi fragments hybridized strongly with the probe. the rhizobium genomic library constructed into the embl3 vector was screened, and one catalase clone was selected. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.5 kb psti fragment from the clone  revealed an open reading frame of 1455 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 485 amino acids with a molecular mass of 54,958 da and a pi of 6.54. the predicted amino acid sequence of the catalase is 66.3% identical to that of bacteroides fragilis, but was only 53.3% identical to the rhizobium meliloti catalase.

TI  == the effect of vaginal microbes on in vivo and in vitro expression of human papillomavirus 16 e6-e7 genes.
AB  == since other viruses can influence expression of human papillomavirus (hpv) 16 e6-e7 genes in vitro, this study addressed whether specific vaginal bacteria do so as well. the vaginal microflora of 18 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) or normal histology and hpv 16 infection, was evaluated by quantitative culture. expression of hpv 16 e6-e7 oncogenes was assessed in exfoliated cervical cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. hpv 16 expression was also quantitated in caski carcinoma cell line cocultured with bacteroides fragilis or lactobacillus acidophilus. isolation of lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.05) and expression of the e6*ii transcript (p = 0.03) were associated with low-grade cin or normal histology. however, changes in e6-e7 expression were not  associated independently with isolation of a specific microorganism. similarly, expression of hpv 16 e6-e7 oncogenes in vitro was unaltered in the presence of bacteria. these results suggest that vaginal microorganisms are unlikely to alter the natural history of hpv-associated cin by influencing hpv oncogene expression.

AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == cloning of an ef-p homologue from bacteroides fragilis that increases b. fragilis glutamine synthetase activity in escherichia coli.
AB  == investigations of possible regulators of bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (gs) activity were done in escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. the b. fragilis glna gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pacyc184 and expressed in the e. coli glna ntrb ntrc deletion strain, ymc11. gs activity was monitored following co-transformation with a b. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pecor251. a gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in b. fragilis gs activity but did not affect the activity of the e. coli gs enzyme or the b. fragilis sucrase (scrl). deletion of the b. fragilis glna downstream region decreased basal levels of gs activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the b. fragilis gs activity. reporter gene analysis, using the b. fragilis glna promoter region fused to the promoterless clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. this demonstrated that the increase in gs  activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. sequence data  indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor p (ef-p) proteins, the highest being to that of a synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to mycobacterium genitalium (27%). amino acid identity to the e. coli ef-p was intermediate (37%). a possible role for ef-p in enhancing translation of the b. fragilis glna mrna is proposed.

TI  == bacteriologic and therapeutic considerations in intra-abdominal surgical infections.
AB  == the most important factor in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections are early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention while antibiotics play a secondary role. the goals of surgical procedures should be to stop peritoneal contamination, to debride necrotic tissue, to remove debris and foreign bodies and to drain any pus collection. antibiotics should be initiated before surgery and they must encompass both colonic aerobes and anaerobes including bacteroides  fragilis group but not necessary enterococcus sp. antibacterial agents with pure  activity against anaerobes include chloramphenicol, clindamycin and the nitroimidazoles while ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin, cefotetan, ceftizoxime imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem and some advanced quinolones like sparfloxacin, represent a single drug to cover both aerobic and anaerobic microflora. although almost all clinical trials usually result in a 90% efficacy rate, the final outcome is dependant on the stage of the infection (early versus late), sepsis score, underlying diseases and the applied surgical procedures. on the other hand the choice of antibiotic(s) must be influenced by its toxicity, profiles local nosocomial susceptibility patterns, resistance inducing ability and price.

TI  == fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  == a total of 243 strains of fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. the strains included 65 (27%) fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) fusobacterium varium, three (1%) fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) fusobacterium gonidiaformans. most fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. these included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. the organisms most commonly isolated with fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. (95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.

TI  == a new type of glutamine synthetase in cyanobacteria: the protein encoded by the glnn gene supports nitrogen assimilation in synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803.
AB  == a new glutamine synthetase gene, glnn, which encodes a polypeptide of 724 amino acid residues (m(r), 79,416), has been identified in the unicellular cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803; this is the second gene that encodes a glutamine synthetase (gs) in this cyanobacterium. the functionality of  this gene was evidenced by its ability to complement an escherichia coli glna mutant and to support synechocystis growth in a strain whose glna gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis. in this mutant (strain sjcr3), as well as in the wild-type strain, the second gs activity was subject to regulation by the  nitrogen source, being strongly enhanced in nitrogen-free medium. transcriptional fusion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene with the 5'-upstream region of glnn suggested that synthesis of the second synechocystis gs is regulated at the transcriptional level. furthermore, the level of glnn mrna, a transcript of about 2,300 bases, was found to be strongly increased in nitrogen-free medium. the glnn product is similar to the gs subunits of bacteroides fragilis and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, two obligate anaerobic bacteria whose gss are markedly different from other prokaryotic and eukaryotic gss. however, significant similarity is evident in the five regions which are homologous in all of the gss so far described. the new gs gene was also found in  other cyanobacteria but not in n2-fixing filamentous species.

(276, including 190 b. fragilis group), prevotella sp. (159), fusobacterium sp. (122), escherichia coli (114), and staphylococcus aureus (97). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. these data illustrate the importance of ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == value of cultures of tissue samples taken at operation for lower intestinal perforation.
AB  == tissue cultures from perforations of the lower intestinal tract commonly yield both aerobes (coliform organisms) and anaerobes (bacteroides sp. and clostridium  sp.). to determine the consistency of this pattern and the value of intraoperative cultures, the authors reviewed the hospital records of 115 patients with perforation of the appendix (100 patients) or colon (15 patients),  treated between 1987 and 1990, in whom organisms were cultured from tissue samples taken intraoperatively. attention was paid to the organisms cultured, their distribution and antibiotic sensitivity in initial samples and in subsequent samples obtained when there were septic complications. on average, 4.7 bacterial isolates per patient were obtained. the common organisms were as expected: bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium sp. although the culture results did not affect the management of these patients, the sensitivity  of bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin was found to be lower than expected, indicating a shift in sensitivity.

TI  == oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes (three strains), escherichia coli (two strains), proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and a bacteroides sp. the phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. the three listeria strains were the most susceptible  to phagocytic uptake and the salmonella strain was relatively resistant. the intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. the strains with the best intracellular survival were ent. faecalis and two of the three listeria strains. the ability of s. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two e. coli strains. oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.

AB  == the bacteriologic and clinical findings of 39 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. twenty-three children presented with brain abscess and 16 with subdural empyema. predisposing conditions were present in all instances. sinusitis was present in 25 children and 4 patients each had chronic otitis media, dental abscess, and congenital heart disease. the abscess was located in the frontal area in 14 patients, parietal in 13, and temporal in 12. anaerobic organisms alone were recovered in 22 patients (56%), aerobic bacteria alone in 7 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 10 (26%) patients.  there were 79 anaerobic isolates (2 per specimen). the predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (29 isolates); bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 bacteroides fragilis group), fusobacterium sp. (14 isolates); and prevotella sp.  and actinomyces sp. (6 isolates each). a total of 17 aerobic or facultative isolates (0.4 per specimen), including 11 gram-positive cocci and 6 haemophilus sp., were recovered. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. nine patients (i.e., 6 with sinusitis and subdural empyema, 3 with sinusitis and brain abscess) did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess,  and required surgical drainage of inflamed sinuses. these findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.

TI  == diagnosis and management of anaerobic infections of the head and neck.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria are important pathogens in head and neck infections such as chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis, chronic mastoiditis, head and neck abscesses, cervical adenitis, parotitis, and postoperative infection. bacteroides sp (bacteroides melaninogenicus group, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides fragilis group), peptostreptococcus sp, and fusobacterium sp predominate. the observed recent increase in the number of beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteroides sp isolated in head and neck infections has been associated with increased failure rates of the penicillins in the management of these infections. the pathogenicity of these organisms is expressed through their ability not only  to survive penicillin therapy but also to shield penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. because of these direct and indirect virulent characteristics of anaerobic bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial therapy must be directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == the acute phase of experimental infection with trypanosoma cruzi is more severe in mice monoassociated with strict anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == 1. the influence of some components of the normal human intestinal flora on the acute phase of experimental infection with strain cl of trypanosoma cruzi was studied in 30-day-old germ-free or gnotobiotic cfw (lob) mice monoassociated with bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp or clostridium sp by intragastric inoculation of 10(6) bacteria 10 days before the intraperitoneal infection with 5 x 10(3) trypomastigotes/g body weight. 2. significantly earlier parasitemia peak  and mortality were observed in bacteroides fragilis- and clostridium-associated mice (16.75 +/- 0.96 and 15.00 +/- 1.15 days, respectively) when compared with germfree animals (18.83 +/- 1.17 days). more precocious mortality (10.40 +/- 2.06 days) and, curiously, much lower blood parasitemia were observed in peptostreptococcus-associated mice than in other gnotobiotic mice. 3. the extent  of cardiac tissue parasitism decreased in the following order: germfree, b. fragilis-associated, clostridium-associated, and peptostreptococcus-associated animals. the levels of inflammatory reaction decreased in the following order: germfree, peptostreptococcus-associated, clostridium-associated, and b. fragilis-associated mice. 4. these results show that the acute phase of experimental infection with t. cruzi was more severe in mice associated with strict anaerobic bacteria when compared with germfree animals. this suggests that a normal intestinal flora may be another factor, in addition to nutritional and genetic factors, responsible for the different susceptibility of organisms of the same species infected with t. cruzi.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == in the western world, bacterial vaginosis is now being recognised as the commonest cause of vaginitis. bacterial vaginosis represents a major disturbance  in vaginal microbiology with the massive overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina. accordingly, high population levels of non-fragilis bacteroides sp., peptostreptococci, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus sp. are found, with a corresponding decline in lactobacillus sp. excessive polyamine production by anaerobes is responsible for the offensive vaginal discharge, and g. vaginalis adherent to epithelial cells produces pathognomonic clue cells, which together with elevated vaginal ph constitute the  hallmark of diagnosis. the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood and the role of sexual transmission is controversial. bacterial vaginosis may cause symptoms but is frequently asymptomatic. it is more than a nuisance vaginal infection in that (a) many patients have recurrent episodes, and (b) it has recently been associated with post-partum and post-operative fever, upper genital tract infection, amnionitis and prematurity. therapy for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis is currently dominated by metronidazole; however, clindamycin and a host of new agents may enjoy similar success. women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis constitute a major therapeutic problem, as do pregnant women. the cause of frequently recurring bacterial vaginosis remains obscure. new data are presented here indicating that early recurrences are due to relapse and not reinfection. no evidence has emerged that suggests that relapse is due to antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == microbiology of empyema in children and adolescents.
AB  == the microbiology of empyema was studied in 72 children and adolescents whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 93 organisms, 60 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, were isolated. aerobic bacteria was isolated in 48 (67%) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 17 (24%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 7 (10%). the predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and staphylococcus aureus (10). the predominant anaerobes were bacteroides sp (15 isolates, including 7 bacteroides fragilis group and 5 bacteroides melaninogenicus group), anaerobic cocci (9), and fusobacterium sp (6). beta-lactamase activity was detected in at least one isolate in 20 (37%) of the 54 tested patients. these included all 8 tested s aureus and 7 b fragilis group, 3 of 10 h influenzae, 2 of 4 b melaninogenicus group, and 1 of 2 klebsiella pneumoniae. most cases of s pneumoniae and h influenzae were associated with pneumonia. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, subdiaphragmatic abscess, and abscesses of dental or oropharyngeal origin. the data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema in children and adolescents.

TI  == the role of bacterial vaginosis as a cause of amniotic fluid infection, chorioamnionitis and prematurity--a review.
AB  == antepartum bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy has been related to premature delivery, the recovery of microorganisms from amniotic fluid of women in premature labor with intact membranes, to histologic chorioamnionitis and to the  recovery of microorganisms from the placenta or membranes. microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are commonly recovered from the amniotic fluid and chorioamnion of patients who deliver prematurely. in addition, bacterial vaginosis is associated with maternal infectious morbidity during labor and in the postpartum period. very little is known of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which bacterial vaginosis may cause preterm labor and/or premature  rupture of the membranes. however, it is of interest to speculate on possible mechanisms. the high concentration of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the vagina and cervix of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis may increase the possibility of an ascending infection via the cervix, decidua, fetal membranes, maternal placenta, and amniotic fluid. some of the bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis such as bacteroides sp. are particularly virulent. certain bacteria produce enzymes that potentially could affect the fetal membranes or maternal deciduae. bacteroides sp. and group b streptococcus produce proteases. protease enzymes reduce the chorioamniotic membrane strength in vitro. it is even possible that a high concentration of bacteria in the lower genital tract could produce enough proteases to weaken the fetal membrane strength causing premature  rupture of the membranes. bacterial lipases could also produce tissue injury. schwarz et al. demonstrated that lysosomes within fetal membrane cells contain phospholipase a2 in high concentrations. phospholipase a2 is a precursor of prostaglandin synthesis and the destruction of lysosomes within deciduae or chorioamnion cells may induce prostaglandin synthesis resulting in uterine contractions. bejar et al. found a high rate of phospholipase a2 production by bacteroides sp., anaerobic streptococci, fusobacterium sp., and g. vaginalis. benett et al. demonstrated that bacterial products of group b streptococci, viridans streptococci, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis but not of lactobacillus sp. increase the synthesis of prostaglandins in the membranes. thus, selected bacteria, including some closely related to bacterial vaginosis may play a role in the initiation of uterine contractions by stimulating prostaglandin synthesis. in an alternative mechanism, either the release of prostaglandin in the membrane or uterine contraction could cause microbreaks of the membrane that allow bacterial colonization of the membrane.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == new diterpenoid antibiotics, spirocardins a and b.
AB  == new antibiotics spirocardins a and b were isolated from the culture broth of an actinomycete isolated from a soil sample collected near lake hibara, fukushima prefecture, japan. the producing strain was classified as nocardia sp. sank 64282. the antibiotics were isolated from the culture filtrate by solvent extraction and purified further by silica gel and preparative reverse phase column chromatography. they were primarily active against gram-positive bacteria  including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and limited species of gram-negative bacteria such as bacteroides fragilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. they were also moderately active against several species of mycoplasma. the molecular formulae of spirocardins a and b were c20h30o6 and c20h32o6, respectively. from their physico-chemical characteristics they were revealed to be diterpenoid antibiotics with closely related structures and the former was easily converted to the latter by the reduction with nabh4.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  == the recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. these include  respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. the important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) include staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella sp. the anaerobic blpb are all bacteroidiaceae and include bacteroides fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus group, b. oralis, b. oris-buccae, and fusobacterium sp. laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity  of these organisms and the distribution of these blpb in various infections are reviewed. blpb may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic blpb require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections.

AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == use of antibiotics in the management of postirradiation wound infection and sepsis.
AB  == ionizing gamma irradiation depresses the host defenses and enhances the susceptibility of the immunocompromised host to local and systemic infection due  to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. trauma and wounding act synergistically and decrease the survival after exposure to irradiation. the current antimicrobial agents suitable for controlling serious infections and their use in post irradiation local and systemic infection with and without trauma are discussed. the experience gained in managing immunocompromised patients following chemotherapy is reviewed. empiric single agent or combination  agent therapy should be directed at the eradication of potential gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. the most important organisms known to cause these infections are pseudomonas sp. and enterobacteriaceae. management of intra-abdominal infections following trauma should include early surgical correlation and antimicrobials directed against the bacteroides fragilis group and enterobacteriaceae. staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes cause most skin and soft tissue infections following trauma. chemoprophylaxis of enteric sources of systemic infection can be achieved by antimicrobials that selectively inhibit the enterobacteriaceae sp. and preserve the anaerobic flora.  the management of infection in the injured and irradiated host includes supportive and restorative therapy. supportive therapy includes debridement and cleansing of wounds, fluids, immunoglobulin, and antimicrobials. restorative therapy includes definite surgery repair and replenishment of the immune system by use of immunomodulators, growth factors, and bone marrow transplantation. further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of presently available drugs and experimental agents in the irradiated and traumatized host.

AB  == one hundred eighty-eight patients were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial to compare the safety and effectiveness of 1 to 2 gm cefotetan every 12 hours with those of 1 to 2 gm cefoxitin every 6 hours in patients with intra-abdominal infections. most of the infections were community acquired, were  associated with gastrointestinal tract perforation, and were caused by both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. the median duration of therapy was 6 days for each group. the clinical response rate for the 95 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group was 98%, and that for the 43 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin  group was 95%. bacteriologically, 97% of the 58 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 89% of the 27 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group had a satisfactory or presumed satisfactory response; two patients in the cefotetan group and three in the cefoxitin group were considered bacteriologic failures. cefotetan was as effective as cefoxitin in eradicating bacteroides fragilis and other species of bacteroides, clostridium sp., and gram-negative bacilli. the incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions for cefotetan (27%) was not statistically different from that for cefoxitin (17%). no clinically significant  differences were detected between the treatment groups in changes in the results  of clinical laboratory tests performed before and after treatment; a decrease in  hematocrit among the cefotetan group was statistically greater (p = 0.04) than that for the cefoxitin group, and a decrease in serum creatinine level for the cefoxitin group was greater than that for the cefotetan group (p = 0.02). cefotetan may represent an effective, safe, and cost-saving alternative to cefoxitin for the prompt treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibility of 1,117 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the agar dilution technique. metronidazole was the most active  agent; only propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces sp. isolates were resistant.  clindamycin and chloramphenical were the next most effective agents. beta-lactam  antibiotics, with the exception of penicillin, were active against most anaerobes other than the bacteroides fragilis group. at a breakpoint of 8 mg/l, 25% of fusobacterium spp. and 30% of the non-fragilis bacteroides spp. were resistant to penicillin. the highest resistance to beta-lactams was seen in the b. fragilis group. within the indole-positive members of the group, resistance rates of 71% were seen for cefoxitin, 49% for moxalactam, 79% for cefotaxime, 22% for piperacillin and 89% for penicillin. we conclude that metronidazole has the most  predictable in vitro activity against common clinical anaerobic isolates and that resistance to beta-lactams was frequent and of potential clinical importance as these latter agents are frequently used in the prophylaxis and therapy of mixed anaerobic infections.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides sp. (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides fragilis), peptostreptococci and fusobacterium sp. are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (rti). these organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative  and anaerobic bacteria. a recent increase in numbers of bet-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in rti has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. these  infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis and lung abscesses. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.

AB  == norfloxacin (nflx), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing  53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). the actual regimen followed was that the drug  was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. on the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the  fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. susceptibilities  against nflx and nalidixic acid (na) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. the results obtained are summarized below. 1. following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. and enterobacter sp. of enterobacteriaceae was noted. the 3 strains other than e. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. no constant trend was observed in the isolation of proteus sp. organisms belong to enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2  cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. among other gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of plesiomonas sp. pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after  the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. however, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. no change was noticed in the number of isolates of enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for micrococcus  sp. and ylo. the average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. among anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == synergistic combinations of antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == studies evaluating the in vitro and in vivo synergistic potential of combined antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria are reviewed. most studies evaluated therapy against bacteroides sp. (mostly bacteroides fragilis group). the combinations found to be most effective against b. fragilis were between metronidazole and clindamycin, spiramycin or gentamicin and between clindamycin and aminoglycosides. against bacteroides melaninogenicus the effective combinations were penicillin or clindamycin plus gentamicin and metronidazole and spiramycin or gentamicin. occasional synergy was observed against clostridium sp. and anaerobic cocci with clindamycin and gentamicin. synergistic combinations have the potential of clinical use in serious anaerobic infections.

TI  == role of anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  == bacteroides sp. (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis and bacteroides  fragilis), peptostreptococci and fusobacterium sp. are important pathogens in upper respiratory tract infections. a recent increase in numbers of beta-lactamase-producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in upper respiratory tract infections has been associated with increased failure rates of  penicillins in eradication of these infections. these infections include chronic  otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis and lung abscesses. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect  penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  == patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. these infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. with treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent;  however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. among the aerobic gram-positive organisms,  several varieties of streptococci such as group b streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen.  among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is escherichia coli. klebsiella sp. and proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are peptostreptococci and peptococci. clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are bacteroides bivius and bacteroides disiens. bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. other organisms encountered are chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.

TI  == bacterial synergy in pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora are responsible for pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). the most frequent pathogens appear to be neisseria gonorrhoea and  anaerobic bacteria (most commonly anaerobic cocci and bacteroides sp.). recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of chlamydia trachomatis in up to a third  of these infections. although n. gonorrhoea is frequently recovered from cervical cultures, it is less commonly recovered from intra-abdominal sites. recent studies have demonstrated the in-vivo synergistic relationship between n. gonorrhoeae and bacteroides fragilis. the growth of each component of the mixed infection was enhanced when these were present together in an abscess. furthermore, the emergence of encapsulated strains was enhanced in these infections. this synergy enables the organisms to cause more severe local and systemic damage to the host. therapeutic intervention should include the use of antimicrobial agents effective against both the aerobic and anaerobic components  of the mixed infection. unless such therapy is given, the infection may persist.  it is also recommended to use antimicrobials that possess synergy between them against the bacterial pathogens. agents effective against the anaerobic pathogens are metronidazole, clindamycin and cefoxitin. antimicrobials effective against the gram-positive aerobic pathogens and n. gonorrhoeae are spiramycin and penicillins. aminoglycosides or third generation cephalosporins are effective against gram-negative enterics. the combination of metronidazole and spiramycin has shown to be synergistic against mixed infections of bacteroides sp. and n. gonorrhoeae.

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria in respiratory tract infections in children.
AB  == bacteroides sp (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides  fragilis), peptostreptococci, and fusobacteria are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (rti). these organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria. evidence supporting their virulence is provided by studies showing their synergistic potentials in mixed infections and their increased virulence when encapsulated. a recent increase in numbers of beta-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in rti has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. these infections include chronic  otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis, and lung abscesses. the pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. the synergy that exists between different aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the respiratory tract is due to several pathogenic mechanisms. these mechanisms include the production of a capsule, which protects organisms from phagocytosis, and the production of beta-lactamase, which inactivates penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. both of these mechanisms enhance infection and induce complications. however, more work is necessary to prevent encapsulation and the production of enzymes. data, thus far, indicate that there  are therapeutic modalities that can be used to prevent these occurrences and eliminate many mixed rti.

TI  == microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == the charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. all patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. the most common organisms cultured were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10  patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, enterobacter, 16  cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. the classic isolates, escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. to determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and s. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. the spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically  ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those  with acute peritonitis. despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.

TI  == evidence that polygalacturonic acid may not be a major source of carbon and energy for some colonic bacteroides species.
AB  == five bacteroides species that are found in the human colon can utilize polygalacturonic acid (pga) when they are grown in laboratory media: bacteroides  thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides fragilis  subsp. a, and bacteroides sp. strain 3452a (an unnamed dna-dna homology group). pga-degrading enzymes from b. thetaiotaomicron have been isolated and characterized previously. to determine whether a pga lyase activity in human feces could be attributed to any of these species, we first determined the properties of pga lyases from the other four bacteroides species. pga lyases from all the bacteroides species were soluble, cell associated, and inducible by pga.  all had similar ph optima (8.4 to 8.8) and similar molecular weights (50,000). all activities were enhanced by calcium. the pga lyases from the five species differed with respect to isoelectric point: b. thetaiotaomicron (pi 7.5), b. vulgatus (pi 7.7), b. ovatus (pi 5.8, 7.2), b. fragilis subsp. a (pi 6.1), and bacteroides sp. strain 3452a (pi 7.7). the pga lyase activity in human feces resembled those of the bacteroides pga lyases in that it had a ph optimum of 8.4  to 8.8 and was enhanced by calcium. however, it differed from the bacteroides pga lyases both with respect to isoelectric point (pi 4.2 to 4.4) and molecular weight (100,000). on the basis of these findings, it appears that the pga lyase activity in human feces is not produced by any of the bacteroides species surveyed in this survey. moreover, there was no detectable pga lyase activity in  feces that had the same properties as the bacteroides enzymes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == roxithromycin, formerly known as ru 28965 (9-[o [(2-methoxyethoxy)methyl]oxime]-erythromycin), is a novel 14 atom-membered semisynthetic macrolide with an antibacterial spectrum directed towards gram-positive cocci and bacilli, gram-negative cocci and some parvobacteriaceae.  the in vitro antibacterial activity of roxithromycin was compared with those of erythromycin and spiramycin against 275 clinical isolates by using 2-fold broth macro-dilution tests. the antibacterial spectrum of roxithromycin and erythromycin were qualitatively comparable (including the bacteriostatic type of  activity and the profile of resistance), but minimal inhibitory concentrations of erythromycin were generally one half those of roxithromycin, except for corynebacterium sp. and bacteroides fragilis against which the new macrolide was  more active. on the other hand, roxithromycin exhibited a superior in vivo antibacterial activity in laboratory animals, being up to six times more potent than erythromycin in curing experimentally infected mice. roxithromycin showed high blood levels and long half-lives of elimination in rodents after oral administration, and its bioavailability amounted to 72% in mice and 85% in rats,  compared to less than 10% for erythromycin. roxithromycin was widely distributed  throughout the body with a high degree of penetration into all tissues, particularly in the lungs.

TI  == dna probes for identification of clinically important bacteroides species.
AB  == conventional procedures for identifying gram-negative anaerobes such as bacteroides spp. are cumbersome and time-consuming. a simpler approach would be to use dna probes to identify these organisms. since many different species of gram-negative anaerobes are isolated from clinical specimens, the most useful dna probes would be probes that identify a few clinically significant groups of anaerobes. to obtain such probes, we cloned hindiii-digested chromosomal dna from various bacteroides species and then screened these probes, labeled with 32p by nick translation, for hybridization to dna from various species of bacteroides, fusobacterium, and other gram-negative bacteria. we identified three dna probes (pbfii-4, pbfii-5, and pbfii-6) that hybridized specifically to dna from bacteroides fragilis, the species that accounts for about half of all isolates from clinical specimens containing anaerobes. we identified one dna probe (pbe-3) that hybridized to all members of the b. fragilis group, a group of species that  resemble b. fragilis with respect to fermentation pattern and antibiotic resistances. we also identified one probe (pbo-21) that hybridized to dna from all bacteroides sp. strains as well as to dna from strains of fusobacterium necrophorum and fusobacterium nucleatum. pbo-21, but not pbe-3, cross-hybridized  with a cloned bacteroides sp. 16s rrna gene. the limit of detection for these probes was 10(6) bacteria. the probes could detect b. fragilis in blood culture medium and in mixed cultures with other gram-negative bacteria. attempts to use biotin-labeled dna probes instead of 32p-labeled probes were not successful because the bacteroides sp. extracts contained material that bound the streptoavidin-peroxidase detection reagent.

AB  == fosfomycin (fom) is a synthetic antibiotic having a unique structural formula and bactericidal mechanism and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against various bacterial species. it has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. as therapy, fom-na in a daily dose of 4 g (2 g x 2) was given by intravenous drip infusion for 5 to 10 days to 6 cases with infectious diseases (2 cases of acute cholecystitis, 3 cases of acute localized peritonitis due to phlegmonous appendicitis and 1 case of acute diffuse peritonitis due to perforative appendicitis). the clinical response was rated as "excellent" in 1 case, "good" in 4 cases, "fair" in 1 case and "poor" in none. no adverse effects were observed in any of the patients. six clinical isolates were obtained, and these consisted  of 4 strains of escherichia coli and 1 strain each of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  bacteroides fragilis. the mics of fom were from 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml for e. coli, 50 micrograms/ml for k. pneumoniae, and 100 micrograms/ml for b. fragilis.  fom-na was administered to the 6 cases intravenously in a dose of 2 g before surgery, and tissue specimens and body fluid samples were taken during the operation. the fom concentration was determined by bioassay with a proteus sp. (mb 838) as the test organism. the mean fom concentration in bile from the common bile duct was 61.85 +/- 17.13 micrograms/ml (n = 5) at 95 to 108 minutes after fom-na intravenous bolus injection. the mean fom concentration in the gall bladder bile was 80.06 +/- 92.36 micrograms/ml, while that in the gall bladder wall was 146.65 +/- 39.10 micrograms/g. the mean fom concentration in purulent ascites was 58.20 +/- 13.29 micrograms/ml, 36.22 +/- 14.63 micrograms/g in the appendix wall and 12.64 +/- 11.34 micrograms/ml in pus in the appendix. the fom concentrations in the infected tissues and body fluids thus exceeded the mics of  fom for the pathogenic bacteria. therefore, fom-na appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of infections encountered in the surgical field.

AB  == in the present study we sought to determine whether serum antibody was present against microorganisms which predominate in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis (sp). subjects with sp were often seropositive for eubacterium brachy, fusobacterium nucleatum e3c22, and peptostreptococcus micros, whereas subjects with juvenile periodontitis (jp) and  subjects with healthy periodontium (hp) were not. both sp and jp subjects were more frequently seropositive for bacteroides gingivalis, f. nucleatum d52b16, and f. nucleatum e1d1 than were hp subjects. the data were most striking for b. gingivalis, for which both the incidence and the magnitude of specific antibody was clearly elevated for sp and jp subject groups. however, sp subjects generally had either a high antibody titer or no detectable titer. in contrast, jp and hp subjects generally had at least very small amounts of antibody. except at very low levels of antibody, neither sp nor jp groups differed significantly from the  hp group for antibody to eubacterium nodatum, bacteroides intermedius (homology group 4197 or 8944), or lactobacillus minutus antibody. there was a high frequency of antibody to e. nodatum, with very high titers in all groups despite  the fact that this organism is rarely found in hp subjects. for eubacterium timidum, the jp group was clearly more frequently seropositive than the hp group. despite high levels of l. minutus in subgingival flora, none of the 50 sp subjects had a detectable antibody titer, and only four of the hp and jp subjects had detectable antibody. these results indicate that many organisms in the subgingival flora elicit antibody responses. b. gingivalis is probably the best example among the species tested. however, some organisms that are present in high concentration, e.g., l. minutus, apparently fail to induce significant antibody responses.

AB  == to investigate the modifying role of intestinal microflora in the metabolism of chemical carcinogens in vivo, we subjected bile from fischer rats treated per os  with chemical carcinogens and related compounds to a mutagenicity assay in the presence and absence of a cell-free extract from human feces. a mixture of the bile sample and potassium phosphate buffer was incubated in the presence or absence of human cell-free fecal extract and then further incubated with a bacterial suspension of salmonella typhimurium tester strains ta98 or ta100. bile from rats treated with 1-nitropyrene (1-np) produced about 2700 and 400 revertants per plate in strain ta98 in the presence and absence of the fecal extract, respectively. there was a drug dose- and bile volume-related response. treatment of 1-np-bile with beta-glucuronidase, but not aryl sulfatase, enhanced  its mutagenicity. cell-free extracts of some strains of intestinal bacteria (bacteroides fragilis atcc 12044, b. vulgatus atcc 8482, b. thetaiotaomicron atcc 12290, bacteroides sp. strain 524, eubacterium eligens vpi c15-48, peptostreptococcus sp. strain 204 and escherichia coli a-5-18) also enhanced the  mutagenicity of 1-np-bile. these bacterial cell-free extracts hydrolyzed the synthetic beta-d-glucuronides of phenolphthalein and/or p-nitrophenol. these data indicate that the glucuronide(s) of 1-np-metabolite(s) secreted into bile can be  hydrolyzed in the intestine by bacterial beta-glucuronidases to potent mutagenic  aglycone(s).

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == new orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, proteus sp. indole-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. none of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against bacteroides fragilis. ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or  ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though  the difference was less marked. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against s. aureus. results with agar and with broth were comparable. the activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the mic values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). the new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.

TI  == bacteriology of chronic tonsillitis in young adults.
AB  == tonsils were obtained from 22 young adults (mean age, 23 years) suffering from chronic tonsillitis. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained from core tonsillar cultures in all patients, yielding an average of 9.0 isolates (5.3 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. the predominant anaerobic isolates were  bacteroides sp, fusobacterium sp, and gram-positive cocci. the predominant aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and hemophilus sp. beta-lactamase-production was noted in 32 isolates recovered from 18 tonsils (82%). these included all eight isolates of s aureus and five b fragilis, and 11  of 24 b melaninogenicus group (46%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in young adults with chronic tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in most of the patients.

TI  == infection and the use of antibiotics in crohn's disease.
AB  == many patients with crohn's disease present with the complications of infection. hence, antibiotics play an important role in the medical management of acute inflammatory disease, persistent perianal disease and as prophylaxis for surgical operations. the author's group has demonstrated that bacteria colonize the serosa of the bowel in patients with crohn's disease in 27% of cases. furthermore, pathogenic bacteria could be recovered from the lymph nodes in 33% of patients with crohn's disease, compared with only 5% in a controlled population. extraintestinal bacterial colonization was, therefore, present in approximately half of all patients requiring an operation for crohn's disease. the principal bacteria isolated at these sites were escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, proteus sp and diphtheroids. a prospective controlled trial on the use of 1 month's antimicrobial therapy in patients with relapse of crohn's disease revealed that metronidazole was associated with a 57% response rate, compared with a response of only 17% in patients receiving no metronidazole. these interim findings suggest that metronidazole may have a role in the management of acute relapse in patients with crohn's disease.

TI  == trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in gram-negative species and the development of agents  to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of gram-negative species. there have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. these have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of  compounds which by virtue of kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. there has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for  critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. there has been  the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative species. there has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to gram-negative aerobic species. bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. the widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. it is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which  will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. but the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development  of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.

AB  == three healthy lactating quarters of a friesland cow were each experimentally infected with a pure culture of a strain of either bacteroides fragilis, eubacterium lentum or a peptostreptococcus sp. respectively. the onset and progression to clinical mastitis was monitored 12 hourly by examination for clinical signs of inflammation, bacterial culture, somatic cell counts and with a strip cup. all infected quarters developed clinical mastitis within 24 hours. the 2 quarters infected with b. fragilis and e. lentum respectively were treated 4 times consecutively at 12 hour intervals, commencing at 24 h by intramammary instillation of 10 ml of a mixture containing 200 mg lincomycin hydrochloride, 200 mg neomycin sulphate and 5 mg methylprednisolone (lincocin forte, upjohn). both quarters became clinically normal and no bacteria could be detected in the secretions 12 hours after the first treatment. at 36 hours the strip cup became negative, and the somatic cell count dropped to less than 500 x 10(3) at 72 hours after the initial treatment. the quarter infected with a peptostreptococcus sp. was unable to overcome the infection by natural means when intramammary treatment was delayed for the first 36 hours after the onset of clinical mastitis. subsequent treatment of this quarter gave results similar to those treated earlier.

TI  == the frequency and some characteristics of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various forms of bovine mastitis.
AB  == the prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. the study involved 147 friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. all herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. no anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. only anaerobes were present in  10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. a variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. peptococcus spp. was associated with corynebacterium pyogenes and bacteroides spp. with staphylococcus aureus and/or streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-g but all the gram negative rods were resistant. in addition, all b. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. the ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain  of peptococcus indolicus and a peptostreptococcus sp.

TI  == piperacillin sodium: antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions.
AB  == piperacillin sodium is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad range of antibacterial activity that includes gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci (except penicillinase-producing s. aureus) and anaerobic pathogens such as clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis. piperacillin inhibits many of the members of the enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella sp and pseudomonas, at lower concentrations than required for carbenicillin and ticarcillin. piperacillin sodium is administered by intramuscular and intravenous injection and is widely distributed throughout body fluids and tissues. like other newer penicillins, piperacillin is excreted by both renal and biliary mechanisms. the primary route of elimination is by glomerular filtration, which results in high urinary concentrations of the unchanged compound. piperacillin has been approved  for patients with serious infection caused by susceptible strains of specific organisms in intra-abdominal, urinary tract, gynecologic, lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, bone and joint, and gonococcal infections and septicemia. as with other penicillins, piperacillin has a low frequency of toxicity. the usual dose of piperacillin in adults with serious infections with normal renal function is 3-4 g every 4-6 hr as a 20-30 min infusion, with a maximum dose of 24 g per day. it is stable in most large volume parenteral solutions. less serious infectins (requiring smaller dosages) may be treated by intramuscular injection; however, no more than 2 g should be given at any one injection site. overall, piperacillin has a greater degree of activity than other penicillins. evidence from prospective studies indicates that piperacillin is a highly effective agent for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.

(27 strains) and bacteroides fragilis (27 strains).  activities were evaluated at bacteriostatic and also bactericidal levels with particular reference to time of exposure of microbes to the drug. the minimal drug concentrations producing minimal reduction of colony-forming units at time intervals of 3, 6 and 24 hours after exposure to the drug--approximations to the  theoretical bacteriostatic concentrations--were designated as 3-h, 6-h and 24-h mrcs, respectively. conventional mic yielding no turbidity after incubation of antibiotic-containing broth for 24 hours was also determined. the minimal concentrations of the drug producing 99.9% killing at time intervals of 3, 6 and  24 hours after exposure to the drug were designated as 3-h, 6-h and 24-h mlcs, respectively. assuming that the apparent mode of action of a drug is bactericidal when the ratio of bactericidal-bacteriostatic concentrations is low (less than or equal to 4) and bacteriostatic when high (greater than or equal to 8), then cefmetazole appeared to be a bactericidal drug to a considerable number of gram-negative strains when the exposure time exceeded a period of 6 hours. the data that the mode of action of this drug is bactericidal with such relatively brief exposure times--indicating rapid decrease of colony-forming units--would suggest cefmetazole is an excellent antibacterial agent and would be a useful drug in treatment of bacterial infections.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). a total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). a total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). the predominant aerobic isolates were s. epidermidis, s. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas sp., and group d streptococcus. the predominant anaerobic isolates were: p. acnes, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and bacteroides sp. blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: s. aureus, e. coli, peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and b. fragilis. the numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). gram-negative enteric rods and group d streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and p. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. all children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. these data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.

TI  == bacterial studies of peritoneal cavity and postoperative surgical wound drainage  following perforated appendix in children.
AB  == this study reports bacterial specimens obtained from 112 children presenting with a ruptured appendix. additional samples were studied from 11 of these patients who developed a postoperative surgical draining wound. bacterial growth occurred  in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. there were 144 aerobic isolates (1.4 per specimen). the predominant isolates were: e. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); group d streptococcus (12 specimens); and p. aeruginosa (9 specimens). there were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). the predominant isolates were: 157 bacteroides spp. (including 92 b. fragilis group and 26 b. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 peptococcus sp.; 29 peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 fusobactenium sp.; and 16 clostridium sp. b. fragilis and peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. these included all isolates of b. fragilis and six of the 23 bacteroides sp. forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds. the predominant organisms were: b. fragilis (8 specimens); e. coli (6 specimens); peptostreptococcus sp. (5 specimens); and three specimens each of p. aeruginosa and peptococcus sp. most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.

TI  == the identification of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli isolated from clinical infections.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli isolated from specimens submitted to the routine  diagnostic bacteriology laboratory and regarded as significant pathogens were identified by conventional bacteriological tests; 399 strains isolated from 356 specimens submitted from 332 patients were studied and most were readily identified by the results of a combined set of morphological, biochemical, tolerance and antibiotic disk resistance tests; b. fragilis has particular pathogenic potential and was the commonest species isolated, accounting for greater than 50% of strains. the next commonest was b. asaccharolyticus with 55 strains, and 16 other species or groups were represented by smaller numbers. many (68%) were from infections related to the gastro-intestinal tract, but there were significant numbers from infections of the male and female genito-urinary tracts, the head, neck and central nervous system and from a variety of soft tissue infections. most infections were mixed, and a pure culture of a bacteroides sp. was obtained from only 26% of infections; two or more strains of bacteroides were recovered from 55 infections. the specific identification of bacteroides may help the bacteriologist to judge the significance of laboratory findings, influence the patient's management and prognosis and help determine the source of infection.

TI  == comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar  diffusion tests. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. saccharolytic bacteroides strains (39 b. fragilis, 6 b. thetaiotaomicron, 4 b. vulgatus) showed broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and mics of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees c. with strains of b. oralis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, b. corrodens, veillonella sp. and megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution mics were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes, eubacterium sp., bifidobacterium sp. and clostridium sp. had broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. with the great majority of strains tested, mics were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and mic. with gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution mic and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for p. acnes). when calculating the regression lines for agar dilution mics and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for p. acnes). with b. fragilis and other bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution mics and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.

(all of the former b. fragilis subspecies). the findings were compared with those of routine anaerobic bacteriology and gas liquid chromatography for short chain fatty acids. examination by i.f.a. was a sensitive (100%) and specific (90.3%) means of identifying b. fragilis. use of the pooled serum was sensitive (100%) but less specific (64.3%) than the capsular antiserum (90.3%) although it had the advantage of detecting bacteroides species  other than b. fragilis. the capsular serum i.f.a. gave 9.7% false positives and no false negatives. the predictive value of a positive identification of b. fragilis in a clinical specimen using this anticapsular serum i.f.a. test was 80%; with the pooled bacteroides group-serum it was 60%. the predictive value of  a negative test was 100% for both sera, indicating that a negative i.f.a. test is a reliable index of the absence of bacteroides from the culture i.f.a. of clinical material provides a rapid (less than 2 h) specific and sensitive means for the diagnosis of b. fragilis infections and would be of use in a clinical laboratory.

AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.

AB  == the in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, with chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 bacteroides fragilis, 13 b. thetaiotaomicron, 14 b. oralis, 16 sphaerophorus varius etc.) had mic values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. very similar results (mic, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. in concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (mic, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to b. fragilis or other bacteroides species. members of the fusobacterium and sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. with both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (p. acnes, peptostreptococcus spp., peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. of 37 clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to c. perfringens, c. septicum, c. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. only one strain each of c. perfringens and clostridium sp. had an mic of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. a standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 bacteroidaceae, 18 peptococcaceae and 20 c, (p.) acnes strains. only a poor correlation was observed between mic and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.

TI  == quantitative microflora of the vagina.
AB  == this study enumerated the predominant vaginal flora in 25 healthy patients: 18 prenatal (six with and 12 without gonorrhea) and seven nonpregnant without gonorrhea. all 25 patients had aerobes and 19 of the 25 had anerobes isolated in  titers of greater than or equal to 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu per milliliter). the most frequently isolated microorganism was the lactobacillus (aerobic and anaerobic species) followed by c. vaginale, viridans streptococci, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and bifidobacterium sp. bacteroides fragilis was not isolated. there were no significant differences in the frequency of isolation of any specific microorganism or bacterial counts between pregnant and nonpregnant women or between pregnant women with and without gonorrhea (p greater than 0.05), except pregnant patients had significantly higher total facultative counts associated with significantly lower anaerobic lactobacilli counts and higher c. vaginale counts (p less than 0.01) than in nonpregnant patients.

TI  == susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera bacteroides, fusobacterium, sphaerophorus, veillonella, clostridium, corynebacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. all the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 peptococcaceae, including 21 peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 peptococcus variabilis; 65 corynebacterium acnes and 29 clostridium strains, including 13 c. perfringens) were sensitive (mic values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 bacteroides fragilis, 12 b. thetaiotaomicron, 7 b. vulgatus, 13 b. oralis, 4 b. melaninogenicus, 10 sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). erythromycin at concentrations of  6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 b. fragilis, 4 fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 sph. freundi, 10 sph. varius). the present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.

TI  == a modified plate holding system for anaerobic cultures.
AB  == a modified plate holding system for anaerobes has been developed which: 1) effectively reduces the volume of oxygen-free gas required, 2) promotes earlier bacterial growth, and 3) monitors the anaerobic atmosphere of the holding vessel  and the rate of gas flow. cultures of bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, c. septicum, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptococcus sp. and propionibacterium sp. were evaluated for optimal growth. all cultures grew as well as or better when preincubated in the holding system for one to three hours  then incubated in a gaspak system for the remainder of the 24 hours, as compared  to incubation only in the gaspak or holding system for the entire 24-hour period.

TI  == [antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  == antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, bacteroides and fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with  metronidazole. in addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against p. prevotii, b. fragilis ss. fragilis and f. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in gam broth containing  of 4 mic, 2 mic, 1 mic and 1/2 mic of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. all the strains of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus including p. anaerobius, p. saccharolyticus, p. prevotii and ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of bacteroides including b. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). to this concentration all strains of fusobacterium including f. varium (20 strains), f. mortiferum (2 strains) and other fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

TI  == tryptophanase of fecal flora as a possible factor in the etiology of colon cancer.
AB  == twenty-three strains of intestinal anaerobes obtained from two laboratories were  examined for indole production from tryptophan. among the 23 isolates tested, three of bacteroides fragilis thetaiotaomicron and one citrobacter sp. were indole positive. the tryptophanase of the indole-positive strains of intestinal anaerobes was inducible by tryptophan and was susceptible to glucose repression.  the products of tryptophanase activity were formed in stoichiometric amounts by dialyzed, freshly prepared extracts. the tryptophan concentration and tryptophanase activity in feces from rats on an all-meat diet were significantly  higher than those in feces from rats on a normal diet. the results indicated that the higher tryptophanase activity in the feces of rats fed an all-meat diet is due to the inducibility of this enzyme by tryptophan and is not due to any inhibitor in the feces of rats on a normal diet. the results also suggested that  a population with a diet rich in meat has a greater chance for exposure to possible carcinogens such as indole and other tryptophan metabolites. this agrees with the hypothesis, based on epidemiologic data, that a high intake of meat may  be related to the development of colon cancer in man.

TI  == [a new butyric acid-producing bacteroides species: b. splanchnicus n. sp. (author's transl)].
AB  == three butyric acid-producing saccharolytic bacteroides cultures (1651/6, bm 158,  and ipp 3751) were described by werner and reichertz in 1971 (zbl.bakt.hyg., i. abt. orig. a 217,206-216). since then, 6 strains closely resembling 1651/6 were isolated from stool specimens and surgically removed appendices. in the present communication, strains 1651/6, s2/34, s3/38, s4/28, s6/6, a5/2 are described as members of a new species, bacteroides splanchnicus n.sp. the strains were morphologically very similar (gram negative non-sporing non-motile rods, 1-2.5 mu in length and 0.7 mu in width) and fermented glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, lactose, and arabinose (ph values of 4.6-5.4, moderate gas formation). negative reactions (ph values of 5.8-7.2) were observed with 20 other carbohydrates. the strains were positive in the glutamic acid decarboxylase test  and formed indole and h2s. in peptone-yeast extract broth and peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, and isovaleric acids were produced. washed cells of strains 1651/6 and s4/28 incubated anaerobically in sterile solutions of single amino acids produced butyrate from lysine only. abundant butyric acid was also produced from glucose. the in vitro activity of 15 antibiotics on 5 strains was studied by broth dilution tests. uniformly, the strains showed resistance to aminoglycosides and polymyxins (mic values, 60-500 mug/ml) and susceptibility to tetracyclines, lincomycin, clindamycin, rifampicin, and erythromycin (mic values, 0.05-0.5 mug/ml). chloramphenicol, penicillins, and cephalosporins showed bacteriostatic activity at concentrations of 5-40 mug/ml. the serological behaviour of 5 strains was studied in cross-agglutination and gel-diffusion experiments. cross-reactivity was pronounced in gel-diffusion tests using rabbit antisera and autoclaved extracts and extracts prepared by repeated deep-freezing and thawing of whole cell suspensions as antigens. however, antisera against the b. splanchnicus strains did not react with antigens of b. fragilis 6869, b. thetaiotaomicron as 126, b. vulgatus am 45 a, b. distasonis aii 104 and butyric acid-producing strains bm 158 and ipp 3751 in agglutination and gel-diffusion experiments, and there were no cross-reactions between b. splanchnicus antigens and antisera against b. fragilis 6869 and the other aforementioned strains. the new species has been confirmed by members of the icsb taxonomic subcommittee for gram negative anaerobic rods. strains 1651/6 and s4/28 have been deposited in the national collection of type cultures, london (nctc numbers 10825 and 10826). strain nctc 10825 (= 1651/6) is the type of the species, b. splanchnicus.

TI  == studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  == a study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on  a rumen fluid roll tube medium (m98-5). seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as propionibacterium acnes and eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as bacteroides clostridiiformis,  b. hypermegas and b. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as clostridium sp.).  two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. the distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy  source, minerals, reducing agent, trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). the growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by co(2) and rumen fluid. these preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen  anaerobes.

TI  == bacteroidaceae in thromboembolic disease: effects of cell wall components on blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro.
AB  == the effects of bacteroides sp., fusobacterium mortiferum, bacteroides fragilis, and sphaerophorus necrophorus on various parameters of blood coagulation in vivo  and in vitro were determined and compared to the coagulation effects of escherichia coli and salmonella minnesota, wild type and r595. intravenous injection of washed cells, culture filtrate, lipopolysaccharide, or lipid a of the anaerobic gram-negative microorganisms into mice resulted in acceleration of  coagulation. lipopolysaccharide and lipid a of the anaerobic microorganisms had no apparent effect on circulating platelets in mice or rabbits and did not cause  aggregation of human platelets in vitro. washed cells, lipopolysaccharide, and lipid a of bacteroides sp. and f. mortiferum also significantly accelerated the clotting time of recalcified platelet poor normal human plasma and c6-deficient rabbit plasma. lipid a, but not lipopolysaccharide, of e. coli and washed cells of s. minnesota r595 accelerated coagulation by a similar mechanism. these results indicated that bacteroides sp. and f. mortiferum can accelerate blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism which does not involve platelets  or terminal components of complement.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 601 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria to 10 different antimicrobial agents were determined by an agar-dilution technique. nearly all strains were resistant to kanamycin and gentamicin, although moderate activity to both drugs was noted with fusobacterium sp., anaerobic cocci, some strains of bacteroides melaninogenicus, and nonsporeforming gram-positive bacilli. chloramphenicol at 12.5 mug/ml inhibited all but three of  the strains tested. tetracycline at 6.25 mug/ml had high activity against all groups tested, with the exception that only 39% of strains of bacteroides fragilis were inhibited at this concentration. excluding certain species of bacteroides, the majority of anaerobes were inhibited by penicillin at 3.1 mug/ml or less and by cephalothin at 12.5 mug/ml or less. lincomycin at 6.2 mug/ml or less was active against nearly all strains. erythromycin at a concentration of 3.1 mug/ml was active against b. fragilis; however, erythromycin was less active  against the other groups. most of the minimal inhibitory concentrations of lincomycin exceeded those of clindamycin by fourfold. rifampin inhibited virtually all strains at 3.1 mug/ml.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
