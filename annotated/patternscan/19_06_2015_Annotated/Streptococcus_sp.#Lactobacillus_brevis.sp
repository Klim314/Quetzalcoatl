TI  == characterization of indigenous lactobacillus strains for probiotic properties.
AB  == background: probiotics are defined as adequate amount of live microorganisms able to confer health benefits on the host. currently, most commercially available probiotic products in the market belong to genera lactobacillus. traditional dairy products are usually rich source of lactobacillus strains with significant  health benefits. in order to evaluate the probiotic potential of these bacteria,  it is essential to assess their health benefits, efficacy, and safety. objectives: the probiotic efficacy of two lactobacillus strains namely lactobacillus pentosus lp05 and l. brevis lb32 was evaluated. they were previously isolated from ewes' milk in a rural area in east azerbaijan, iran. materials and methods: the selected isolates were tested for certain phenotypic characters and identified to genus and species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing  and species specific primers. further analysis included acid and bile resistance, antagonistic activity, cholesterol removing ability, survival in simulated gastric and upper intestine contents, aggregation and coaggregation properties. finally, the adhering ability of the selected lactobacillus strains to epithelial cells was tested using caco-2 cell lines. results: the selected isolates tolerated bile salt concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 3%, however their coefficient of inhibition were varied. both isolates hydrolyzed bile and grew at  ph values of 3, 4, and 5, while isolate lp05 was not able to hydrolyze arginine.  based on 16s rrna gene sequencing and species-specific primers, the isolates were identified as l. brevis lb32 and l. pentosus lp05. in contrast to simulated gastric conditions, the growth rate of the isolates in alkaline conditions of upper intestine increased significantly with the passage of time reaching its maximum in 24 hours. these 2 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, shigella dysenteriae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumonia. furthermore, l. brevis lb32 was able to reduce approximately 86% of cholesterol compared to l. pentosus lp05, which showed only 69% of reduction. higher aggregation and coaggregation percentage and adherence to caco-2 cell line was observed in l. pentosus lp05 compared to l. brevis lb32. conclusions: this research study proved the presence of viable probiotic lab microflora in the ewe milk with enhanced health benefits. the 2 selected lactobacillus strains could be exploited in dairy or pharmaceutical industry in future.

TI  == antibacterial effect of water-soluble chitosan on representative dental pathogens streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli brevis.
AB  == dental caries is still a major oral health problem in most industrialized countries. the development of dental caries primarily involves lactobacilli spp.  and streptococcus mutans. although antibacterial ingredients are used against oral bacteria to reduce dental caries, some reports that show partial antibacterial ingredients could result in side effects. objectives: the main objective is to test the antibacterial effect of water-soluble chitosan while the evaluation of the mouthwash appears as a secondary aim. material and methods: the chitosan was obtained from the application chemistry company (taiwan). the authors investigated the antibacterial effects of water-soluble chitosan against  oral bacteria at different temperatures (25-37 masculinec) and ph values (ph 5-8), and evaluated the antibacterial activities of a self-made water-soluble chitosan-containing mouthwash by in vitro and in vivo experiments, and analyzed the acute toxicity of the mouthwashes. the acute toxicity was analyzed with the pollen tube growth (ptg) test. the growth inhibition values against the logarithmic scale of the test concentrations produced a concentration-response curve. the ic50 value was calculated by interpolation from the data. results: the effect of the ph variation (5-8) on the antibacterial activity of water-soluble chitosan against tested oral bacteria was not significant. the maximal antibacterial activity of water-soluble chitosan occurred at 37 masculinec. the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of water-soluble chitosan on streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli brevis were 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. only 5 s of contact between water-soluble chitosan and oral bacteria attained at least 99.60% antibacterial activity at a concentration  of 500 microg/ml. the water-soluble chitosan-containing mouthwash significantly demonstrated antibacterial activity that was similar to that of commercial mouthwashes (>99.91%) in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. in addition, the  alcohol-free mouthwash exhibited no cytotoxicity and no oral stinging. to the best of our knowledge, this was the first study to combine in vitro and in vivo investigations to analyze the antibacterial properties of water-soluble chitosan-containing mouthwash. conclusions: this study illustrated that water-soluble chitosan may be a viable alternative to commercial mouthwashes in the future.

TI  == antioxidant properties of potentially probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo activities.
AB  == thirty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (seven bifidobacterium, 11 lactobacillus, six lactococcus, and 10 streptococcus thermophilus) were assayed in vitro for antioxidant activity against ascorbic and linolenic acid oxidation (taa(aa) and taa(la)), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac), intracellular glutathione (tgsh), and superoxide dismutase (sod). wide dispersion of each of taa(aa), taa(la), teac, tgsh, and sod occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. the strains bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dsmz 23032, lactobacillus acidophilus dsmz 23033, and lactobacillus brevis dsmz 23034 exhibited among the highest taa(aa), taa(la), teac, and tgsh values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. these  strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. the probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. the analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive oxygen molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts  of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.

TI  == culture-independent detection of microorganisms in traditional slovakian bryndza  cheese.
AB  == in order to investigate the microflora of slovakian bryndza cheese (a cheese containing unpasteurized or pasteurized ewes' milk component) by a culture-independent method, dna was extracted directly from 7 bryndza samples and analysed by an innovative method. using the universal prokaryotic and fungal primers, ribosomal dna internal transcribed spacer (its) regions with variable length were amplified. the standard universal reverse primer l1 aligning to bacterial 23s rdna was found unsuitable for some lactic acid bacteria and other species based on in silico analysis. therefore, l1 primer was replaced by a combination of novel primers gplusr and gminusr aligning to the adjacent, more conserved dna region. the amplification profiles were visualised by both standard electrophoresis and by fluorescent capillary gel electrophoresis. from representative samples, major amplicons were excised from the gel, cloned and sequenced. sequencing revealed that the samples contained lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, streptococcus macedonicus, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, debaromyces hansenii, mucor fragilis, yarrowia lipolytica and galactomyces geotrichum. these results represent an extension of the knowledge on the microflora of slovakian bryndza cheese. the introduced automated ribosomal dna intergenic spacer analysis of the bacterial and fungal genomes proved to be very effective in the application of studying microflora of cheese.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == [comparative clinical efficacy of a probiotic vs. an antibiotic in the treatment  of patients with intestinal bacterial overgrowth and chronic abdominal functional distension: a pilot study].
AB  == introduction: patients with intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) are usually treated with different antibiotics. certain probiotics have proved to be clinically effective in patients with abdominal distension. objective: to compare the short-term clinical efficacy of metronidazol vs. a probiotic in patients with sibo and functional chronic abdominal distension. patients and methods. this was  a randomized prospective pilot study. the study population consisted of 50 patients with chronic abdominal distension (rome iii criteria) and diagnosis of sibo made by a lactulose h2 breath test. patients were consecutively randomized to receive either metronidazol or a probiotic. the metronidazol group consisted of 25 subjects (23 women, median age 49 +/- 19 years old), who received metronidazol (flagyl), 500 mg bid for 5 days. the probiotic group consisted of 25 subjects (20 women, median age 58 +/- 19 years old). the probiotic administered to the latter group contained lactobacillus casei (3.3 x 10(7) ufc), lactobacillus plantarum (3.3 x 10(7) ufc), streptococcus faecalis (3.3 x 10(7) ufc) and bifidobacterium brevis (1.0 x 10(6) ufc) (bioflora) and 5 ml bid were administered for 5 days. both groups went on the same diet, which consisted in reduced consumption of alcohol, legumes, dairy products and leafy green vegetables. response to treatment was assessed by an independent questioner 15 days post treatment. a five-level overall response questionnaire was used. responses included much better, better, the same, worse, and much worse. better and much better were considered positive responses. results: thirteen (52%) subjects receiving metronidazol and 20 (82%) receiving the probiotic referred clinical improvement after the treatment. a statistically significant difference  favoured the use of the probiotic (p = 0.036). all the study patients completed treatment. no adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were observed.  conclusions: based on this pilot study results, we can suggest that the probiotic herein used has a higher efficacy than metronidazol in the early clinical response of patients with chronic abdominal distension and sibo.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of ugandan ghee.
AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

TI  == heme and menaquinone induced electron transport in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == background: for some lactic acid bacteria higher biomass production as a result of aerobic respiration has been reported upon supplementation with heme and menaquinone. in this report, we have studied a large number of species among lactic acid bacteria for the existence of this trait. results: heme- (and menaquinone) stimulated aerobic growth was observed for several species and genera of lactic acid bacteria. these include lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacilllus brevis, lactobacillus paralimentarius, streptococcus entericus and lactococcus garviae. the increased biomass production without further acidification, which are respiration associated traits, are suitable for high-throughput screening as demonstrated by the screening of 8000 lactococcus lactis insertion mutants. respiration-negative insertion-mutants were found with noxa, bd-type cytochrome and menaquinol biosynthesis gene-disruptions. phenotypic screening and in silico genome analysis suggest that respiration can be considered characteristic for certain species. conclusion: we propose that the cyd-genes were present in the common ancestor of lactic acid bacteria, and that multiple gene-loss events best explains the observed distribution of these genes  among the species.

TI  == characterization of four plasmids harboured in a lactobacillus brevis strain encoding a novel bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, and construction of a shuttle vector for lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli.
AB  == in this study we isolated over 250 lactic acid bacteria (lab) candidates from fruit, flowers, vegetables and a fermented food to generate an lab library. one strain, designated 925a, isolated from kimchi (a traditional korean fermented dish made from chinese cabbage) produced a novel type of bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, which is effective against certain lab, including strains of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, bacillus and listeria. strain 925a, identified as lactobacillus brevis, harboured at least four plasmids and we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of each one. the four plasmids were designated plb925a01-04, and have molecular sizes of 1815, 3524, 8881 and 65 037 bp, respectively. we obtained bacteriocin non-producing derivatives by treatment of strain 925a with novobiocin. all of these derivatives, which were susceptible to  their own antibacterial product, lost the largest plasmid, plb925a04, suggesting  that the genes for bacteriocin biosynthesis (breb and brec) and immunity (bree) are located on plb925a04. the partial amino acid sequence of purified brevicin 925a and sequence analysis of plb925a04 showed that breb is the structural gene for brevicin 925a. we constructed a shuttle vector (ples003, 6134 bp) that can replicate in both escherichia coli and lab such as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus hilgardii and enterococcus hirae. to determine the function of gene bree, which displays no significant similarity  to any other sequences in the blast search database, the gene was inserted into ples003. a plb925a04-cured derivative transformed with ples003 carrying bree acquired immunity to brevicin 925a, suggesting that bree encodes an immunity protein.

TI  == microflora of feta cheese from four greek manufacturers.
AB  == the components of the microflora of four feta cheeses, produced by different greek manufacturers, were determined by culture dependent and independent techniques. isolates from microbiological media were first grouped by polymerase  chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and then representatives of each dgge group were sequenced for identification purposes. dna and rna, extracted directly from the cheese, were subjected to pcr-dgge. moreover, feta cheeses were subjected to fish analysis in order to identify viable bacterial populations. the microbial ecology, as represented by the lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeast populations, was different for the four cheeses. the main lab species isolated were lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus coryniformis and lactobacillus fermentum. however, some inconsistencies were observed between the results obtained with the culture dependent and the culture independent approach. in the case of the yeasts, the results obtained by pcr-dgge compared very well with those obtained by the conventional microbiological analysis and the main species found were kluyveromyces lactis, pichia fermentans and c. zeylanoides. fish analysis highlighted viable but not culturable populations of streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus spp. rapd-pcr performed on the l. plantarum isolates revealed a cheese specific distribution and a temperature dependent clustering.

TI  == rapid identification of the three major species of dairy obligate heterofermenters lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus  parabuchneri by species-specific duplex pcr.
AB  == in this study, the biodiversity of 154 strains of lactic acid bacteria, including 112 dairy product isolates presumptively identified as obligately heterofermentative lactobacilli (ohl) by classical microbiological tests, as well as 23 ohl-type strains, was investigated by pcr-based methods and gene sequencing. using these techniques, 51% of the cheese isolates were actually identified as ohl. the non-ohl isolates were identified to the leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weisella, pediococcus or streptococcus genera. among the ohl cheese isolates, five species were directly identified including three of the most frequently isolated species -lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus brevis- and two rarely isolated species - lactobacillus diolivorans and lactobacillus reuteri. a sixth group made up of two dairy isolates was also identified and according to 16s rrna gene and intergenic  spacer region (isr) sequencing data corresponded to lactobacillus sp. and may constitute a new species. species-specific primers were designed for the rapid and reliable detection of the three most frequently isolated species by species-specific duplex pcr.

TI  == a randomized, controlled trial of lactic acid bacteria for idiopathic hyperoxaluria.
AB  == background: urinary oxalate excretion is an important contributor to calcium oxalate stone formation. methods of reducing oxalate excretion are not wholly satisfactory, and no controlled trials using them have been performed to prevent  stone recurrence. some lactic acid bacteria can degrade oxalate in vitro. this study sought to reduce urinary oxalate excretion in calcium stone formers with idiopathic hyperoxaluria. design, setting, participants, and measurements: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed of oxadrop, a mix of four lactic acid bacterium species. this preparation previously reduced oxalate excretion in stone formers with idiopathic and enteric hyperoxaluria. patients were selected from two stone prevention clinics. twenty people with calcium stones and idiopathic hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/d) were enrolled and randomly assigned 1:1 in placebo and active preparation arms. both groups took 3.6 g of granulate each day: either placebo or the experimental preparation. participants  performed two consecutive 24-h urine collections at baseline, at 28 d of therapy, and at 56 d, after being off the preparation for 4 wk. diet was replicated at each point. results: there was no effect of the study preparation: mean 24-h urinary oxalate excretion in placebo-treated patients was 73.9 mg at baseline and 72.7 mg after treatment, whereas the oxadrop-treated patients had 59.1 mg at baseline and 55.4 mg after treatment. the preparation was well tolerated; three participants on active treatment experienced mild constipation. conclusions: in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, oxadrop did not reduce urinary oxalate excretion in participants with idiopathic hyperoxaluria.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == use of a probiotic to decrease enteric hyperoxaluria.
AB  == background: patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states. endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary  oxalate absorption. methods: ten patients were studied with chronic fat malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by  jejunoileal bypass (1) and roux-en-y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4), dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). for 3 months, patients received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (oxadrop), vsl pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and after each month. results: mean urinary oxalate excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, p < 0.05), and oxalate excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, p < 0.05). during the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment. urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. calcium oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on oxadrop, largely due to the decrease in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical significance. conclusion: manipulation of gastrointestinal (gi) flora can influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels. these changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. further studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == apoptotic effects of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria on a human t leukemia cell line are associated with bacterial arginine deiminase and/or sphingomyelinase activities.
AB  == the aim of the present work was, first, to analyze the apoptotic effect in vitro  of sonicated preparations of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria on normal and tumor human lymphocytes. incubation with bacterial samples led to a relevant  time-dependent apoptotic cell death of jurkat cells but not normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. lactobacillus brevis (cd2) samples were more efficient in inducing apoptosis of jurkat cells than were samples of streptococcus thermophilus (s244). in an attempt to characterize the mechanisms underlying these effects, we found that the apoptotic death-inducing ability of s244 preparations could be attributed to the ability of high levels of neutral sphingomyelinase activity to generate relevant amounts of ceramide, a known apoptotic death messenger, in jurkat cells. on the other hand, our results indicate that apoptosis induced by cd2 samples could also be associated with high levels of arginine deiminase activity, which in turn was able to downregulate polyamine synthesis in jurkat cells.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in kefir grains and kefir made from them.
AB  == in an investigation of the changes in the microflora along the pathway: kefir grains (a)-->kefir made from kefir grains (b)-->kefir made from kefir as inoculum (c), the following species of lactic acid bacteria (83-90%) of the microbial count in the grains) were identified: lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and lactobacillus brevis. yeasts (10-17%) identified were kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida inconspicua and candida maris. in  the microbial population of kefir grains and kefir made from them the homofermentative lactic streptococci (52-65% and 79-86%, respectively) predominated. within the group of lactobacilli, the homofermentative thermophilic species l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. helveticus (70-87% of the isolated bacilli) predominated. along the pathway a-->b-->c, the streptococcal proportion in the total kefir microflora increased by 26-30% whereas the lactobacilli decreased by 13-23%. k. marxianus var. lactis was permanently present in kefir grains and kefirs, whereas the dominant lactose-negative yeast in the total yeast flora of the kefir grains dramatically decreased in kefir c.

TI  == evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  == the development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partial 16s rrna genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to streptococcus thermophilus or saccharococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus fermentum. the middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus paracasei, l. fermentum, and lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by dgge during this stage. bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of  residual maltooligosaccharides. by 70 h, two new pcr bands were detected on dgge  gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. the bacteria were phylogenetically related to lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had  previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in japan. these were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as mrs. their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.

TI  == reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB  == background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid  bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis)  for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and  the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange  of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean  levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3  +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation  of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == modulation of colonic barrier function by the composition of the commensal flora  in the rat.
AB  == background and aims: altered intestinal permeability is a key pathogenetic factor of idiopathic bowel inflammation. we investigated in the rat if changes in the composition of the bowel flora can alter colonic permeability. methods: a colonic segment was surgically excluded from faecal transit and brought out as a loop to  the abdominal wall through two colostomies. the loop was used for colonisation with specific bacterial strains after eradication of the native flora with antibiotics. lumen to blood clearance of dextran (molecular weight 70 000) and mannitol (molecular weight 182) was measured in rats recolonised with a single bacterial strain from rat colonic origin, and in control rats whose colonic loop  was kept free of bacteria by antibiotics. actual colonisation was confirmed by culture of segment effluents. results: colonisation with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and streptococcus viridans significantly increased lumen to blood clearance of mannitol. colonisation with lactobacillus brevis had the opposite effect and reduced permeability to mannitol. bacteroides fragilis did not induce significant changes. permeability to dextran was not altered by any of the strains tested. conclusions: certain commensal bacteria can modify colonic wall permeability to luminal substances.

AB  == tyrosine decarboxylase (ec 4.1.1.25) (tdc) from the wine lactobacillus brevis ioeb 9809 was purified by a rapid procedure involving anion exchange chromatography, ultrafiltration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. the protein comprised two subunits of identical molecular mass (approximately 70000 da). enzyme activity was dependent on exogenously supplied pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and the enzyme was stable at 4 degrees c in the presence of the coenzyme. optimum ph for the pure enzyme was 5.0. at this ph, tdc exhibited michaelis-menten kinetics (k(m) 0.63 mm, v(max) 998 units) and was highly substrate-specific for l-tyrosine. other amino acids and l-dopa are not converted by the protein. tyramine acted as a mixed non-competitive inhibitor. significant similarities in  some biochemical properties were observed with the corresponding decarboxylase enzyme of streptococcus faecalis, the sole bacterial tdc described to date.

TI  == on the microbiological profile of traditional portuguese sourdough.
AB  == traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. to this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. more than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via biomerieux api galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. the dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequently isolated yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida pelliculosa. the most frequently isolated lab were (heterofermentative) leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) lactobacillus spp.; l. brevis, l. curvatus, and l. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the lactobacillus genera; lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; enterococcus casseliflavus, e. durans, and e. faecium for enterococci; and streptococcus constellantus and s. equinus for streptococci.

TI  == lactic acid fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima.
AB  == the souring of cassava dough during fermentation into the fermented cassava meal, agbelima, was investigated. four different types of traditional inocula were used to ferment the dough and increases in titrable acidity expressed as lactic acid from 0.31-0.38 to 0.78-0.91% (w/w) confirmed the fermentation to be a process of  acidification. the microflora of all inocula and fermenting dough contained high  counts of lactic acid bacteria, 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g in all inocula and 10(7)-10(8), 10(8)-10(9) and 10(9) cfu/g at 0, 24 and 48 h in all fermentations. lactobacillus plantarum was the dominant species of lactic acid bacteria during all types of fermentation accounting for 51% of 171 representative isolates taken from various stages of fermentation. other major lactic acid bacteria found were lactobacillus brevis, 16%, leuconostoc mesenteroides, 15% and some cocci including streptococcus spp. whose numbers decreased with fermentation time. the lactic acid bacteria were responsible for the souring of agbelima through the production of lactic acid. all l. plantarum, l. brevis and l. mesenteroides isolates examined demonstrated linamarase as well as other enzymatic activities but did not possess tissue degrading enzymes like cellulase, pectin esterase and polygalacturonase. the aroma profile of agbelima did not vary with the type of inoculum used and in all samples the build-up of aroma compounds were dominated by a non-identified low molecular weight alcohol, 1-propanol, isoamyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, 3-methyl-1-butanol and acetoin. substantial reductions occurred in the levels of cyanogenic compounds present in cassava during fermentation into agbelima and detoxification was enhanced by the use of inoculum.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == microflora associated with experimental root surface caries in humans.
AB  == this study describes the microflora from actively progressing root surface caries lesions, in which mineral loss had been determined by quantitative microradiography. the caries lesions were produced experimentally in root surface specimens from human molars inserted in lower partial dentures carried for 3 months by six elderly individuals. a total of 780 bacterial isolates were identified from 13 plaque samples, collected with a punch technique, and six dentin samples. the composition of the microflora showed distinct individual differences. the microflora from plaque samples associated with the highest mineral loss was dominated by either actinomyces viscosus or a combination of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and f) and lactobacillus species (l. casei and l. brevis). plaque from root surfaces with less pronounced mineral loss harbored a more complex microflora comprising gram-positive rods, mutans streptococci, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, veillonella spp., gram-negative rods, and low numbers of lactobacilli. in the latter samples, individual variations in  the proportions of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and g), actinomyces species (a. viscosus and a. naeslundii), and veillonella parvula biotypes were observed. these findings suggest that certain species or combinations of species  are more cariogenic than others and that dominance of single acidogenic species in particular is conducive to high caries activity.

TI  == the effect of ph on the sensitivity of species of lactobacillus to chlorhexidine  and the antibiotics minocycline and spiramycin.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

TI  == the microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  == soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees c underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of ph from 6.5 to  4.5. lactobacillus casei, streptococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter agglomerans, citrobacter diversus and bacillus brevis, and the yeasts pichia burtonii, candida didensiae and rhodotorula rubra.  fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures  of these isolates showed l. casei, strep. faecium and staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the ph reduction. soybeans were the main source  of microorganisms for the fermentation. boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.

TI  == regulation of beta-galactoside transport and accumulation in heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == galactose-grown cells of the heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus buchneri transported methyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (tmg) by an active transport mechanism and accumulated intracellular free tmg when provided with an exogenous source of energy, such as arginine. the intracellular concentration of tmg resultant under  these conditions was approximately 20-fold higher than that in the medium. in contrast, the provision of energy by metabolism of glucose, gluconate, or glucosamine promoted a rapid but transient uptake of tmg followed by efflux that  established a low cellular concentration of the galactoside, i.e., only two- to fourfold higher than that in the medium. furthermore, the addition of glucose to  cells preloaded with tmg in the presence of arginine elicited a rapid efflux of the intracellular galactoside. the extent of cellular tmg displacement and the duration of the transient effect of glucose on tmg transport were related to the  initial concentration of glucose in the medium. exhaustion of glucose from the medium restored uptake and accumulation of tmg, providing arginine was available  for atp generation. the nonmetabolizable sugar 2-deoxyglucose elicited efflux of  tmg from preloaded cells of l. buchneri but not from those of l. brevis. phosphorylation of this glucose analog was catalyzed by cell extracts of l. buchneri but not by those of l. brevis. iodoacetate, at a concentration that inhibits growth and atp production from glucose, did not prevent efflux of cellular tmg elicited by glucose. the results suggested that a phosphorylated metabolite(s) at or above the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate was required to evoke displacement of intracellular tmg from the cells. counterflow experiments suggested that glucose converted the active uptake of tmg in l. brevis to a facilitated diffusion mechanism that allowed equilibrium of tmg between the extra- and intracellular milieux. the means by which glucose metabolites elicited this vectorial regulation is not known, but similarities to the inducer expulsion that has been described for homofermentative streptococcus and lactobacillus species suggested the involvement of hpr, a protein that functions as a phosphocarrier protein in the phosphotransferase system, as well as a presumptive regulator of sugar transport. indeed, complementation assays wit extracts of staphylococcus aureus ptsh mutant revealed the presence of hpr in l. brevis, although this lactobacillus lacked a functional phaosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphortransferase system for glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, or tmg.

AB  == various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (tk; ec 2.7.1.21). taking the specific tk activity of escherichia coli k12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific tk activities. in the gram-positive cocci, staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of strep. pyogenes (29%). neisseria sicca, a gram-negative coccus, lacked tk. gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (bacillus, 13-51%; clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of b. megaterium (2%) and c. difficile (1-3%). among the gram-positive asporogenous rods, listeria monocytogenes and six species of lactobacillus (especially l. brevis, l. buchneri and l. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. lactis and l. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). of the species of pseudomonas studied, most  lacked tk but ps. fluorescens and ps. maltophilia had significant tk activity (15-53%). of the gram-negative facultative anaerobes, vibrio lacked tk, while enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella (148-1120%), escherichia (59-141%), klebsiella (78-299%) and serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'pr. rettgerella' (307%). propionibacterium and bifidobacterium and related organisms other than streptomyces, nocardia, rhodococcus, corynebacterium and mycobacterium lacked tk. the seven species of candida tested, and cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked tk.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [spoilage microorganisms encountered in ultra-high temperature processed milk].
AB  == 40 strains of aerobic or facultative anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from  a total of 37 spoiled ultra high temperature processed milk. 13 of them were identified as the genus bacillus. they were 6 b. cereus, 5 b. licheniformis, 1 b. brevis and 1 b. pumilus. the other 27 strains were nonsporeforming microorganisms, which included 5 yeasts, 2 pseudomonas sp., 3 streptococcus sp.,  12 lactobacillus sp., 1 shigella sp., 1 aeromonas sp. and 3 micrococcus sp. results indicate that the spoilage of milk sample was caused mainly by the contamination during the filling operation. the bacillus strains isolated were mesophilic or thermophilic, and some of them, were also psychrotrophic.

TI  == distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  == the gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. a colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides vulgatus, enterobacter aerogenes, and a fusobacterium sp. was established. these gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. except for the presence of large numbers of bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of s. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism  in conventional gerbils. microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic  gerbils were similar. histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  == degradation of organic acids by dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == one hundred and twelve different strains of lactic acid bacteria, belonging to the genera leuconostoc, streptococcus, and lactobacillus, were examined for the ability to degrade 10 organic acids by detecting gas production, using the conventional durham tube method. all the strains did not break down succinate, glutarate, 2-oxo-glutarate, and mucate. malate, citrate, pyruvate, fumarate, tartrate, and gluconate were variably attacked. streptococcus cremoiris am2, ml8, and sk11 required glucose to produce gas from citrate, whereas leuconostoc citrovorum and streptococcus faecalis did not. streptococcus cremoris differed from the other streptococci in not producing gas from gluconate. from all lactic  acid bacteria examined, only lactobacillus plantarum formed gas from tartarate. determination of acetoin and diacetyl proved to be a more reliable evidence for assessing the degradation of pyruvate, compared with detection of gas production. homofermentative lactobacilli and leuconostoc citrovorum produced acetoin and diacetyl from pyruvate, whereas beta-bacteria did not, a character that would be  of taxonomic value. streptobacteria degraded pyruvate in the presence of glucose  with lactate as the major product together with a mean acetate of 4.1%, ethanol 7.9%, acetoin 1.7%, and diacetyl 2.6% yield on a molar basis after 60 days at 30  degrees c. l. brevis produced acetate and lactate. formation of diacetyl from pyruvate by lactic acid bacteria may play an important role in flavour development in fermenting dairy products, especially in cheese, where lactic acid bacteria usually predominate, and pyruvate is probably excreted in the breaking down of lactose and in the oxidative deamination of alanine by the accompanying microflora.

TI  == a new hydrolase specific for taurine-conjugates of bile acids.
AB  == through the investigation of the bile acid-deconjugation activities of human intestinal anaerobes, a new enzyme was discovered in peptostreptococcus intermedius which hydrolyzed specifically the taurine-conjugates, but not the glycine-conjugates of bile acids. however, the enzymes in streptococcus faecalis  and lactobacillus brevis hydrolyzed chiefly the glycine-conjugates.

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == sequence characterization of 5s ribosomal rna from eight gram positive procaryotes.
AB  == the available comparative data on procaryotic 5s rrna was extended through sequencing studies of eight gram positive procaryotes. complete nucleotide sequences were presented for 5s rrna from bacillus subtilis, b. firmus, b. pasteurii, b. brevis, lactobacillus brevis and streptococcus faecalis. in addition, 5s rrna oligonucleotide catalogs and partial sequence data were provided for b. cereus and sporosarcina ureae. these sequences and catalogs were  discussed in terms of known features of procaryotic 5s rrna architecture.

TI  == biosynthesis of diacetyl in bacteria and yeast.
AB  == both diacetyl and acetoin were produced by cell-free extracts and cultures of pseudomonas fluorescens, aerobacter aerogenes, lactobacillus brevis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae 299, whereas only acetoin was produced by cell-free extracts and cultures of streptococcus lactis, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, and s. cerevisiae strains 513 and 522. cell-free extracts that produced diacetyl did not produce it from acetoin; they produced it from pyruvate, but only if acetyl-coenzyme a was was added to the reaction mixtures. production of diacetyl by s. cerevisiae 299 was prevented by valine, inhibited by sodium arsenite, and stimulated by pantothenic acid. valine did not prevent the production of acetoin. e. coli and the three strains of s. cerevisiae did not decarboxylate alpha-acetolactate but did use acetaldehyde in the production of acetoin from pyruvate. the other organisms produced acetoin from pyruvate via alpha-acetolactate.

TI  == effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth (bbl). some of the effectors, e.g., streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, lactobacillus lactis, l. brevis, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of s. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most  cultures were inhibitory, and some (s. faecium and l. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the staphylococcus. low-temperature meat lactobacilli and leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited s. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 c throughout its growth. streptococcus  faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 c, as well. when the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat lactobacillus, and l. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 c, and all but the meat lactobacillus did so at 22 c. a ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 c, except that s. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by s. faecalis. a ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. in general, the more effector bacteria there were  in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of s. aureus. inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 c, less so at 20 or 25 c, and least at 30 or 37 c, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of s. aureus were similar, for the most part.
