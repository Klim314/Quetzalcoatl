TI  == development of antimicrobial resistance in the normal anaerobic microbiota during one year after administration of clindamycin or ciprofloxacin.
AB  == thirty healthy subjects (15 males and 15 females) were randomly assigned in three groups and clindamycin (150 mg qid) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg bid) or placebo was  given for a 10-day period. skin, nasal, saliva, faeces samples were collected at  day - 1, day 11, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months and 12 months post administration for microbiological analysis. ciprofloxacin or clindamycin had no impact on the anaerobic skin microbiota and the proportions of antibiotic resistant anaerobic bacteria were similar as in the placebo group. ciprofloxacin had impact on the propionibacterium acnes in the nasal microbiota that normalized after 1 month, however, ciprofloxacin-resistant p. acnes strains increased at month 2 and month  12. clindamycin had no impact on the nasal microbiota. in the oropharyngeal microbiota, a higher proportion of ciprofloxacin resistant veillonella was found, it lasting up to 12 months post dosing. in the clindamycin group, clindamycin-resistant prevotella spp. were found in increased proportions compared to placebo at various time points except month 4 in the saliva samples.  the relative proportion of ciprofloxacin-resistant bifidobacteria increased in the faecal samples on day 11, 1 month, 4 months and 12 months post dosing compared to placebo. the proportion of clindamycin-resistant bacteroides spp. increased at 1, 2, 4 and 12 months post dosing compared to placebo in the faecal  samples. no clostridium difficile was recovered from any of the samples from any  of the volunteers at any visit. the concentrations of ciprofloxacin or clindamycin in the faeces were higher than the mics for most of the organisms present in the normal microbiota. no obvious correlation between the groups in resistant patterns for anaerobic bacteria was observed. in conclusion, based on the microbiological data of the microbiota as well as the results of the bioassays for ciprofloxacin and clindamycin concentrations in the faecal samples, oral administration of ciprofloxacin and clindamycin has an impact on the anaerobic microbiota and may have a long-term effect on the development and persistence of antibiotic-resistant anaerobes in the normal microbiota.

TI  == advancement in the routine identification of anaerobic bacteria by maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == we evaluated matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) biotyper as a tool for the identification of anaerobic bacteria compared with 500 base-pair (bp) 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) gene sequencing analysis, which is considered to be the "gold standard" method. a total of 484 anaerobic bacteria were retrieved from the clinical specimens of 318 pediatric patients. molecular identification resulted in 18 genera and 51 species. the most prevalent genus was clostridium (76.85 %),  with 70 % c. difficile isolates. the concordance and sensitivity determined by maldi-tof ms for c. difficile, the most prevalent species isolated, was 94.08 %,  whereas the specificity was 100 %. for the other anaerobes, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.07 % and 81.82 %, respectively, with a concordance of 93.15 %. low performance was observed for propionibacterium acnes and fusobacterium nucleatum, for which a dedicated pretreatment procedure should likely be set up.  maldi-tof ms was shown to be a valid alternative for the fast and reliable identification of the most clinically relevant anaerobic bacteria; moreover, it is less time-consuming, the cost for reagents is minimized, and it does not require dedicated personnel.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == in vitro activity against anaerobes of retapamulin, a new topical antibiotic for  treatment of skin infections.
AB  == objectives: retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated  as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. methods: the in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. mics were determined by the clsi reference agar  dilution method (m11-a6). results: ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the bacteroides fragilis group. despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the b. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/l or less. all the investigated strains of clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/l retapamulin. three strains of c. difficile and one strain of c. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by <or=2 mg/l. conclusions: at <or=2 mg/l, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. the  broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive. pending further clinical investigation, retapamulin may offer an alternative treatment for anaerobic skin infections in this era of increasing resistance.

TI  == [the study of the pro-nucleating activity of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones in model bile systems].
AB  == objective: to explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. methods: observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (nt). results: (1) model bile were suitable for the growth of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and clostridium. propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) with  pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. conclusions: pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.

TI  == the effect of carbon dioxide on the in vitro activity of erythromycin and ru-28965 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of erythromycin and ru-28965 (a novel macrolide antimicrobial with improved pharmacokinetics) was determined against a variety of anaerobic bacteria in anaerobic atmospheres with and without added carbon dioxide. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in wilkins-chalgren agar (oxoid, uk) containing saponinlysed horse blood to a final concentration of 10%. the inoculum used was approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters wilkins-chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar  plates using a multipoint inoculator. following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic atmosphere containing 10% carbon dioxide or in hydrogen alone. the mic of each antimicrobial for each organism examined was determined as the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial which completely inhibited growth of the inoculum. the minimum concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 50% (mic50) and 90% (mic90) of the bacteria examined were also determined. the mics of erythromycin and ru-28965 for isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group, b. bivius and fusobacterium spp. were generally 10-100 times greater when determined in the presence of carbon dioxide  than when determined in hydrogen alone. the mics of erythromycin and ru-28965 for b. melaninogenicus, peptococcus spp., peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium perfringens, cl. difficile and propionibacterium acnes were less affected by the  presence of carbon dioxide.

AB  == the in vitro activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antimicrobial, was determined against a total of 286 anaerobic bacteria including bacteroides fragilis group (100), b. melaninogenicus (21), b. bivius (16), fusobacterium spp. (15), peptococcus spp. (20), peptostreptococcus spp. (21), clostridium perfringens (23), c. difficile (41) and propionibacterium acnes (29). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in wilkins-chalgren agar approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters wilkins-chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar plates using a multipoint inoculator. following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic atmosphere. both vancomycin and teicoplanin were highly active against  all the gram-positive anaerobic bacteria examined, 90% of all isolates being inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml of either antimicrobial. isolates of b. fragilis group and fusobacterium spp. were resistant to vancomycin (mic90 64 micrograms/ml) and teicoplanin (mic90 128 micrograms/ml). unexpectedly, isolates  of b. melaninogenicus and b. bivius which were resistant to vancomycin (mic90 64  and 128 micrograms/ml respectively) were sensitive to teicoplanin (mic90 2 and 2  micrograms/ml respectively).

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in sweden in 1983.
AB  == this review is concerned with anaerobic bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility. data on the susceptibility to different antimicrobials of anaerobic isolates in sweden during 1983 is presented. among the different bacterial groups, clostridium perfringens, propionibacteria, anaerobic cocci and  curved rods were found to be susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin  and chloramphenicol. c. difficile was susceptible to benzylpenicillin and imipenem, but resistant to cefoxitin. most c. difficile strains were also susceptible to clindamycin and fusidic acid, while all strains were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. the majority of the fusobacteria were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. however, some strains were found to be resistant to penicillins. against the bacteroides fragilis group, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole and imipenem had the best activity, whereas piperacillin and cefoxitin showed good activities. most bacteroides non-fragilis strains were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. however, an increasing number of isolates were found to be resistant especially to penicillins when comparing with data from the last five years.

TI  == teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  == teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and gram-positive anaerobes (propionibacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens and cl. difficile). ninety per cent of the staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for str.  faecalis. in mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. it was very effective in curing experimental mouse  septicemias caused by gram-positive bacteria (ed50 values less than 1 mg/kg).
