antimicrobial protein produced by vaginal lactobacillus acidophilus that inhibits gardnerella vaginalis.
objective: to isolate bacteriocin from a vaginal strain of lactobacillus acidophilus. methods: l. acidophilus 160 was grown on two media. the first was mrs broth for 18 hours; the cells were harvested, washed, and placed into a chemically defined medium. the second medium resembled vaginal fluid minus protein. bacteriocin was precipitated from both media using ammonium sulfate. the growth-inhibiting activity of bacteriocin was determined by a bioassay using nine different isolates of gardnerella vaginalis. results: mrs broth is not a suitable medium for extracting bacteriocin, because it binds with tween 80. bacteriocin was isolated, without contaminating constituents, from chemically defined medium and identified as a single band by electrophoresis. bacteriocin has a molecular weight of 3.8 kda. all nine isolates of gardnerella were inhibited by the bacteriocin isolated from l. acidophilus 160. conclusions: bacteriocin produced by l. acidophilus 160 was isolated from the chemically defined medium (starvation medium) in a partially pure form. l. acidophilus 160 bacteriocin inhibited growth of all nine isolates of gardnerella vaginalis.
