TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == association of a novel high molecular weight, serine-rich protein (srpa) with fibril-mediated adhesion of the oral biofilm bacterium streptococcus cristatus.
AB  == the surface of the oral plaque bacterium streptococcus cristatus is decorated with a lateral tuft of fibrils. the fibrillar tuft functions in the adhesion of s. cristatus to heterologous bacterial species in the plaque biofilm. the tuft typically consists of a densely packed fringe of shorter fibrils 238 +/- 19 nm long with longer, less abundant fibrils 403 +/- 66 nm long projecting through the fringe of short fibrils. the two types of fibrils in the tufts of s. cristatus have been refractory to biochemical separation, complicating their characterization. a hexadecane partition assay was used to enrich for subpopulations of s. cristatus cr311 (type strain nctc 12479) having distinct fibrillar morphotypes. negative staining in the tem revealed that cells of a hydrophobic subpopulation of s. cristatus (cr311var1) carried only the long fibrils (395 +/- 32 nm). a hydrophilic subpopulation of s. cristatus (cr311var3)  consisted of mixed morphotypes having no fibrils or remnant short fibrils (223 +/- 49 nm). no long fibrils were observed on any cells in the cr311var3 subpopulation. the cr311var3 morphotype, unlike the wild-type strain and cr311var1, was not able to form corncobs with either corynebacterium matruchotii  or fusobacterium nucleatum. variant cr311var3 did not express the novel gene srpa, which encodes a high molecular weight (321,882 da) serine-rich protein, srpa. the srpa protein contains two extensive repeat motifs of 17 and 71 amino acids and a gram-positive cell wall anchor consensus sequence (lpntg). the unusual properties of srpa most closely resemble those of fap1, the fimbrial-associated adhesin protein of streptococcus parasanguis. the association of long fibrils, high surface hydrophobicity, ability to form corncob formations, and expression of the srpa gene suggest that srpa is a long fibril protein in s.  cristatus.
