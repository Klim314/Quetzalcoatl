TI  - Influence of the Periodontal Status on the Initial-Biofilm Formation on Titanium  Surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. The bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (Ti) surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study. The subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed Ti surfaces for 48 hours. Microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each Ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: Despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the Ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each of the study groups. However, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the Ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. Treponema denticola, Neisseria mucosa, Eikenella corrodens, and Tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the Ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions of Capnocytophaga sputigena, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Streptococcus mitis were detected on the Ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize Ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the Ti implant.
TI  - Discovery of beta-1,4-D-mannosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine phosphorylase involved in the metabolism of N-glycans.
AB  - A gene cluster involved in N-glycan metabolism was identified in the genome of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482. This gene cluster encodes a major facilitator superfamily transporter, a starch utilization system-like transporter consisting of a TonB-dependent oligosaccharide transporter and an outer membrane lipoprotein, four glycoside hydrolases (alpha-mannosidase, beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase, exo-alpha-sialidase, and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase), and a phosphorylase (BT1033) with unknown function. It was demonstrated that BT1033 catalyzed the reversible phosphorolysis of beta-1,4-D-mannosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in a typical sequential Bi Bi mechanism. These results indicate that BT1033 plays a crucial role as a key enzyme in the N-glycan catabolism where beta-1,4-D-mannosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine is liberated from N-glycans by sequential glycoside hydrolase-catalyzed reactions, transported into the cell, and intracellularly converted into alpha-D-mannose 1-phosphate and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. In addition, intestinal anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides helcogenes, Bacteroides salanitronis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella dentalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Parabacteroides distasonis, and Alistipes finegoldii were also suggested to possess the similar metabolic pathway for N-glycans. A notable feature of the new metabolic pathway for N-glycans is the more efficient use of ATP-stored energy, in comparison with the conventional pathway where beta-mannosidase and ATP-dependent hexokinase participate, because it is possible to directly phosphorylate the D-mannose residue of beta-1,4-D-mannosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine to enter glycolysis. This is the first report of a metabolic pathway for N-glycans that includes a phosphorylase. We propose 4-O-beta-D-mannopyranosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:phosphate alpha-D-mannosyltransferase as the systematic name and beta-1,4-D-mannosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine phosphorylase as the short name for BT1033.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. METHOD: Thirty IBD patients [15 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. All patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. From every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. Samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis using a checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. RESULTS: Multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for Bacteroides ureolyticus, Campylobacter gracilis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Treponema denticola (P<0.001). CD patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than UC patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (P<0.05). CD patients harbored higher levels of P. melaninogenica, S. aureus, S. anginosus, and S. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (P<0.05). UC patients harbored higher levels of S. aureus (P=0.01) and P. anaerobius (P=0.05) than controls only in gingivitis sites. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, IBD patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.
TI  - The short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects was performed. Bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: No halitosis (identified by VSC assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone, in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. At day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, Fusobacterium sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Tannerella forsythia. A decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: P. gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, S. aureus, and Treponema denticola. Baseline VSC scores were correlated with several bacterial species. The use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of VSC compared to rinsing alone. CONCLUSIONS: VSC scores were not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. The active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. Tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.
TI  - Necrotizing periodontal diseases in HIV-infected Brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From a pool of 1,232 HIV-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. Subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. The presence and levels of 47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: All 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. Thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). Regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). The frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. Species detected in high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included Treponema denticola, Eikenella corrodens, Dialister pneumosintes, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus intermedius, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter rectus. In contrast, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium nodatum, and Helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. CONCLUSION: Necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in HIV-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular T denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as E faecalis and D pneumosintes. In addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and AIDS-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.
TI  - The microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. METHODS: Microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the Dental School of the University of Athens, who were split into three age groups. A total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: All of the test species, except Parvimonas micra and Porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial profiles for the different oral surfaces. Supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of Actinomyces species and Green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the Yellow complex. The profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. Many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. Periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. Specifically, the Red complex species (Tannerella forsythia, P. gingivalis, Treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (P < 0.05) in all sample locations. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. Differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of Orange and Red complex species.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Tinidazole inhibitory and cidal activity against anaerobic periodontal pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tinidazole against anaerobic periodontal pathogens (25 Prevotella buccae, 18 Prevotella denticola, 10 Prevotella intermedia, 6 Prevotella melaninogenica, 5 Prevotella oralis, 10 Fusobacterium nucleatum and 8 Veillonella spp.) was determined by agar dilution. MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) were 8 microg/mL for Veillonella spp., 4 microg/mL for P. intermedia, 2 microg/mL for P. buccae, 1 microg/mL for Fusobacterium spp. and 0.5 microg/mL for other Prevotella spp. Cidal activity was studied by killing curves with tinidazole and amoxicillin (alone and in combination) at concentrations similar to those achieved in crevicular fluid (41.2 microg/mL tinidazole and 14.05 microg/mL amoxicillin) against an inoculum of ca. 10(7)colony-forming units/mL of four bacterial groups, each one composed of four different strains of the following periodontal isolates: Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Veillonella spp. (anaerobes) and one amoxicillin-susceptible Streptococcus spp. (facultative) in a proportion of 1:1:1:1. When only beta-lactamase-negative Prevotella or Fusobacterium strains were tested, significantly higher reductions were found with amoxicillin (>4 log reduction at 48 h) versus controls. The presence of beta-lactamase-positive Prevotella spp. or F. nucleatum strains rendered amoxicillin inactive (no reductions at 48 h), with no differences from controls. Amoxicillin+tinidazole produced >3 log reduction at 24h and >4 log reduction at 48 h regardless of the presence or not of beta-lactamase-positive strains. The presence in crevicular fluid of beta-lactamases produced by beta-lactamase-positive periodontal pathogens may have ecological and therapeutic consequences since it may protect beta-lactamase-negative periodontal pathogens from amoxicillin treatment. In vitro, tinidazole offered high antianaerobic activity against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative periodontal pathogens, avoiding amoxicillin inactivation.
TI  - Periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type I: report of three cases within a family.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentin dysplasia type I (DDI) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. It is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (PAL). In this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of DDI but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. METHODS: A 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of DDI. Probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. Subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The mother presented 34.9% of sites with PD > or =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with CAL > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with BOP; both daughters presented no sites with PD or CAL >3 mm and <10% of sites with BOP. Microbiologic analysis detected Gemella morbillorum, Neisseria mucosa, and Staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. The daughters showed high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (Porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (Fusobacterium periodonticum and F. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (Streptococcus gordonii) and purple (Veillonella parvula) complexes. The mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (N. mucosa, Prevotella melaninogenica, Treponema denticola, and V. parvula). CONCLUSION: A combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid PAL and to provide oral health in patients with DDI.
TI  - PCR-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using PCR method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. The presence of selected pathogens (Actinomyces israelii, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Tannerella forsythensis, Enterococcus faecium, Prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using PCR. RESULTS: T. denticola (P = .012, .02) and E. faecalis (P = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while P. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (P = .01, .015). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
TI  - Rapid identification of non-sporing anaerobes using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and an identification strategy.
AB  - PURPOSE: The non-sporing anaerobes cause a wide spectrum of infections. They are  difficult to culture and their identification is tedious and time-consuming. Rapid identification of anaerobes is highly desirable. Towards this end, the potential of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for providing a fingerprint within the proton spectrum of six genera belonging to anaerobes reflecting their characteristic metabolites has been investigated. METHODS: NMR analysis was carried out using Mercury plus Varian 300 MHz (7.05 T) NMR spectrophotometer on six different anaerobes. These included Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella denticola, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Peptococcus niger and Peptostreptococcus spp. After the NMR analysis (256/512 scans), the different peaks were noted. The eight pus specimens, which yielded pure culture of anaerobe, also were analysed similarly. RESULTS: The major resonances of multiplex of amino acids/lipid at 0.9 ppm along with lactate/lipid at 1.3 ppm, acetate at 1.92 ppm and multiplex of lysine at 3.0 ppm remained constant to label the organism as an anaerobe. There was a difference found in the MR spectra of different genera and species. A simple algorithm was developed for the identification of the six different anaerobes studied. The MR spectra of the pure culture of the organism matched the MR spectra of pus from which the organism was isolated. CONCLUSIONS: MR-based identification was of value in the identification of anaerobes. However, a larger database of the peaks produced by anaerobes needs to be created for identification of all genera and species. It could then have the potential of diagnosing an anaerobic infection in vivo and thus expedite management of deep-seated abscesses.
TI  - Odontogenic bacteria in periodontal disease and resistance patterns to common antibiotics used as treatment and prophylaxis in odontology in Spain.
AB  - Resistance in streptococci or Gram-negative bacteria is associated with antibiotic consumption. Scarce information exists on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with periodontitis in countries with high antibiotic consumption, as this is an area in which microbiological testing is not performed in daily practice. The present study was undertaken to explore the susceptibility of bacterial isolates in periodontitis to antibiotics prescribed in odontology in Spain as treatment for local infections or prophylaxis for distant focal infections. Periodontal samples were prospectively collected in 48 patients classified by pocket depth of <4 mm and >or=4 mm. Species were identified by culture, selecting the five most frequent morphotypes per sample, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Susceptibility was determined by E-test. A total of 261 isolates were identified: 72.9% patients had Streptococcus oralis; 70.8% Streptococcus mitis; 60.4% Prevotella buccae; 39.6% Prevotella denticola; 37.5% Fusobacterium nucleatum; 35.4% Prevotella intermedia; 25% Capnocytophaga spp.; 23% Veillonella spp.; 22.9% Prevotella melaninogenica and Streptococcus sanguis; and <20% other species. Streptococcus viridans resistance rates were 0% for amoxicillin, approximately 10% for clindamycin, 9-22% for tetracycline, and for azithromycin ranged from 18.2% for S. sanguis to 47.7% for S. mitis. Prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with amoxicillin resistance ranging from 17.1% in P. buccae to 26.3% in P. denticola. Metronidazole resistance was <6% in all Prevotella species, while clindamycin resistance ranged from 0 to 21.1%. beta-Lactamase production was positive in 54.1% Prevotella spp., 38.9% F. nucleatum, 30% Capnocytophaga spp., and 10% Veillonella spp. In this study, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most active antibiotic against all species tested, followed by metronidazole in the case of anaerobes.
TI  - Microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. METHODS: Ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. Subsequently, a period of 21 days of washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. Microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: The species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were Prevotella melaninogenica and Veillonella parvula. The mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). Proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSION: The tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.
TI  - [Prevotella species involved in the onset of superficial face and neck abscesses].
AB  - The aim of the study was to identify at species level the Prevotella strains from 30 pus samples collected by needle aspiration in patients with abscesses of fascial spaces of the face and neck. Microscopy of Gram-stained direct smear and cultures on selective and nonselective media incubated aerobically and anaerobically were performed in each pus specimen. All strains of Gram-negative strictly anaerobic bacilli were identified to genus and species level using conventional methods of diagnosis and the Rapid ID 32 A system (BioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). The Prevotella isolates were recovered (alone or in association with other bacteria) in 46.6% of the investigated specimens and were represented in reverse order of frequency by the following species: P. melaninogenica, P. denticola, P. oralis and P. loescheii. In conclusion, the rate of Prevotella isolation was relatively high and the most frequently isolated species was P. melaninogenica (followed by P. denticola), while no P. intermedia was found.
TI  - Proteinase activity of prevotella species associated with oral purulent infection.
AB  - Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens are often regarded as principal causes of acute dentoalveolar infection; however, other species within the genus are also known to be associated with such infection. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro proteolytic activity of these different Prevotella species that have been implicated with dentoalveolar infection. A total of 234 strains were obtained from pus specimens from dentoalveolar infection and from the plaque of healthy volunteers. Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella oralis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella buccae, and Prevotella denticola were all shown to have a proteolytic activity (8.5-10.5 x 10(-8) A-units) lower than that of P. intermedia and P. nigrescens (21.1-23.5 x 10(-8) A-units). In the case of P. loescheii, P. melaninogenica, and P. intermedia, the level of proteolytic activity for clinical strains was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that recorded for commensal strains. Proteolytic activity for all species of Prevotella examined was inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide and phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride. This study suggests that Prevotella species associated with oral purulent infection produce cysteine and serine proteinases and that in certain species of Prevotella, the strains involved in infection exhibit higher proteolytic activity when compared with strains from healthy sites.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates of prevotella and porphyromonas species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study determined the beta-lactamase production and the antimicrobial resistance of 72 Prevotella species and 48 Porphyromonas species isolated from different clinical specimens. METHODS: All strains were identified using API 32 ID. The beta-lactamase production was determined by nitrocefin disks. E test strips of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cefoxitin, clindamycin, metronidazole and imipenem were tested for each strain. RESULTS: Nineteen Prevotella melaninogenica, 18 Prevotella intermedia, 16 Prevotella denticola, 11 Prevotella loescheii and 8 Prevotella bivia strains were identified. Four were clindamycin resistant. The highest beta-lactamase production was found at a rate of 68.4% in P. melaninogenica species. Additionally, 33 Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and 15 Porphyromonas gingivalis strains were identified. None of them produced beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: In view of the emerging antibiotic resistance among anaerobes, the current local susceptibility profile of our Prevotella and Porphyromonas species will establish the basis for additional surveys tracing significant changes in the antimicrobial resistance of our clinical isolates.
TI  - Susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  - Since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (PMC) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. Both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola and Prevotella melaninogenica. The MIC of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the MIC of PMC from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. The highest MIC value of PMC was detected for E. faecalis whereas E. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. The highest MIC values of chlorhexidine were observed for P. aeruginosa whereas E. coli and P. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. Since the MIC values observed are much lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis subjects from different geographic locations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most clinical studies assume that the subgingival microbiota is similar from one geographic location to another. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in chronic periodontitis subjects from four countries. METHOD: Subjects with chronic periodontitis (N, Sweden=101; USA=115; Brazil=58; Chile=26) were recruited. Subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing (BOP), suppuration, pocket depth (PD) and attachment level (AL) at six sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples=6036). % DNA probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. Significance of differences in proportions of each species among countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p-Values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: On average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in the four countries. Thirteen species differed significantly in adjusted mean proportions among countries even after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Porphyromonas gingivalis, one species that differed in proportions among countries, comprised adjusted means of 7.5, 11.9, 1.6 and 6.6% of the microbiota in subjects from Brazil, Chile, Sweden and USA (p<0.001), while mean proportions of Treponema denticola were 6.7, 4.2, 0.8 and 2.3, respectively (p<0.001). In contrast, a key periodontal pathogen, Tannerella forsythensis, exhibited mean proportions ranging from 6.2-8.5% and did not differ significantly among countries. Besides these species, prominent species in Brazil were Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 (8.4%, 7.2%) and Prevotella intermedia (6.5%); in Chile, Prevotella melaninogenica (6.4%) and Neisseria mucosa (5.3%); in Sweden A. naeslundii genospecies 2 (8.4%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (7.1%) and Peptostreptococcus micros (5.0%); in USA A. naeslundii genospecies 2 (7.5%), P. intermedia (6.8%) and C. gingivalis (6.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from chronic periodontitis subjects in four countries showed surprisingly marked differences. These differences persisted after adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid ID 32A system for identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Rapid ID 32A system (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) for the identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group. METHODS: Five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-B. fragilis group anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were tested in the Rapid ID 32A system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The Rapid ID 32A system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. A further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by the manufacturer. Fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. Three isolates of Prevotella were not identified by the system. Of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: The Rapid ID 32A system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-B. fragilis group, anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. There was poor discrimination between Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum, between Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis, and between Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella oralis. The need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.
TI  - "Checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum IgG responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). Smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject; 2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic DNA probes. Serum IgG antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. RESULTS: Cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. Corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. Heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). Higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Eubacterium nodatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula, and Actinomyces naeslundii in controls. Cases displayed higher IgG levels against P. gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against F. nucleatum, T. denticola, E. nodatum, and Capnocytophaga ochracea. Positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. In cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species out of which only one was positive (V. parvula). Both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. A logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. Smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. CONCLUSION: A combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.
TI  - Genetic relationships within the genus Prevotella analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - The genetic diversity and relationships within the genus Prevotella were studied  by analyzing twenty-five strains by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) at nine metabolic enzyme loci and DNA-DNA hybridization. MLEE revealed a high genetic diversity with 25 electrophoretic types (ETs) for the 25 strains studied, a mean number of alleles per enzyme locus of 6.8 and a mean genetic diversity per locus of 0.786. The index of association described by Maynard Smith et al. (1993) revealed a clonal structure within the genus Prevotella. A dendrogram generated by cluster analysis of a matrix of ETs showed that species like P. bivia, P. buccae, P. oris, P. oralis, P. nigrescens, and P. denticola form clusters that are consistent with DNA homologies. However, strains identified as P. melaninogenica or P. loescheii by DNA-DNA hybridization did not constitute distinct subpopulations in MLEE. MLEE analysis demonstrated its high power in differentiating closely related strains. It provides an alternative to 16S rRNA analysis for the study of phylogenetic relationships within the genus Prevotella, especially for differentiating strains with high DNA homology or high rRNA homology.
TI  - Isolation and speciation of Prevotella strains from periodontal abscesses.
AB  - The aims of the study were to isolate and to identify at species level the Prevotella strains in pus samples collected by needle aspiration from 25 Romanian patients with periodontal abscesses. Gram-stained smears and cultures on selective and nonselective media were performed from each of the 25 pus samples. The isolates were identified on the basis of Gram staining, cultural characteristics and standard biochemical reactions. The Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli isolates were biochemically characterized and identified at species level using the Rapid ID 32 A system (Bio Merieux, France). Fifteen Prevotella isolates belonging to one of the following species: P. melaninogenica, P. denticola, P. oralis, P. loescheii and P. bivia were recovered. All Prevotella isolates reacted similarly in 20 tests in the Rapid ID 32 A system. The P. melaninogenica strain showed approximately the same biochemical profile and only two sugar fermentation tests were not constantly positive. The study confirmed that Prevotella is often involved in periodontal abscesses (> 50% of the cases) in association with other anaerobic or/and aerobic bacteria. P. melaninogenica was the most frequently isolated Prevotella species from the investigated cases.
TI  - beta-lactamase production by oral pigmented Prevotella species isolated from young children.
AB  - The frequency of beta-lactamase production by oral pigmented Prevotella species isolated from 23 healthy young children and the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 186 available beta-lactamase-positive isolates were examined by using the chromogenic cephalosporin disk test (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) and the Etest (AB BIODISK) and/or the agar dilution method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (Villanova, PA, USA), respectively. beta-Lactamase-positive Prevotella melaninogenica strains were isolated from all children, and more than two-thirds of the Prevotella denticola and Prevotella loescheii strains isolated from the children were beta-lactamase-positive. The beta-lactamase-producing Prevotella intermedia group consisted of Prevotella nigrescens and the P. intermedia/ P. nigrescens-like organism (PINLO); P. intermedia was not found. Only two P. nigrescens isolates but most of the PINLO isolates produced beta-lactamase. The MICs for beta-lactamase-producing strains varied between 0.38 and 64 micrograms/mL. beta-Lactamase production by oral pigmented Prevotella species colonizing young children is already frequent. The phenomenon should be taken into account in the treatment of pediatric anaerobic infections of oral origin.
TI  - Inhibition of Prevotella and Capnocytophaga immunoglobulin A1 proteases by human  serum.
AB  - Oral Prevotella and Capnocytophaga species, regularly isolated from periodontal pockets and associated with extraoral infections, secret specific immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) proteases cleaving human IgA1 in the hinge region into intact Fab and Fc fragments. To investigate whether these enzymes are subject to inhibition in vivo in humans, we tested 34 sera from periodontally diseased and healthy individuals in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence and titers of inhibition of seven Prevotella and Capnocytophaga proteases. All or nearly all of the sera inhibited the IgA1 protease activity of Prevotella buccae, Prevotella oris, and Prevotella loescheii. A minor proportion of the sera inhibited Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, and Prevotella melaninogenica IgA1 proteases, while no sera inhibited Capnocytophaga ochracea IgA1 protease. All inhibition titers were low, ranging from 5 to 55, with titer being defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum causing 50% inhibition of one defined unit of protease activity. No correlation between periodontal disease status and the presence, absence, or titer of inhibition was observed. The nature of the low titers of inhibition in all sera of the IgA1 proteases of P. buccae, P. oris, and P. loescheii was further examined. In size exclusion chromatography, inhibitory activity corresponded to the peak volume of IgA. Additional inhibition of the P. oris IgA1 protease was found in fractions containing both IgA and IgG. Purification of the IgG fractions of five sera by passage of the sera on a protein G column resulted in recovery of inhibitory IgG antibodies against all three IgA1 proteases, with the highest titer being for the P. oris enzyme. These finding indicate that inhibitory activity is associated with enzyme-neutralizing antibodies.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  - Microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). The study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. In each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (P1, P2, M1, M2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). These teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). A 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with an external sling suture. With oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, S. mutans, S. sanguis, Selenomonas sputigena, T. denticola, and T. vincentii) were present. Semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and Pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (P < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. These results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.
TI  - Fermentation product analysis in the identification of black-pigmented bacteria from periodontitis.
AB  - A quantitative procedure is described for the analysis of fermentation products of eight representative black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobic bacterial strains (Porphyromonas gingivalis 381, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611, Prevotella nigrescens ATCC 33563, Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845, Prevotella denticola ATCC 33185, and Prevotella loescheii ATCC 15930) from oral sites in humans, using gas-liquid chromatography. This procedure for the identification of clinical isolates was carried out and the results were in agreement with those obtained by other chemical, biochemical and serological assays. The isolates were classified as Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and two serotype groups of Porphyromonas gingivalis, based on the quantity of fatty acids.
TI  - Microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. The peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (IMZ type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. After grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media. The quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). The mean total cell count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. The following bacteria dominated: species of the family Bacteroidaceae (Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Prevotella oralis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella denticola); Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Capnocytophaga spp; and Eikenella corrodens. Bacteroidaceae and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. The increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.
TI  - Phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation on biofilms of Porphyromonas and Prevotella species.
AB  - Species of Prevotella (Pr.) and Porphyromonas (Po.) and other microorganisms were cultivated as biofilms on agar medium and examined for their susceptibility to argon laser irradiation (continuous mode; wavelengths, 488-514 nm; fluences, 20-200 J cm(-2)). Fluences of 35 to 80 J cm(-2) inhibited biofilm growth in Po. endodontalis, Po. gingivalis, Pr. denticola, Pr. intermedia, Pr. melaninogenica and Pr. nigrescens. A fluence of 70 J cm(-2) did not affect biofilm growth in species of Bacillus, Candida, Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. The phototoxic effects of argon laser irradiation against Prevotella and Porphyromonas species were: (1) caused by the radiation alone; (2) modified by biofilm age; (3) dependent on the presence of atmospheric oxygen; (4) influenced by medium supplements of hemin, hemoglobin and blood; (5) greater when compared with other microbial species; (6) demonstrated without augmentation with an exogenous photosensitizer; and (7) apparently unrelated to the protoporphyrin content of the cells. Overall, these in vitro findings suggest that low doses of argon laser radiation may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of clinical infections caused by biofilm-associated species of Prevotella or Porphyromonas.
TI  - An investigation into the use of SDS-PAGE of cell surface extracts and proteolytic activity to differentiate Prevotella nigrescens and Prevotella intermedia.
AB  - By comparison of the cell surface proteins derived from the outer membrane and fibrils from 14 Prevotella intermedia and 19 Prevotella nigrescens strains using SDS and analysed by SDS-PAGE, it was possible to distinguish the two species. A polypeptide of approx. 21 kDa distinguished P. intermedia strains, whereas two polypeptides of approx. 18 and 22 kDa could be used to identify P. nigrescens strains. Four other human oral black pigmented bacterial species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella melaninogenica) did not have the 18-, 21- or 22-kDa polypeptides shown by P. intermedia or P. nigrescens. The cell-associated proteolytic activity of eight strains of P. intermedia, 14 strains of P. nigrescens and one strain of P. gingivalis (W50) was assessed using four chromogenic substrates. The hydrolysis of the substrate GPPNA (indicative of dipeptidyl peptidase IV-like activity) and SAAPPNA (elastase-like activity) by P. intermedia strains varied from 32 to 114 units and 0.5 to 12.6 units of activity respectively, where one unit was defined as the amount of protease enzyme catalysing the formation of 1 nmol of p-nitroaniline under experimental conditions. 37.5% (3 of 8) of P. intermedia strains hydrolysed SAAPPNA (chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity) with activities of between 7 and 12 units. The hydrolysis of GPPNA and SAAAPNA by P. nigrescens strains was 32-149 and 3-16 units, respectively. 57% (8 of 14) of P. nigrescens strains hydrolysed SAAPPPNA with activities ranging from 3 to 8 units. None of the P. intermedia or P. nigrescens strains examined were found to have trypsin-like enzyme activity (BAPNA hydrolysis). The GPPNA and SAAAPNA hydrolytic activity associated with the proteases from Porphyromonas gingivalis W50 was at least twice that of P. intermedia and P. nigrescens strains. The similar peptidase activities of P. intermedia and P. nigrescens against chromogenic substrates cannot be used to differentiate the species, but SDS-PAGE of cell surface protein extracts allowed unambiguous speciation between P. intermedia and P. nigrescens. This simple technique of cell surface protein analysis can be performed in most laboratories and offers a convenient way by which to differentiate the two species.
TI  - Oligonucleotide probes to the 16S ribosomal RNA: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens.
AB  - Eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16S ribosomal RNA  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens. The 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. Alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated I Bi-2 to I Bi-6 (for P. intermedia) and 2Bi-2 (for P. nigrescens) with the 16S rRNA suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. A 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated Bi) reliably detected both species. Because of the high degree of concordance between the 16S rRNAs of both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. Thus probe I Bi-I recognised P. intermedia while I Bi-I detected both P. intermedia and P. nigrescens at low stringency. However, under conditions of high stringency only P. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2Bi-I. These probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with DNA from the closely related P. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as Prevotella melaninogenica, P. denticola, P. loescheii, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Py. endodontalis, Py. gingivalis, Py. levii, and Py. macacae.
TI  - The oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora in young children: longitudinal changes from edentulous to dentate mouth.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The composition of oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora was investigated in 21 young children (mean age 32 months) with primary dentition. The bacterial findings of samples were compared with those of the same children collected at their edentulous infant period (mean age 3 months). During the primary period, 2 samples were collected from each child: a sample with dental floss from gingival margin of 2 teeth and stimulated saliva pooled with a mucosal swab sample. Both samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically using nonselective and selective media. Prevotella melaninogenica, nonpigmented Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum group and Capnocytophaga spp. were found in all children at the older age, whereas they occurred in edentulous mouth in 76%, 62%, 67% and 19%, respectively. The occurrence of Prevotella loescheii increased from 14% to 90%, Prevotella intermedia from 10% to 67%, Leptotrichia spp. from 24 to 71%, Campylobacter (Wolinella) spp. from 5 to 43% and Eikenella corrodens from 5 to 57%. Only the occurrence of Bacteroides gracilis and Veillonella spp. remained at about the same level. Species not isolated from the edentulous mouth, such as Prevotella denticola, Fusobacterium spp. other than the F. nucleatum group and Selenomonas spp. were now detected in 71%, 71% and 43% of the children. The stability of the colonizing P. melaninogenica strain(s) in the oral cavity was determined by using ribotyping; 1-2 isolates per child from the edentulous infant period of 9 children and 3-15 isolates per child from their primary dentition period were analyzed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Investigation of the influences of puberty, genetics, and environment on the composition of subgingival periodontal floras.
AB  - The classical twin model was utilized in this study in an attempt to determine the importance of host genetics to the composition of the subgingival flora. Simultaneously, the effect of puberty on the flora composition was assessed. The compositions of the floras were significantly different at ages 11 and 14 in the same people, indicating that transition to an adult flora composition may be initiated during puberty. However, the numbers of subjects who had prepubertal and postpubertal testosterone levels in this study were too small to demonstrate significant differences based solely on testosterone level (P = 0.053 and 0.11 for tests of unrelated members, i.e., all twins "a," the first twin of each pair, and all twins "b," the second twin of each pair). Sixteen unrelated 11-year-old subjects had prepubertal levels of less than 30 ng of testosterone per dl of serum, and only six of these unrelated subjects had levels above 300 ng/dl by age 14. Of their twin siblings, who formed the second group of unrelated individuals, 15 had prepubertal levels and only 5 reached postpubertal levels. Unpaired t tests indicated that Veillonella atypica, Prevotella denticola, and Prevotella melaninogenica were among the species that contributed most to changes in flora composition during puberty. The compositions of subgingival floras of 11-year-old monozygous and dizygous male twins were significantly more similar than those of unrelated subjects in the study (P = 0.004 and 0.009, respectively). At 12.5 years of age, the floras of monozygous twins remained more similar than those of unrelated subjects (P = 0.001), but the dizygous-twin floras were not significantly more similar than those of unrelated people. This difference corresponded with moderate and varied testosterone levels within dizygous-twin pairs at age 12.5. By age 14 both monozygous and dizygous twins again had floras with compositions more similar than those of unrelated people (P = 0.008 and 0.002, respectively). Estimates of the genetic contributions to the increased similarity of the floras of twins as compared with floras of unrelated people indicated that the concentrations of several species in the flora may be influenced by host genetic factors. The prevalence of certain other species appeared to be controlled primarily by environment.
TI  - Characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  - Three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. Twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (Actinomyces, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Prevotella, and Actinobacillus). Nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four Prevotella denticola strains, two Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of P. melaninogenica, Streptococcus constellatus, and A. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. Incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. With one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the S. constellatus isolate. Genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in Escherichia coli using pBR322. Hemolytic clones were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). Extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three P. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. Two of the P. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 Kb inserts. The clone derived from the third strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 Kb region, but the flanking DNA showed no homology even though all three P. denticola isolates were shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Pigmented Prevotella species in the periodontally healthy oral cavity.
AB  - Pigmented Prevotella spp. have been connected with oral infections as well as being part of the healthy gingival flora. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of pigmented Prevotella spp. in saliva and gingival crevice samples from periodontally healthy adults. Twelve Caucasian female subjects (mean age 28 years, range 21-36 years) with no pockets > or = 4 mm, nor bleeding after probing were selected for this study. Paraffin-stimulated saliva was collected first; then, a pooled subgingival bacterial sample was taken with a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of all first molars. The samples were inoculated on to non-selective and selective media and incubated anaerobically. The most frequent species isolated were Pr. melaninogenica, Pr. intermedia and Pr. loescheu, found in 11, ten and nine subjects, respectively. The mean percentage of the total cultivable anaerobic microflora in salivary/subgingival samples were 14.7/0.6 for Pr. melaninogenica, 3.1/5.3 for Pr. intermedia and 2.6/1.2 for Pr. loescheii. Pr. denticola was found in one saliva sample and Pr. corporis, in two subgingival samples only. The number of different pigmented Prevotella spp. in the same mouth was 2-4 (mean 2.75). In conclusion, Pr. melaninogenica, Pr. intermedia and Pr. loescheii seem to be common microorganisms in the periodontally healthy oral cavity.
TI  - Black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in periodontitis.
AB  - Black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes have been associated with periodontal disease and tooth loss since they were first isolated by Burdon in 1928. Porphyromonas gingivalis, which is usually not isolated from children, adolescents or adults with no periodontal breakdown, has been recognized as one of the most important periodontopathogens. Its presence is strongly correlated with deep periodontal pockets, which are assumed to be its main habitat. Correlations have been shown also with attachment loss, clinical inflammation and serum antibody levels, indicating an aetiological role in the periodontal disease. Their pathogenicity in animal models resembling periodontal disease is documented. They are frequently isolated from periodontal abscesses. The relationship between Prevotella intermedia and periodontal disease is not clear. It is frequently isolated from advanced periodontitis, often as the only black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobic species; however, the prevalence in adults with no periodontal breakdown is high. It is found frequently in periodontal abscesses and in acute necrotizing and ulcerative gingivitis. Serogroup I is found predominantly in deep periodontal pockets, whereas all serogroups (I-III) are found in shallow pockets and gingivitis. No conclusive difference in pathogenicity between serogroups has been found. Pr. melaninogenica, Pr. denticola and Pr. loescheii are frequently found in the gingival crevice in preschool children and other age groups with gingivitis, but are seldom found in deep periodontal pockets.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of AXOL on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial action of AXOL was tested against a panel of periodontopathic bacteria, which included Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, Treponema sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The AXOL commercial solution (undiluted) was effective in inhibiting some of the bacteria but not all. The rational for the use of antimicrobials is discussed.
TI  - A pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of the non-pigmented Prevotella species.
AB  - Collection strains (21) and non-pigmented clinical isolates (96) provisionally identified as Prevotella spp. were classified numerically on the basis of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS) data and reaction patterns in conventional tests (CTRPs) for volatile and non-volatile fatty acids, pre-formed enzymes and biochemical activity. PMS and CTRP classifications were compared with a previous classification based on visual analysis of SDS-PAGE patterns. Although the order of clusters differed, cross-tabulation of cluster membership revealed strong correlations between classifications. Cluster membership in the PMS classification correlated particularly well with SDS-PAGE results. CTRP clusters corresponded largely to the recognised species of Prevotella, but PMS and SDS-PAGE divided two species into sub-groups: two in P. buccae and five in P. veroralis. The latter subgroups could be discriminated by small but consistent differences in CTRPs. An undesignated, well differentiated cluster of strains appeared closest to the main group of P. buccae strains in PMS and CTRPs. B. (P.) capillus could not be distinguished from P. buccae; these species are regarded as synonymous. Strains of P. zoogleoformans and B. (P.) pentosaceus were well separated from other strains in PMS. A complex comprising clusters of P. disiens, P. oralis, P. veroralis, P. loescheii and a further undesignated group similar to P. melaninogenica was well differentiated from P. buccae and P. oris in PMS; clusters corresponding to P. bivia, P. corporis, P. intermedia and P. denticola formed another complex.
TI  - Emended descriptions of Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella veroralis, and Prevotella melaninogenica.
AB  - During studies of human periodontal disease, a number of bacterial strains were encountered that, on the basis of results of standard biochemical tests, appeared to be Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, or Prevotella loescheii. However, use of the standard biochemical tests, cellular fatty acid analyses, and the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of soluble proteins resulted in conflicting identifications of these strains. The results of tests for cellobiose fermentation, inulin fermentation, and pigment production were responsible for most of the discordant results. Cellular fatty acid analyses in which the Microbial Identification System was used did not differentiate these strains from validly described species, even though separate library entries were created for them. DNA reassociation determinations in which the S1 nuclease procedure was used showed that cellobiose fermentation and pigment production are variable among strains of P. melaninogenica and P. denticola and that fermentation of xylan is not a reliable characteristic for differentiating P. buccalis from Prevotella veroralis. In contrast to previous indications, most strains of P. veroralis do not ferment xylan. These species can be differentiated by DNA-DNA reassociation and by cellular fatty acid analysis, using the Microbial Identification System, but differentiation by currently described phenotypic characteristics is not reliable. Similarly, P. loescheii and the genetically distinct (but closely related) D1C-20 group cannot be distinguished reliably from each other or from P. veroralis, P. denticola, and P. melaninogenica on the basis of currently described phenotypic tests other than cellular fatty acid composition or, for some species, electrophoretic patterns of soluble whole-cell proteins.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Bacteroides and other genera of Gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  - A numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of Bacteroides, Polyphyromonas, Prevotella [not Prevotella (Labroue, 1976)] and Fusobacterium. Isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. Computation of similarity coefficients was followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. At the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) Bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. necrogenes, F. necrophorum, F. nucleatum and F. varium; (3) B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. fragilis, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformus and B. vulgatus; (4) B. splanchnicus; (5) Porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) B. bivius (Prevotella bivia); (7) B. disiens (P. disiens); (8) B. intermedius (P. intermedia);and (9) B. melaninogenicus (P. melaninogenica). Single isolates of B. ruminicola (P. ruminicola), B. denticola (P. denticola) and B. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Rapid presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by using 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives.
AB  - A rapid method for presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods was developed. Using filter paper spot tests for indole production, sialidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-fucosidase, and trypsinlike enzyme activities, 100% of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Bacteroides levii and 89% of Prevotella corporis isolates were correctly identified to the species level. Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis could not be differentiated from each other but could be distinguished from all other species tested. Similarly, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, and Prevotella melaninogenica could not be differentiated from each other. The methods described are based on 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives of the various substrates and are simple to perform, rapid (less than 15 min), and applicable to difficult-to-cultivate anaerobic rods.
TI  - The use of whole-cell DNA probes for the identification of Bacteroides intermedius isolates in a dot blot assay.
AB  - Bacteroides intermedius includes two distinct groups of organisms that are phenotypically indistinguishable by conventional methods. These two groups are represented by the type strain of the species ATCC 25611T (B. intermedius type I) and by ATCC 33563 (B. intermedius type II). Members of each group can be distinguished from each other by analysis of the cellular protein composition by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and by DNA-DNA homology studies, because they share less than 40% homology. The purpose of this study was to prepare specific DNA probes for the two groups of Bacteroides intermedius and to test them against field isolates. Whole-cell DNA probes were prepared from B. intermedius types I and II and tested against 253 field strains of Bacteroides which had been identified by conventional phenotypic tests as B. intermedius. Of these, 170 (67%) hybridized with the B. intermedius type I DNA probe, 28 (11%) with the type II, and 23 (9%) failed to react with the B. intermedius probes but did hybridize with either B. melaninogenicus, B. loescheii, or B. corporis whole-cell DNA probes. The 32 (13%) remaining isolates failed to hybridize with any of the five Bacteroides probes or with probes to B. asaccharolyticus, B. buccae, B. buccalis, B. denticola, B. gingivalis, B. oralis, or B. oris. These data demonstrate the usefulness of whole-cell DNA probes for the identification of phenotypically similar or identical field isolates.
TI  - Use of the RapID-ANA System to screen for enzyme activities that differ among species of bile-inhibited Bacteroides.
AB  - The RapID-ANA System (Innovative Diagnostics Systems, Inc., Atlanta, Ga.) was used to test 102 strains of 14 species of phenotypically similar bile-inhibited Bacteroides from humans. Bacteroides oris, Bacteroides veroralis, Bacteroides buccalis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides loescheii, and Bacteroides denticola had very similar enzyme activity profiles. Clear differentiation of these six species by the RapID-ANA System was not possible, but tests for arginine aminopeptidase and beta-glucosidase were helpful. Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides disiens, Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, and Bacteroides buccae each had unique enzyme activity profiles. No consistent differences in enzyme activities were found between the two DNA homology groups within Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides loescheii, or Bacteroides intermedius. Tests for glycine aminopeptidase, alpha-galactosidase, arginine aminopeptidase, alpha-fucosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, reduction of triphenyltetrazolium, and production of indole were helpful in the differentiation of the species studied.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of some non-saccharolytic and saccharolytic Bacteroides species.
AB  - Various Bacteroides spp. were examined by physiological tests, presence of specific enzymes, antibiotic sensitivity, menaquinone composition and a few miscellaneous tests. The data matrix containing 58 strains and 55 unit characters was examined using Gower's similarity coefficients (SG) and included matching negative character states and multistate characters. The highly saccharolytic strains were separated from the less saccharolytic and non-fermentative strains at the 55% similarity level; while at the slightly higher level of 63% strains of Capnocytophaga (formerly Bact. ochraceus) were recovered as a compact phenon distinct from other saccharolytic species. The phenogram was divided into 6 clusters at 72% similarity level. Most of the 'Bact. fragilis group' of species clustered in one phenon while Bact. melaninogenicus ssp. melaninogenicus, Bact. bivius and a new species, Bact. denticola, formed another group. Another phenon comprised the saccharolytic non-pigmented species closely related to Bact. oralis such as Bact. buccalis and Bact. pentosaceus. The less saccharolytic strains of Bact. melaninogenicus ssp. intemedius and Bact. disiens were recovered in a distinct phenon. The low affinity (less than 55% similarity) between the two subspecies of Bact. melaninogenicus emphasised the need for reclassifying these taxa into separate species. The non-fermentative and very weakly saccharolytic strains formed good taxospecies. The separation of this cluster into three subclusters is in excellent agreement with chemotaxonomic data now available.
