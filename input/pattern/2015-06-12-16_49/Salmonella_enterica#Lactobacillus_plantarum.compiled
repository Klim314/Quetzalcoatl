TI  - Identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic Acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  - A total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. According to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences and recA gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these LAB isolates were identified as five species: Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus mundtii, Weissella cibaria and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. Those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. Based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two L. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains ZZU 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited Salmonella enterica ATCC 43971(T), Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698(T) and Escherichia coli ATCC 11775(T) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, pH and protease. Cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees C), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees C for 15 min. The antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (pH 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (pH 7.0 to 9.0). In addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease K. These results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains ZZU 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. The nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, KL-1Y, from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1.
AB  - Three bacteriocins from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin peptides KL-1X, -1Y and -1Z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 Da, respectively. All three peptides were stable at pH 2-12 and 25 degrees C and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees C for 30 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min. However, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. KL-1Y showed broad inhibitory activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis DMST 17368, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739. KL-1X and -1Z inhibited only Gram-positive bacteria. KL-1X, KL-1Y and KL-1Z exhibited synergistic activity. The successful amino acid sequencing of KL-1Y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin KL-1Y". Plantaricin KL-1Y exhibited bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus JCM 2152(T). Compared to nisin, KL-1Y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 AU/mL against the growth of Bacillus coagulans JCM 2257(T), B. cereus JCM 2152(T), Listeria innocua ATCC 33090(T), Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 118, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only B. coagulans JCM 2257(T) and B. cereus JCM 2152(T). Therefore, the novel plantaricin KL-1Y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
TI  - Protective Effects of a Novel Probiotic Strain of Lactobacillus plantarum JSA22 from Traditional Fermented Soybean Food Against Infection by Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - Lactobacillus species have been shown to enhance intestinal epithelial barrier function, modulate host immune responses, and suppress the growth of pathogenic bacteria, yeasts, molds, and viruses. Thus, lactobacilli have been used as probiotics for treating various diseases, including intestinal disorders, and as biological preservatives in the food and agricultural industries. However, the molecular mechanisms used by lactobacilli to suppress pathogenic bacterial infections have been poorly characterized. We previously isolated Lactobacillus plantarum JSA22 from buckwheat sokseongjang, a traditional Korean fermented soybean food, which possessed high enzymatic, fibrinolytic, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens. In this study, we investigated the effects of L. plantarum JSA22 on the growth of S. Typhimurium and S. Typhimurium-induced cytotoxicity by stimulating the host immune response in intestinal epithelial cells. The results showed that coincubation of S. Typhimurium and L. plantarum JSA22 with intestinal epithelial cells suppressed S. Typhimurium infection, S. Typhimurium-induced NF-kappaB activation, and IL-8 production, and lowered the phosphorylation of both Akt and p38. These data indicated that L. plantarum JSA22 has probiotic properties, and can inhibit S. Typhimurium infection of intestinal epithelial cells. Our findings can be used to develop therapeutic and prophylactic agents against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Safety evaluation of multiple strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and Pediococcus  pentosaceus in Wistar rats based on the Ames test and a 28-day feeding study.
AB  - Three lactic acid bacterial strains, Lactobacillus plantarum, HK006, and HK109, and Pediococcus pentosaceus PP31 exhibit probiotic potential as antiallergy agents, both in vitro and in vivo. However, the safety of these new strains requires evaluation when isolated from infant faeces or pickled cabbage. Multiple strains (HK006, HK109, and PP31) were subject to a bacterial reverse mutation assay and a short-term oral toxicity study. The powder product exhibited mutagenic potential in Salmonella Typhimurium strains TA98 and TA1535 (with or without metabolic activation). In the short-term oral toxicity study, rats received a normal dosage of 390 mg/kg/d (approximately 9 x 10(9) CFU/kg/d) or a high dosage of 1950 mg/kg/d (approximately 4.5 x 10(10) CFU/kg/d) for 28 d. No adverse effects were observed regarding the general condition, behaviour, growth, feed and water consumption, haematology, clinical chemistry indices, organ weights, or histopathologic analysis of the rats. These studies have demonstrated that the consumption of multiple bacterial strains is not associated with any signs of mutagenicity of S. Typhimurium or toxicity in Wistar rats, even after consuming large quantities of bacteria.
TI  - Antagonistic mechanisms of synbiosis between Lactobacillus plantarum CIF17AN2 and green banana starch in the proximal colon model challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium.
AB  - Antagonistic mechanisms of Lactobacillus plantarum CIF17AN2 (an infant isolate),  saba starch, and their synbiotic combination against Salmonella Typhimurium SA2093 were evaluated. The anti-Salmonella activity was investigated under the competitive niche of fecal microbiota using the simulated proximal colon model. The alterations of the dominant fecal microbiota and beneficial bacteria were also displayed using FISH and PCR-DGGE techniques. L. plantarum CIF17AN2 exhibited anti-Salmonella mechanisms through secretion of antimicrobial compounds, adhesion ability and competitive adhesion to mucin and HT-29 cell line. However, the Salmonella inhibition was significantly reduced in the presence of human fecal microflora. The combination of saba starch with L. plantarum CIF17AN2 showed the greatest inhibition against Sal. Typhimurium SA2093 in the simulated colon model. The enhancement of anti-Salmonella activity due to the addition of saba starch corresponded to a significant decrease in pH and an increase of lactic acid and short chain fatty acids. According to PCR-DGGE analysis, L. plantarum CIF17AN2 was able to survive and effectively compete with fecal microflora. Saba starch supplement modified bifidobacterial profile but had a slight impact on the profile of lactic acid bacteria. This prebiotic approach alleviated the nutrient limitation in the proximal colon model leading to the selective stimulation of beneficial lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, hence the enhancement of anti-Salmonella activity.
TI  - Pathogen exclusion properties of canine probiotics are influenced by the growth media and physical treatments simulating industrial processes.
AB  - AIMS: Manufacturing process used in preparation of probiotic products may alter beneficial properties of probiotics. The effect of different growth media and inactivation methods on the protective properties of canine-originated probiotic bacteria against adhesion of canine enteropathogens was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three established dog probiotics, Lactobacillus fermentum VET9A, Lactobacillus plantarum VET14A and Lactobacillus rhamnosus VET16A, and their mixture were assessed using the dog mucus pathogen exclusion model. The pathogens used were Enterococcus canis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Clostridium perfringens. The effect of growth media, one reflecting laboratory and the other manufacture conditions, and viability (viable and heat inactivated, 80 degrees C per 30 min) on the pathogen exclusion properties of probiotics were characterized. Greater pathogen exclusion percentages were noted for probiotics growing in conditions reflecting manufacture when compared to laboratory (P < 0.05). Inactivation of probiotics by heat (80 degrees C per 30 min) increased pathogen exclusion compared with their viable forms (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Manufacturing process conditions such as growth media, incubation temperature and pretreatment methods may significantly affect the protective properties of the tested strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Growing conditions and pretreatment methods should be carefully considered when designing new probiotics to reduce the risk of common infections in dogs. The studied probiotics are promising potential feed additives for dogs.
TI  - Evaluation and functional characterization of a biosurfactant produced by Lactobacillus plantarum CFR 2194.
AB  - The study details the investigations on the ability of Lactobacillus plantarum CFR 2194, an isolate from kanjika, a rice-based ayurvedic fermented product, to produce biosurfactant. Surfactant production, as a function of fermentation time, indicates that the maximum production occurred at 72 h under stationary conditions. Isolation, partial purification, and characterization of the biosurfactant produced have been carried out, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra demonstrated that biosurfactants were constituted by protein and polysaccharide fractions, i.e., possessed the structure typical of glycoprotein, which is affected by the medium composition and the phase of growth of the biosurfactant-synthesizing strain. Critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the biosurfactant was found to be 6 g l(-1). The emulsification index (EI), emulsification activity (EA), and emulsion stability (ES) values of the biosurfactant have confirmed its emulsification property. Aqueous fractions of the produced biosurfactant exhibited a significant antimicrobial activity against the food-borne pathogenic species: Escherichia coli ATCC 31705, E. coli MTCC 108, Salmonella typhi, Yersinia enterocolitica MTCC 859, and Staphylococcus aureus F 722. More importantly, the biosurfactant from L. plantarum showed antiadhesive property against above food-borne pathogens. The results thus indicate the potential for developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of food contact surfaces and health-care prosthesis using these biosurfactants.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of Lactobacillus isolates against Salmonella typhi in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enteric fever is a global health problem, and rapidly developing resistance to various drugs makes the situation more alarming. The potential use of Lactobacillus to control typhoid fever represents a promising approach, as it may exert protective actions through various mechanisms. METHODS: In this study, the probiotic potential and antagonistic activities of 32 Lactobacillus isolates against Salmonella typhi were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity of cell free supernatants of Lactobacillus isolates, interference of Lactobacillus isolates with the Salmonella adherence and invasion, cytoprotective effect of Lactobacillus isolates, and possibility of concurrent use of tested Lactobacillus isolates and antibiotics were evaluated by testing their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents, and their oxygen tolerance was also examined. RESULTS: The results revealed that twelve Lactobacillus isolates could protect against Salmonella typhi infection through interference with both its growth and its virulence properties, such as adherence, invasion, and cytotoxicity. These Lactobacillus isolates exhibited MIC values for ciprofloxacin higher than those of Salmonella typhi and oxygen tolerance and were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum. CONCLUSION: The tested Lactobacillus plantarum isolates can be introduced as potential novel candidates that have to be subjected for in vivo and application studies for treatment and control of typhoid fever.
TI  - Lack of correlation between in vitro antibiosis and in vivo protection against enteropathogenic bacteria by probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Increased resistance to infection is one of the beneficial effects attributed to  probiotic microorganisms. This effect may be due to several mechanisms: production of inhibitory substances, blocking of adhesion sites on the intestinal surface, competition for nutrients and stimulation of mucosal and systemic immunity. The present study aimed to investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of probiotic lactobacilli. The agar spot test was used to show that twenty Lactobacillus strains were able to inhibit the enteropathogenic bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica. This inhibition was mainly attributable to a decrease in pH resulting from dextrose fermentation by lactobacilli. The inhibition of Y. enterocolitica, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes by two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus casei C1 and Lactobacillus plantarum C4, was also associated with the pH decrease. However, both strains lacked protective effects in mouse experimental infection models, with the exception of long-lasting pre-treatment with L. plantarum C4, which exerted a partial protective effect against S. Typhimurium that was attributable to an immunostimulatory mechanism. Our results show that in vitro antibiosis tests do not provide useful information on the probiotic potential of Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Cell-free supernatants obtained from fermentation of cheese whey hydrolyzates and phenylpyruvic acid by Lactobacillus plantarum as a source of antimicrobial compounds, bacteriocins, and natural aromas.
AB  - Cheese whey hydrolyzates supplemented with phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) and commercial nutrients can be efficiently metabolized by Lactobacillus plantarum CECT-221 to biosynthesize some compounds with attractive applications in the food market. The main metabolites of cell-free extracts were antimicrobial compounds such as phenyllactic acid (PLA) and lactic acid (LA). The production of PLA by L. plantarum CECT-221 was evaluated in the Man-Rogosa-Sharpe broth supplemented with two biosynthetic precursors: phenylalanine or PPA. Using 30.5 mM PPA, the microorganism increased sevenfold the concentration of PLA producing 16.4 mM PLA in 46 h. A concentration of 40 mM PPA was a threshold to avoid substrate inhibition. The biosynthesis of whey hydrolyzates as a carbon source was enhanced by fed-batch fermentation of PPA; the average productivity of PLA increased up to 45.4 +/- 3.02 mM after 120 h with a product yield of 0.244 mM mM(-1); meanwhile, LA reached 26.1 +/- 1.3 g L(-1) with a product yield of 0.72 g g(-1). Cell-free fed-batch extracts charged in wells showed bacteriocin activity with halos of 7.49 +/- 1.44 mm in plates inoculated with Carnobacterium piscicola and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (11.54 +/- 1.14 mm), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.17 +/- 2.46 mm), Listeria monocytogenes (7.75 +/- 1.31 mm), and Salmonella enterica (3.60 +/- 1.52 mm). Additionally, the analysis of the volatile composition of the headspace of this cell-free extract revealed that L. plantarum is a potential producer for natural aromas, such as acetophenone, with high price in the market. This is the first report of PLA production from cheese whey and PPA. The extracts showed bacteriocin activity and potential to be applied as an antimicrobial in the elaboration of safer foods.
TI  - Effect of microencapsulation of Lactobacillus plantarum 25 into alginate/chitosan/alginate microcapsules on viability and cytokine induction.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 25 (LP25) encapsulated into alginate/chitosan/alginate (ACA) microcapsules (LP25-ACA MCs) prepared by an extrusion methods were characterized to assess their efficacy in oral delivery. The particle sizes of LP25-ACA MCs were 1.11 +/- 0.32 mm. The loading content of LP25 was 1.11 x 10(7) colony forming unit (cfu)/microcapsule and encapsulation efficiency was above 98%. The viability of LP25 in ACA MCs was more than 65% in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 2.0) and 75% in simulated small intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 7.2) up to 2 h. Encapsulated LP25 were completely released from LP25-ACA MCs in SIF and simulated colon fluid (SCF, pH 6.0) within 12 h and 8 h respectively. The viability of LP25 in ACA MCs till 5 weeks was above 58%, whereas viability of free LP25 stored at room temperature up to 5 weeks was zero. Besides, LP25-ACA MCs induced the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) from macrophages and dendritic cells showing the immunomodulatory effect of LP25. These findings demonstrate that the encapsulation of LP25 by ACA is a suitable strategy for oral delivery of probiotics.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of anti-infective activity of a Lactobacillus plantarum strain against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis infections are known to exhibit worldwide prevalence with increased morbidity and mortality. The conventional strategies like antibiotic therapy and vaccination have not only proved to be of sub-optimal efficacy but also led to the development of multidrug resistant strains of Salmonella. Antimicrobial activities of probiotics against various enteropathogens and other health promoting effects have assumed greater significance in recent years. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a Lactobacillus plantarum strain (KSBT 56, isolated from a traditional food product of India), in preventing Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis growth and pathogenicity in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: The cell free culture supernatant (CFCS) of KSBT 56 strain notably inhibited the growth of Salmonella Enteritidis without affecting the growth of other gram-positive lactic acid bacteria. The isolated KSBT 56 strain produces lactic acid similar to other standard probiotic strains like Lactobacillus plantarum MTCC 1407. The free radical production by KSBT 56 strain was studied by using sodC mutant of S. Enteritidis, which exhibited reduced growth in the presence of CFCS of the KSBT 56 strain, indicating the inhibitory activity of free radicals on the growth of S. Enteritidis. Our results also showed a significant reduction in the biofilm forming ability of Salmonella Enteritidis in the presence of the KSBT 56 strain (2 log cfu/ml, p = 0.01). Further, the anti-infective characteristics of KSBT 56 strain was validated by gentamicin protection assay which revealed 80% reduction in the invasion of Salmonella Enteritidis to HCT-116 cell line (Salmonella Enteritidis and KSBT 56 in a 1:1 ratio) and delayed addition of Salmonella Enteritidis by 1 h. Similarly, the reduced adhesion of Salmonella to the HCT-116 cells was observed along with the down regulation of hilA gene of Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI1) indicating that they might have acted synergistically to decrease the invasion of the pathogen into the cell line. CONCLUSIONS: KSBT 56 strain effectively inhibited the growth, invasion and the biofilm forming ability of Salmonella Enteritidis without inhibiting the growth of other Lactobacillus strains. Overall, our result suggested that KSBT 56 can be used as a potential probiotic strain with considerable beneficial effects on the host.
TI  - The expression of adhesin EF-Tu in response to mucin and its role in Lactobacillus adhesion and competitive inhibition of enteropathogens to mucin.
AB  - AIMS: To analyse the expression of EF-Tu in Lactobacillus strains with response to mucin exposure and its role in interfering with adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Lactobacillus strains were analysed for their ability to adhere to immobilized mucin in microtiter plates. Lactobacillus delbrueckii M and Lactobacillus plantarum CS24.2 showed statistically significant adhesion to mucin, which was similar to Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, the best binding probiotic strain. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lact. delbrueckii M, Lact. plantarum CS23 and Lact. plantarum CS24.2 were able to effectively antagonize the adhesion of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi to mucin. In the presence of Lactobacillus adhesin - EF-Tu, the adhesion of Lact. delbrueckii M and the strains of Lact. plantarum to mucin was significantly inhibited. Similarly, EF-Tu also reduced the adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin. Furthermore, the relative fold change in gene expression analysis showed significant up-regulation of EF-Tu gene in the strains of Lact. plantarum and Lact. delbrueckii M when exposed to mucin for 3 h. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the significant role of EF-Tu in lactobacilli adhesion and enteropathogens inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study suggests EF-Tu as an important factor linked to the Lactobacillus adhesion as well as enteropathogen inhibition. Lactobacillus plantarum CS23 and Lact. plantarum CS24.2 can be used as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - NHE8 plays an important role in mucosal protection via its effect on bacterial adhesion.
AB  - The Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE8 is expressed on the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells and is particularly abundant in the colon. Our previous study showed that Muc2 expression was significantly reduced in NHE8-knockout (NHE8-/-) mice, suggesting that NHE8 plays a role in mucosal protection in the colon. The current study confirms and extends our studies on the role of NHE8 in mucosal protection. The number of bacteria attached on the distal colon was significantly increased in NHE8-/- mice compared with their wild-type littermates. As expected, IL-4 expression was markedly increased in NHE8-/- mice compared with wild-type mice. Immunohistochemistry showed disorganization in the mucin layer of NHE8-/- mice, suggesting a possible direct bacteria-epithelia interaction. Furthermore, NHE8-/- mice were susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate-induced mucosal injury. In wild-type mice, dextran sodium sulfate treatment inhibited colonic NHE8 expression. In Caco-2 cells, the absence of NHE8 expression resulted in higher adhesion rates of Salmonella typhimurium but not Lactobacillus plantarum. Similarly, in vivo, S. typhimurium adhesion rate was increased in NHE8-/- mice compared with wild-type mice. Our study suggests that NHE8 plays important roles in protecting intestinal epithelia from infectious bacterial adherence.
TI  - Biotechnological production of phenyllactic acid and biosurfactants from trimming vine shoot hydrolyzates by microbial coculture fermentation.
AB  - Coculture fermentations show advantages for producing food additives from agroindustrial wastes, considering that different specified microbial strains are combined to improve the consumption of mixed sugars obtained by hydrolysis. This technology dovetails with both the growing interest of consumers towards the use of natural food additives and with stricter legislations and concern in developed countries towards the management of wastes. The use of this technology allows valorization of both cellulosic and hemicellulosic fractions of trimming vine shoots for the production of lactic acid (LA), phenyllactic acid (PLA), and biosurfactants (BS). This work compares the study of the potential of hemicellulosic and cellulosic fractions of trimming vine shoots as cheaper and renewable carbon sources for PLA and BS production by independent or coculture fermentations. The highest LA and PLA concentrations, 43.0 g/L and 1.58 mM, respectively, were obtained after 144 h during the fermentation of hemicellulosic sugars and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) carried out by cocultures of Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus pentosus. Additionally, cell-bond BS decreased the surface tension (ST) in 17.2 U; meanwhile, cell-free supernatants (CFS) showed antimicrobial activity against Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes with inhibition halos of 12.1+/-0.6 mm and 11.5+/-0.9 mm, respectively.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and probiotic potential of Lactobacillus plantarum HKN01:  a new insight into the morphological changes of antibacterial compound-treated Escherichia coli by electron microscopy.
AB  - Among several bacteria examined, an antibacterial-producing Lactobacillus strain  with probiotic characteristics was selected and identified based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Subsequent purification and mode of action of the antibacterial compounds on target cells including E. coli were investigated. Maximum production of the antibacterial compound was recorded at 18 h incubation at 30 degrees C. Interestingly, antibacterial activity remained unchanged after heating at 121 degrees C for 45 min, 24 h storage in temperature range of 70 degrees C to room temperature, and 15 min exposure to UV light, and it was stable in the pH of range 2-10. The active compounds were inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, indicating their proteinaceous nature, and, therefore, referred to as bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. Isolation and partial purification of the effective agent was done by performing ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration chromatography. The molecular mass of the GFC-purified active compound (~3 kDa) was determined by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. To predict the mechanisms of action, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of ultrathin sections of E. coli before and after antibacterial treatment was carried out. TEM analysis of antibacterial compounds-treated E. coli demonstrated that the completely altered bacteria appear much darker compared with the less altered bacteria, suggesting a change in the cytoplasmic composition. There were also some membrane-bound convoluted structures visible within the completely altered bacteria, which could be attributed to the response of the E. coli to the treatment with the antibacterial compound. According to the in vivo experiments oral administration of L. plantarum HKN01 resulted in recovery of infected BALB/c mice with Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium.
TI  - Factors affecting adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to Caco-2 cells and inhibitory effect on infection of Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - In this study, seven strains isolated from mustard leaf kimchi were screened for  their tolerance to simulated gastric and bile juices, the adhesive properties to Caco-2 cells, and the inhibition ability of Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 29631 adhesion. Lactobacillus acidophilus GK20, Lactobacillus paracasei GK74, and Lactobacillus plantarum GK81, which were resistant to bile as well as gastric juices, possessed high bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity towards both sodium glycocholate and sodium taurocholate. The strongest in vitro adherence of 53.96 +/- 4.49% was exhibited by L. plantarum GK81 followed by L. acidophilus GK20 with adhesion levels of 40.72 +/- 9.46%. The adhesion of these strains was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after exposure to pepsin and heating for 30 min at 80 degrees C. Addition of Ca2+ led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase of the adhesion of L. acidophilus GK20, but the adhesion ability of L. plantarum GK81 was not different from the control by the addition of calcium. In the competition and exclusion experiment, the adhesion inhibition of S. Typhimurium by L. plantarum GK81 strain was much higher than the other strains. Moreover, the exclusion inhibition of S. Typhimurium by L. acidophilus GK20 was considerably high, although the inhibition activity of this strain was lower than L. plantarum GK81.
TI  - In vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium.
AB  - 1. The aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control Salmonellae. 2. Nineteen LAB strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two Salmonella serotypes using a "Spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3. The size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between Salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the Salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the LAB strains. Lactobacillus salivarius, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each Salmonella strain. 4. The result of the acid tolerance test showed that all L. salivarius, L. kitasatonis strains and each of L. ingluviei cannot survive in a low pH environment. In the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except L. kitasatonis HE4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the L. salivarius and L. crispatus strains. 5. The results demonstrate that some LAB of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. The selected LAB could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.
TI  - Extracellular proteins from Lactobacillus plantarum BMCM12 prevent adhesion of enteropathogens to mucin.
AB  - The aim of this study was to study the interference of the extracellular proteins produced by Lactobacillus plantarum BMCM12 with the adhesion of some well-known gut pathogens. The extracellular proteins secreted by L. plantarum BMCM12 in MRS broth were precipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Discordances between the observed and the theoretical molecular masses of several proteins suggested the presence of protein glycosylation, corroborated with specific glycoprotein staining after protein de-glycosylation using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. Experiments of exclusion, competition, or prevention of the pathogen adhesion to mucin were performed using BMCM12 extracellular proteins, using Escherichia coli LMG2092 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica LMG15860. Extracellular proteins from BMCM12 reduced significantly the adhesion of the pathogens when they were added prior to adhesion assays. These proteins play thus important roles in preventing pathogen adhesion to the mucin layer.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Iron availability increases the pathogenic potential of Salmonella typhimurium and other enteric pathogens at the intestinal epithelial interface.
AB  - Recent trials have questioned the safety of untargeted oral iron supplementation  in developing regions. Excess of luminal iron could select for enteric pathogens at the expense of beneficial commensals in the human gut microflora, thereby increasing the incidence of infectious diseases. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of high iron availability on virulence traits of prevalent enteric pathogens at the host-microbe interface. A panel of enteric bacteria was cultured under iron-limiting conditions and in the presence of increasing concentrations of ferric citrate to assess the effect on bacterial growth, epithelial adhesion, invasion, translocation and epithelial damage in vitro. Translocation and epithelial integrity experiments were performed using a transwell system in which Caco-2 cells were allowed to differentiate to a tight epithelial monolayer mimicking the intestinal epithelial barrier. Growth of Salmonella typhimurium and other enteric pathogens was increased in response to iron. Adhesion of S. typhimurium to epithelial cells markedly increased when these bacteria were pre-incubated with increasing iron concentration (P = 0.0001), whereas this was not the case for the non-pathogenic Lactobacillus plantarum (P = 0.42). Cellular invasion and epithelial translocation of S. typhimurium followed the trend of increased adhesion. Epithelial damage was increased upon incubation with S. typhimurium or Citrobacter freundii that were pre-incubated under iron-rich conditions. In conclusion, our data fit with the consensus that oral iron supplementation is not without risk as iron could, in addition to inducing pathogenic overgrowth, also increase the virulence of prevalent enteric pathogens.
TI  - Augmentation of antimicrobial activity of conventional antibiotics by cell-free extract of L. plantarum.
AB  
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens by kimchi prepared with bacteriocin-producing starter culture.
AB  - Kimchi (starter kimchi) was prepared with Leuconostoc citreum GJ7, a bacteriocin  producer, with the objective of preventing growth and/or survival of foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhi, and Staphylococcus aureus. Numbers of the pathogens inoculated to 5.41 to 5.63 log CFU/mL into the filtrate of freshly made starter kimchi remained stable for the first 12 h of incubation at 10 degrees C. Reductions of 2.69, 2.88, and 3.42 log CFU/mL were observed 48 h after inoculation with E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhi, and S. aureus, respectively. Use of the bacteriocin-producing starter culture for kimchi fermentation significantly reduced the numbers of pathogens in the filtrate. Reductions of 3.85, 4.45, and 5.19 log CFU/mL were observed 48 h after inoculation for E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhi, and S. aureus, respectively. Presumably, the antimicrobial activity came from the ingredients of kimchi such as sulfur-containing compounds, low pH (approximately pH 4.5) produced by the conversion of sugars into organic acids and the bacteriocins potentially produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), such as kimchicin GJ7. Together, these data suggest that addition of a starter culture capable of producing bacteriocins could serve as a strategy to protect the fermented product from delivering pathogens upon consumption and that the kimchi filtrate itself may be used as a food preservative. Practical Application: The adaptation of the starter fermentation into kimchi induced a faster die off of the pathogens as compared to natural fermentation. The in situ bateriocin-production by Leuc. citreum GJ7 in kimchi would act with antimicrobial kimchi ingredients in a synergistic manner to protect the fermented product from delivering pathogens upon consumption.
TI  - Effect of L. plantarum cell-free extract and co-trimoxazole against Salmonella Typhimurium: a possible adjunct therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frequent and indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to the development of multi-drug resistant bacterial strains. It necessitates the exploitation of alternative therapeutic strategies. In order to reduce the dose of antibiotic required and to decrease the associated side effects, the present study was aimed at evaluating the synergism, if any, between a conventional antibiotic, co-trimoxazole (CTZ)) and cell free supernatant (CFS) of a probiotic (L. plantarum) against S. Typhimurium NCTC 74. This antimicrobial combination was selected on the basis of antibiotic susceptibility pattern of Salmonella and L. plantarum. METHODS: The synergy was evaluated in terms of size of zone of inhibition, fractional inhibitory concentration index, time-kill assay (in-vitro) as well as macrophage functions (ex-vivo). RESULTS: The concentration producing the same or higher antibacterial effect (size of zone of inhibition) was reduced to half when both the agents were used in combination with respect to the concentrations required when used separately. CTZ and CFS exhibited synergetic activity against Salmonella by checkerboard microtitre test and the time-kill test. Ex-vivo studies demonstrated a significantly higher intracellular killing of bacteria by macrophages treated with CFS (80 AU/ml) + (CTZ) (2 mug/ml) as compared to when treated with both separately at higher concentrations. Significant reduction in the extent of lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels generated by macrophages in presence of CFS and CTZ, in conjunction, further substantiated the synergistic efficacy of the combination. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial efficacy of this combination indicates that it may serve as the basis in developing alternative strategies to combat Salmonella infections.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - Protective effect of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 in mice.
AB  - AIMS: The anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 (DT104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: Explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation after oral infection with DT104 during fosfomycin (FOM) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS), which is naturally resistant to FOM, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. Comparison of the anti-Salmonella activity of several Lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to FOM revealed that Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 14869(T) , Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 14917(T) , Lactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112(T) , Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469(T) and Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741(T) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as LcS, Lact. casei ATCC 334(T) and Lactobacillus zeae ATCC 15820(T) . The increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower pH in the intestine because of Lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. Moreover, heat-killed LcS was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug resistant pathogens, such as DT104. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Antibiotics such as FOM disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.
TI  - Mode of action of plantaricin MG, a bacteriocin active against Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Plantaricin MG is a 2,180-Da bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum KLDS1.0391, which was isolated from Chinese traditional fermented cream. Plantaricin MG showed a broad inhibitory activity against not only Gram-positive bacteria but also Gram-negative bacteria including Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium. The mode of action of plantaricin MG on S. typhimurium was reported in this article. The addition of plantaricin MG to energized cells of S. typhimurium dissipated both, the transmembrane potential (Deltapsi) and the pH gradient (DeltapH). Energized membrane, obtained after the addition of glucose, was more susceptible to plantaricin MG action, leading to the release of intracellular K(+)ions, inorganic phosphate, ATP and UV-absorbing materials. These data suggest that the presence of a proton motive force promotes the interaction of plantaricin MG with the cytoplasmic membrane of energized cells, leading to pores formation which allows the efflux of ions, thereby ensuring efficient killing of target bacteria.
TI  - Detection of changes in the cellular composition of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in the presence of antimicrobial compound(s) of Lactobacillus strains using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  - It was previously established that Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC 179, Lactobacillus plantarum ACA-DC 287 and Lactobacillus plantarum ACA-DC 2350 exhibit antimicrobial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. In order to further investigate the killing effect of these microorganisms against Salmonella cells, we employed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Salmonella cells were incubated with different concentrated lactobacilli supernatants and their FT-IR spectra were recorded. The second derivative transformation of the original spectra revealed changes in spectral regions corresponding to absorptions of major cellular constituents (e.g. cell wall, cell membrane, and proteins of the cell) among the Salmonella cells treated with the supernatants and those treated with the control samples. Principal component analysis of the second derivative transformed spectra showed that the yet unidentified antimicrobial compound(s) produced by the lactobacilli tested clearly interfered with the fatty acids of the cell membrane, as well as the polysaccharides of the cell wall in Salmonella cells, pointing towards a dual killing mode. Our study shed light for the first time in the anti-Salmonella activity of the particular Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and Taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  - This study assessed potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from Taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. Lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. Technologically interesting Lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Effect of probiotic-, bacteriophage-, or organic acid-supplemented feeds or fermented soybean meal on the growth performance, acute-phase response, and bacterial shedding of grower pigs challenged with Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium.
AB  - A 28-d experiment evaluated the growth performance, acute-phase response, and bacterial shedding patterns in pigs (n = 108; initially, 38.7 +/- 6.7 kg) fed 6 treatment diets, including a control diet with no antimicrobial agents (CON), a positive control diet containing chlortetracycline, 100 mg/kg (CT), a diet containing anti-Salmonella Typhimurium bacteriophage, 3 x 10(9) plaque-forming units/kg of feed (ASB), Lactobacillus plantarum CJLP56, 6.5 x 10(8) cfu/kg of feed (LP), 0.2% microencapsulated organic acids (MOA), or 5% fermented soybean meal (FSM). Pigs were fed the diets for 2 wk before and 2 wk after challenging orally with Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (SalT). Before bacterial challenge, ADFI was similar in all groups. After SalT challenge, ADFI of CON pigs was less (P < 0.05) than all other groups. Before challenge, pigs on MOA, FSM, and CT diets had greater (P < 0.05) ADG and G:F than CON pigs. After challenge (wk 3 to 4) and during the overall experimental period (wk 1 to 4), ADG of all treatment groups and G:F of all treatment groups except the LP group were greater (P < 0.05) than those of CON pigs. Relative to all other treatments, CON and LP pigs had greater (P < 0.05) bacterial shedding scores on d 7 after SalT challenge. At d 14 postchallenge, shedding scores declined (P < 0.05) in all treatment groups compared with CON pigs. Serum haptoglobin for all treatment groups increased from d 0 concentrations on d 6 postchallenge and declined to prechallenge concentrations on d 13 (P < 0.05). Circulating IGF-I concentrations declined from 2 to 6 d postchallenge and increased again by d 13 in ASB and LP groups, did not decline in FSM and CT groups, and continuously declined through d 13 in CON and LP groups (P < 0.05). However, in MOA group, IGF-I concentrations declined from preinfection concentrations on d 2, increased on d 4, and declined again until d 13 (P < 0.05). The serum concentrations of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-1beta were not generally affected by SalT challenge. In conclusion, acute infection of growing pigs with SalT was associated with short-term febrile responses in most pigs and reductions in ADFI and ADG of CON pigs. Compared with the CON diet, ASB, FSM, and MOA diets had a similar benefit to the antibiotic-supplemented diet in improving the performance of growing pigs, especially after bacterial challenge. However, further work needs to be done to better understand their mode of action in this class of pigs.
TI  - Microbial products from probiotic bacteria inhibit Salmonella enteritidis 857-induced IL-8 synthesis in Caco-2 cells.
AB  - Oral administration of Lactobacillus spp. as probiotics is gaining importance in  the treatment of intestinal inflammations. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. We investigated whether nonspecific binding Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) and mannose-specific Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp) and their spent culture supernatant (SCS) affect Salmonella enteritidis 857 (Se) growth, IL-8 and Hsp70 syntheses. In one set of experiments human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells were infected with LcS, Lp or Se at 1-500 bacteria per cell for 1 h. In another set, cells were exposed to Se (0-200 per cell, 1 h) after exposure to lactobacilli (LB) (500 per cell, 30 min) or by co-incubation of Se and LB (1 h). The third set of experiments involved exposure of cells for 1 h to SCS or Se (100 per cell) pretreated (1 h) in SCS. The effect of LB SCS on Se growth was evaluated by agar plate diffusion test. IL-8 and Hsp70 were assessed over 2-24 h using ELISA and Western blotting, respectively. Neither LcS nor Lp affected the Se growth and IL-8 production. In addition, they did not induce Hsp70 expression by Caco-2 cells. Instead, their SCS inhibited the Se growth and IL-8 production and induced the expression of Hsp70 by both crypt- and villus-like cells. The beneficial effect of Lactobacillus spp. to the intestinal inflammations might be associated with a decrease in IL-8 levels. This effect could be mediated, at least in part, via a secreted antimicrobial product(s) either directly against the pathogens or indirectly through the synthesis of Hsp70.
TI  - Response of porcine intestinal in vitro organ culture tissues following exposure  to Lactobacillus plantarum JC1 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344.
AB  - The development of novel intervention strategies for the control of zoonoses caused by bacteria such as Salmonella spp. in livestock requires appropriate experimental models to assess their suitability. Here, a novel porcine intestinal in vitro organ culture (IVOC) model utilizing cell crown (CC) technology (CCIVOC) (Scaffdex) was developed. The CCIVOC model was employed to investigate the characteristics of association of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 with porcine intestinal tissue following exposure to a Lactobacillus plantarum strain. The association of bacteria to host cells was examined by light microscopy and electron microscopy (EM) after appropriate treatments and staining, while changes in the proteome of porcine jejunal tissues were investigated using quantitative label-free proteomics. Exposure of porcine intestinal mucosal tissues to L. plantarum JC1 did not reduce the numbers of S. Typhimurium bacteria associating to the tissues but was associated with significant (P < 0.005) reductions in the percentages of areas of intestinal IVOC tissues giving positive staining results for acidic mucins. Conversely, the quantity of neutrally charged mucins present within the goblet cells of the IVOC tissues increased significantly (P < 0.05). In addition, tubulin-alpha was expressed at high levels following inoculation of jejunal IVOC tissues with L. plantarum. Although L. plantarum JC1 did not reduce the association of S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 to the jejunal IVOC tissues, detection of increased acidic mucin secretion, host cytoskeletal rearrangements, and proteins involved in the porcine immune response demonstrated that this strain of L. plantarum may contribute to protecting the pig from infections by S. Typhimurium or other pathogens.
TI  - Oral administration of heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum strain b240 protected  mice against Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum strain b240 (b240) on systemic infection by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and to determine the mechanism by which b240 protects against infection. Mice were administered either b240 or saline orally for 3 weeks, and then inoculated with S. Typhimurium. The mice treated with b240 were significantly protected against S. Typhimurium as compared to those fed saline. Moreover, translocation of S. Typhimurium into each organ tested in the mice that received b240 tended to be less than in the control mice. An important mechanism of protection against infection was demonstrated by the ability of b240 to inhibit both binding by and invasion of S. Typhimurium into cells. These results indicate that nonviable lactic acid bacteria also play important roles in preventing infection by enteric pathogens.
TI  - Microbial inhibitory and radical scavenging activities of cold-pressed terpeneless Valencia orange (Citrus sinensis) oil in different dispersing agents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to their low solubility in water, oil-based bioactive compounds require dispersion in a surface-active agent or appropriate solvents to ensure maximum contact with microorganisms. These combinations, however, may change their physical and/or chemical characteristics and consequently alter the desired functionality. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of selected dispersing agents, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and Tween-80, on cold-pressed terpeneless (CPT) Valencia orange oil to function as a free radical scavenger and an antimicrobial food additive. RESULTS: When dissolved in ethanol or DMSO, the orange oil fraction had similar minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19 115 (0.3% and 0.25% v/v respectively), which were significantly lower (P <or= 0.5) than the MIC for Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14 028 (1% v/v). Both ethanol and DMSO oil dispersion systems exhibited an intermediate MIC (0.75% v/v) for Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1. The orange oil (up to 3%) in an aqueous solution of 0.1% Tween-80 yielded no inhibitory activities against any of the test bacteria. However, the 1% natural orange oil dispersed in Tween-80 exhibited 56.86% 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical inhibition versus 18.37% and 16.60% when the same level of orange oil was dissolved in DMSO or ethanol, respectively. At the same orange oil concentration, the oil/Tween-80 suspension yielded 57.92% neutralization of hydroxyl radicals. This represents 71.37% of the mannitol antioxidant activity, which was used as a positive control. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Tween-80 is an appropriate dispersing agent only if the antioxidant functionality is desired. If both antimicrobial and antioxidant properties are needed, the CPT Valencia orange oil should be dispersed in either DMSO or ethanol.
TI  - Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA and Lactobacillus plantarum 423 alleviated symptoms of Salmonella infection, as determined in Wistar rats challenged with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - Wistar rats were administered daily with Lactobacillus plantarum 423 and Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA through intragastric gavage (1 x 10(8) cfu of each strain and a combination of the two strains). Sterile saline was used as placebo. After 7 days, the animals were challenged by infection with 2 x 10(8) CFU Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. After 1 day of treatment with L. plantarum 423 and E. mundtii ST4SA, the feed and water intake, and body weight of the rats increased. The faecal moisture content and beta-glucuronidase activity remained more-or-less constant after 2 days of treatment with E. mundtii ST4SA, L. plantarum 423 and a combination of the two strains. Reduced levels of endotoxin were recorded in blood samples taken from rats that received L. plantarum 423 and E. mundtii ST4SA. Although both strains alleviated symptoms of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium infection, L. plantarum 423 administered as a single culture proved more effective than E. mundtii ST4SA. Less promising results were recorded when L. plantarum 423 was administered in combination with E. mundtii ST4SA. This suggests that L. plantarum 423 is more effective than E. mundtii and should be the preferred probiotic to alleviate symptoms of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium infection.
TI  - Inhibition of fungi and gram-negative bacteria by bacteriocin BacTN635 produced by Lactobacillus plantarum sp. TN635.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate 54 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains isolated from meat, fermented vegetables and dairy products for their capacity to produce antimicrobial activities against several bacteria and fungi. The strain designed TN635 has been selected for advanced studies. The supernatant culture of this strain inhibits the growth of all tested pathogenic including the four Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella enterica ATCC43972, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 49189, Hafnia sp. and Serratia sp.) and the pathogenic fungus Candida tropicalis R2 CIP203. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the strain TN635 (1,540 pb accession no FN252881) and the phylogenetic analysis, we propose the assignment of our new isolate bacterium as Lactobacillus plantarum sp. TN635 strain. Its antimicrobial compound was determined as a proteinaceous substance, stable to heat and to treatment with surfactants and organic solvents. Highest antimicrobial activity was found between pH 3 and 11 with an optimum at pH = 7. The BacTN635 was purified to homogeneity by a four-step protocol involving ammonium sulfate precipitation, centrifugal microconcentrators with a 10-kDa membrane cutoff, gel filtration Sephadex G-25, and C18 reverse-phase HPLC. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified BacTN635, revealed a single band with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 4 kDa. The maximum bacteriocin production (5,000 AU/ml) was recorded after a 16-h incubation in Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) medium at 30 degrees C. The mode of action of the partial purified BacTN635 was identified as bactericidal against Listeria ivanovii BUG 496 and as fungistatic against C. tropicalis R2 CIP203.
TI  - Effects of enteropathogenic bacteria & lactobacilli on chemokine secretion & Toll like receptor gene expression in two human colonic epithelial cell lines.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The intestinal epithelium is part of the innate immune system responding to contact with pathogenic or commensal bacteria. The objective of this study was to compare innate responses of intestinal epithelial cell lines to pathogenic bacteria and to lactobacilli. METHODS: Two human intestinal epithelial cell lines, HT29 (enterocyte-like) and T84 (crypt-like), were exposed to pathogenic bacteria representative of non invasive (Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139), adherent (enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, EHEC) or invasive (Salmonella Typhimurium and Shigella flexneri) phenotypes and to non pathogenic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Lactobacillus plantarum. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) was measured in culture supernatant by ELISA, while mRNA from cells was subjected to quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR for several other chemokines (CXCL1, CCL5 and CXCL5) and for Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, 4, 5 and 9. RESULTS: V. cholerae, S. Typhimurium, S. flexneri and EHEC induced IL-8 secretion from epithelial cells into the medium. Salmonella, Shigella and EHEC, but not V. cholerae, significantly increased mRNA expression of CXCL1. None of the pathogens induced CCL5 or CXCL5. Salmonella and Vibrio significantly increased TLR4 expression, while Vibrio and EHEC decreased TLR5 expression. EHEC also decreased TLR9 expression. Lactobacilli attenuated the IL-8 response of the cell lines to V. cholerae, Salmonella, and EHEC but did not significantly change the IL-8 response to Shigella. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Distinct patterns of epithelial cell chemokine responses were induced by the bacterial pathogens studied and these were modulated by commensal lactobacilli. Alterations in TLR expression by these pathogens are likely to be important in pathogenesis.
TI  - Survival and growth of Salmonella and Vibrio in som-fak, a Thai low-salt garlic containing fermented fish product.
AB  - Fermentation of raw fish is a common process in Asia for improvement of shelf life and safety, however, little is known about the survival of pathogenic bacteria in these products. Raw fish may be contaminated with Salmonella and Vibrio species. The purpose of this study was to determine survival and potential growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Weltevreden, S. enterica serovar Enteritidis, Vibrio cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus as influenced by the preservation parameters (sodium chloride, garlic and lactic acid) present in the Thai fermented fish product som-fak. The inhibitory effects of sodium chloride (0-4%), garlic (0-10%) and lactic acid (pH levels as in som-fak) were measured in modified brain heart infusion (BHI) broth at 30 degrees C. All bacteria were inhibited by 8-10% sodium chloride. Salmonella grew in all concentrations of garlic whereas Vibrio spp. were inhibited by 1.0-1.5%. Lactic acid was inhibitory at levels above 1.5%. The combinations of sodium chloride, lactic acid and garlic showed a distinct hurdle effect in the broth system. Neither S. Enteritidis, V. cholerae nor V. parahaemolyticus grew in garlic (0.5-1%), regardless of the level of sodium chloride (0.5-4% (w/v)), when lactic acid (0.5-2%) was present. S. Weltevreden was the least inhibited of the four bacteria and grew in the combination of 0.5% garlic and 0.5% lactic acid regardless of the NaCl level (0.5-4% (w/v)). Som-fak with 0 to 10% garlic or 2% glucose was inoculated with either (i) 10(3) CFU/g Salmonella Weltevreden, (ii) 10(6) CFU/g garlic fermenting Lactobacillus plantarum strain 509 or (iii) a combination of the two strains and stored at 30 degrees C. The Salmonella count increased to >10(8) CFU/g (>10(6) CFU/g for 10% garlic) in all types of som-fak inoculated with S. Weltevreden within the first day. Only a combination of at least 6% garlic and L. plantarum 509 was enough to prevent growth of the inoculated Salmonella whereas adding the Lactobacillus strain alone or in combination with glucose was insufficient to prevent growth. Our results show that Salmonella Weltevreden can grow in som-fak independently of the inhibitory substances normally present in this type of product, emphasising the importance of preventing contamination. However, our results also suggest that the use of garlic fermenting starter cultures in combination with garlic could improve safety of fermented fish products.
TI  - Efficiency of a Lactobacillus plantarum-xylanase combination on growth performances, microflora populations, and nutrient digestibilities of broilers infected with Salmonella Typhimurium.
AB  - Three experiments were performed to assess the ability of a Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic combined with a xylanase to reduce the effects of Salmonella Typhimurium infection in broiler chickens from 1 to 30 or 42 d of age. Chicks were challenged at 3 d of age with 10(8) or 10(5) cfu Salmonella Typhimurium/chick. Four diets were studied: a wheat-based diet (C+) supplemented with 0.1 g/kg of xylanase (E) or 10(6) cfu/g of L. plantarum (P), or both (PE). Uninfected chicks fed the C diet were used as negative control (C-). Six or 8 chicks were housed per cage with 9 cages/treatment. Growth performance and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded weekly. In experiment 1, bacterial enumeration in ceca was achieved using the fluorescent in situ hybridization technique. Salmonella enumeration was realized in excreta by microbiological cultures (experiments 2 and 3). Nutrient digestibilities and AME(n) were determined in experiment 3 from d 35 to 39. Infection with Salmonella Typhimurium led to a significant decrease in the daily weight gain (DWG) by 23.6 to 32.8%, whereas FCR was increased by 1.0 to 19.7%. Chickens fed the PE diet showed significantly improved performance in comparison with C+ birds (DWG: +12.5% in experiment 1; FCR: -2.1 to 8.6%), and in comparison with the P and E treatments (DWG: +6.3 to 8.3% in experiment 1; FCR: -2.7 to 6.4%). In experiment 3, the FCR was significantly improved by 3% with the PE diet in comparison with C- chickens. The PE combination tended to restore a microflora similar to that of uninfected broilers, whereas the P and E diets had less of an effect on the profile of bacterial communities. At slaughter age, Salmonella contamination was reduced by 2.00 and 1.85 log colony-forming units for the E and PE treatment, respectively. The PE diet significantly reduced the crude fat digestibility by 9.2%, in comparison with the C+ chickens. These results suggest that the combination between L. plantarum and a xylanase as feed additive could be effective for reduction of the detrimental effect after Salmonella Typhimurium infection of broilers.
TI  - Lactobacilli stimulate the innate immune response and modulate the TLR expression of HT29 intestinal epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  - The potentially probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum BFE 1685 isolated from a child's faeces and the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG were investigated for their capability to influence the innate immune response of HT29 intestinal epithelial cells towards Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Furthermore, their capacity to modulate toll-like receptor expression of HT29 cells was investigated at the mRNA and protein levels. TNF-alpha was used in cell culture with HT29 cells to mimic an inflammatory background, and in the presence of this chemokine HT29 cells were sensitised to respond to the Lactobacillus strains as evidenced by an increased response in IL-8 production. In addition, when HT29 cells were first treated with lactobacilli and then infected with S. Typhimurium, the IL-8 levels in response to S. Typhimurium were significantly higher, indicating that HT29 cells were sensitised by lactobacilli. Neither of the lactobacilli was able to stimulate TLR4 production at the mRNA level, however, TLR2 and TLR9 transcription levels measured by quantitative PCR were up-regulated when HT29 cells were incubated with lactobacilli, but not with S. Typhimurium. Up-regulation of TLR9 expression was higher for L. rhamnosus GG than for L. plantarum BFE 1685. Expression levels of TLR2 and TLR5 were enhanced also at the protein level as determined by flow cytometry after staining with the respective antibodies. In contrast, TLR9 expression was not significantly up-regulated, which may be explained by protein degradation, or possible down-stream regulatory effects. These findings show that stimulation of specific signaling pathways occurs in the cross-talk between probiotic bacteria and gut epithelium cells, which can help to explain the adjuvant properties of probiotic lactobacilli.
TI  - Selection of lactic acid bacteria from fermented plant beverages to use as inoculants for improving the quality of the finished product.
AB  - Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) from fermented plant beverages were selected based on  their antibacterial actions against potential food borne pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus PSSCMI 0004, Escherichia coli PSSCMI 0001, Salmonella typhimurium PSSCMI 0034 and Vibrio parahaemolyticus VP 4). Antibacterial activities were measured using an agar spot method. The Lactobacillus plantarum W90A strain isolated from a wild forest noni (Morinda coreia Ham) beverage was used as an inoculant. Three different inoculation procedures were conducted with the fruit of wild forest noni fermentations to establish which one was the best for controlling the numbers of yeast in the finished product. A 5% inoculum of L. plantarum W90A (LAB set), initial cell density 8.6 log cfu mL(-1), produced a better product and inhibitory properties against the test organisms, particularly E. coli PSSCMI 0001 than one with no inoculum or with a 5% inoculum from a previous natural fermented product. An LAB inoculum resulted in a reduced total bacterial count and no yeast throughout fermentation period (90 days). The lower yeast resulted in a reduction of the ethanol content to 2.9 g L(-1) compared to 12.2 g L(-1) inthe culture with no inoculum. The highest acidity (1.3-1.4%) with the same pH (3.3) was observed in both sets of inoculated fermentations, whereas the uninoculated set gave a pH value of 3.7 (1.2% acidity).
TI  - Isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  - This study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. Two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed LAMVAB agar). Microscopy, the catalase test, Gram-staining, and RAPD-PCR analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. Phenotypic analysis using the API 50 CH test and genotypic analysis of 16S rDNA sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri. Bacterial survival under the conditions of low pH (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v) of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 33199). The isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, Escherichia coli K88 and Salmonella typhimurium. The high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as piglet probiotics.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - Interaction of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains with human intestinal epithelial cells: adhesion properties, competition against enteropathogens and modulation of IL-8 production.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human nutrition and health by promoting the supply of nutrients, preventing pathogen colonization and shaping and maintaining normal mucosal immunity. The depletion of the individual microbiota can result in a higher susceptibility to enteropathogenic bacteria infection. In order to reduce this risk, the use of food supplements containing probiotic bacteria has been recently addressed. In this paper, we investigate the protective role toward enteropathogen infection of probiotic strains belonging to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. According to our experimental data, Lactobacillus acidophilus Bar13, L. plantarum Bar10, Bifidobacterium longum Bar33 and B. lactis Bar30 were effective in displacing the enteropathogens Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli H10407 from a Caco-2 cell layer. Moreover, L. acidophilus Bar13 and B. longum Bar33 have been assessed for their immunomodulatory activity on IL-8 production by HT29 cells. Both strains showed the potential to protect enterocytes from an acute inflammatory response. These probiotic strains are potential candidates for the development of new functional foods helpful in counteracting enteropathogen infections.
TI  - Characterization of homofermentative lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains: potential use as probiotic.
AB  - Considering that several health promoting properties are associated with kefir consumption and a reliable probiotic product requires a complete identification of the bacterial species, the present work evaluates several proved markers of probiotic potential of eleven isolates of homofermentative lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains and molecular identification and genotypic diversity. Using restriction analysis of amplified ribosomal DNA (ARDRA) and analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA internal spacer region we confirmed that all homofermentative lactobacilli belong to the species Lactobacillus plantarum. RAPD-PCR analysis allowed the discrimination of lactobacilli in five clusters. All isolates exhibited high resistance to bile salt. High survival after one hour of exposure to pH 2.5 was observed in Lb. plantarum CIDCA 8313, 83210, 8327 and 8338. All isolates were hydrophilic and non autoaggregative. Isolate CIDCA 8337 showed the highest percentage of adhesion among strains. All tested lactobacilli had strong inhibitory power against Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Seven out of eleven isolates showed inhibition against Sal. enterica and five isolates were effective against Sal. gallinarum. Only CIDCA 8323 and CIDCA 8327 were able to inhibit Sal. sonnei. We did not find any correlation between the five clusters based on RAPD-PCR and the probiotic properties, suggesting that these isolates have unique characteristics.
TI  - Functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  - This paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. Functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. The organisms previously identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. fermentum, Lb. acidophilus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc dextranicum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees C) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). The pH fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with Lb. plantarum; 4.37 in L. dextranicum+S. cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. Significant differences (P <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. Bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among pH and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. Antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic A. flavus. The findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.
TI  - Bioprotection of Golden Delicious apples and Iceberg lettuce against foodborne bacterial pathogens by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from fresh vegetables and fruit and its ability to inhibit the growth of foodborne human pathogens (Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) was tested using the agar spot assay. Eighteen isolates showed a strong antagonistic capacity and were further characterised and identified using 16S rDNA sequencing and API 50CH. Most of them pertained to Leuconostoc spp. and Lactobacillus plantarum, and a few corresponded to Weissella spp. and Lactococcus lactis. Growth and efficacy of control of foodborne pathogen test bacteria by selected strains were tested in wounded Golden Delicious apples and Iceberg lettuce leaf cuts. The strains grew on the substrates and did not cause negative effects on the general aspect of tissues of apple or lettuce. Treatment of apple wounds and lettuce cuts with the antagonistic strains reduced the cell count of S. typhimurium and E .coli by 1 to 2 log cfu/wound or g, whereas the growth of L. monocytogenes was completely inhibited. Results support the potential use of lactic acid bacteria as bioprotective agents against foodborne human pathogens in ready-to-eat fresh fruit and vegetable products.
TI  - The Lactobacillus plantarum strain ACA-DC287 isolated from a Greek cheese demonstrates antagonistic activity in vitro and in vivo against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of  the Xynotyri cheese isolate Lactobacillus plantarum ACA-DC287 using a set of in vitro and in vivo assays. METHODS AND RESULTS: The co-culture of L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 results in the killing of the pathogen. The killing activity was produced mainly by non-lactic acid molecule(s) that were present in the cell-free culture supernatant of the L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287. The culture of the L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287 inhibited the penetration of S. typhimurium SL1344 into cultured human enterocyte-like Caco-2/TC7 cells. In conventional mice infected with S. typhimurium SL1344, the intake of L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287 results in a decrease in the levels of Salmonella associated with intestinal tissues or those present in the intestinal contents. In germ-free mice, the L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287 colonized the gastrointestinal tract. CONCLUSIONS: The L. plantarum strain ACA-DC287 strain exerts anti-Salmonella activity similar that of the established probiotic strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus casei Shirota YIT9029 and Lactobacillus johnsonii La1. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The observation that a selected cheese Lactobacillus strain exerted antibacterial activity that was similar to those of probiotic Lactobacillus strains, is of interest for the use of this strain as an adjunct strain for the production of health-giving cheeses.
TI  - New signaling molecules in some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A new family of putative signaling molecules having a 2(5H)-furanone configuration has been described in this work. They were released during late exponential or stationary phase in different growth media by some gram-positive bacteria, such as Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Enterococcus faecalis, and a gram-negative species, i.e. Salmonella enterica. A pair of 2(5H)-furanones called furanones A and B occurred in all the conditioned media (CMs) of the species considered. These two molecules showed similar retention times and their spectral data shared the key fragments to include them in the 2(5H)-furanones family. However, some differences were observed in the mass fragmentation profiles. In particular the use of PCA analysis of all the mass fragments enabled the grouping of furanone A profiles of S. enterica, L. helveticus, L. plantarum, L. paraplantarum, L. sanfranciscensis and E. faecalis in one unique cluster with only few exceptions. On the other hand, the mass fragmentation profiles of furanone B of the major part of the species and strains could be grouped together and were differentiated from those of L. helveticus. The specific activity of cell-free supernatants of high density cultures of S. enterica confirmed that the release of active molecules, and specifically of furanones A and B, was cell density dependent. Moreover, a preliminary experiment suspending S. enterica cells into cell-free supernatants of L. helveticus previously exposed to an oxidative stress demonstrated that furanones A and B have a strong interspecific activity. In fact cell autolysis and cell envelope damages were observed with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in S. enterica.
TI  - Adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - Five Lactobacillus plantarum strains and two Lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from African traditionally fermented milk products or children's feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. The relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to HT29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the L. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to HT29 cells. Four L. plantarum and two L. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to HT29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. The two L. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the intestinal pathogens Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028. The L. plantarum BFE 1685 and L. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with HT29 cells in a strain-dependent way. These two potential probiotic strains also significantly increased interleukin-8 (IL-8) chemokine production by HT29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), did not occur. Altogether, our results suggested that L. plantarum BFE 1685 and L. johnsonii BFE 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.
TI  - Selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
AB  - Thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as Lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), Lactobacillus mucosae (7), Lactobacillus plantarum (6), Lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), Lactobacillus rossiae (2), Lactobacillus ultunensis (2), Lactobacillus crispatus (2), and Lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA. All isolates were detected at 8-9 log CFU g(-1). Preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees C for 10 s). The decrease in viability for some L. reuteri, L. mucosae, L. plantarum, L. kitasatonis, and L. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. Selected strains were further characterized for acid and bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. Except for L. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. Antibacterial activity was found against Gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. L. reuteri 8.1, 3S7, 6.2, and 1.2, L. mucosae 1.1R, L. plantarum 4.1, and L. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. After pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log CFU kg(-1) of lactobacilli. L. plantarum 4.1, and L. reuteri 3S7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, pH tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. The findings in this study provide a strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso.
AB  - A collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. Seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. The six selected strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rDNA sequencing, species-specific PCR and multiplex PCR of the recA gene. PCR amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in L. plantarum C11. Among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from this cluster.
TI  - Antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  - AIM: To develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus fermentum ME-3, Lactobacillus acidophilus La5, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v and Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12, Bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). Bacterial fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. Pyelonephritic Escherichia coli was highly suppressed by GG and both bifidobacteria strains. Lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and ME-3 were the most effective against Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while ME-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against Shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. Lact. paracasei, Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against Helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. The highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for Lact. fermentum ME-3 (P < 0.05). No efficient antagonist against Clostridium difficile was found. The positive correlations between the pH, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Screening Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.
TI  - Kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds.
AB  - Six Lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (L. acidophilus IBB 801, L. amylovorus DCE 471, L. casei Shirota, L. johnsonii La1, L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 and L. rhamnosus GG) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344. All lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this Gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like Caco-2/TC7 cells. By studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and pH control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. The antibacterial activity of L. acidophilus IBB 801, L. amylovorus DCE 471, L. casei Shirota and L. rhamnosus GG was solely due to the production of lactic acid. The antibacterial activity of L. johnsonii La1 and L. plantarum ACA-DC 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). The latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. In addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of Salmonella into Caco-2/TC7 cells.
TI  - Intestinal epithelial cells control dendritic cell function.
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) comprise a family of cells specializing in antigen capture  and presentation to T cells. We have recently shown that DC play an active role in bacterial uptake across mucosal surfaces. Indeed, DC are able to open tight junctions and to sample antigens directly across epithelia, both in vitro and in vivo. Because DC express tight junction proteins, the integrity of the epithelial barrier is preserved. In this study we have analyzed the possible involvement of epithelial cells in controlling DC function. We developed an in vitro model in our laboratory consisting of a three-player system of dendritic cells, epithelial cell monolayers, and bacteria. The crosstalk between epithelial cells and dendritic cells was analyzed, and epithelial cells were tested for their capacity to release cytokines and chemokines that induce the migration and activation of DC. We show that the capacity of epithelial cells to produce cytokines and activate DC is dependent on the invasiveness of the bacteria tested. In particular, invasive bacteria stimulate epithelial cells to release proinflammatory cytokines and to induce the maturation state of DC. By contrast, noninvasive bacteria are unable to stimulate epithelial cells, but can activate DC directly when DC translocate to the apical side. In conclusion, epithelial cells are not simply a barrier to bacteria entering via the oral route, but actively influence the activating properties of bystander DC.
TI  - Detection of low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  - Biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. An antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of Listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. The principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture Listeria cells on the fiber. Capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. A cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, C11E9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by launching a 635-nm laser light from an Analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. This immunosensor was specific for L. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other Listeria species or other microorganisms, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica, Lactobacillus plantarum, Carnobacterium gallinarum, Hafnia alvei, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. Fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. The sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) CFU/ml for a pure culture of L. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees C. When L. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees C with 3.5% NaCl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) CFU/ml, respectively. In less than 24 h, this method could detect L. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 CFU/g after enrichment in buffered Listeria enrichment broth.
TI  - Testing two Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus acidophilus strains for their suitability as a lipoid probiotic.
AB  - Two strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus T-135 and Lactobacillus plantarum 4/97) were selected in order to study their inhibitory properties against frequent udder pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Salmonella enteritidis and Bacillus pumilus), their production of organic acids as well as their ability to survive on the teat skin, the teat duct mucosa and in a lipoid emulsion. Both strains inhibited the tested pathogenic microbes and survived on the investigated surfaces and in an emulsion for more than 6 hours and 11 days, respectively.
TI  - Fermented liquid feed reduces susceptibility of broilers for Salmonella enteritidis.
AB  - The presence of Salmonella in chickens is a problem because poultry meat is recognized as a source of human salmonellosis. Fermented feed has characteristics like a high number of lactobacilli and high concentration of lactic acid, which could make chickens less susceptible for infection with Salmonella. Fermented feed might therefore prevent the colonization of chickens with Salmonella. Two studies were performed to quantify the effect of fermented liquid feed on the susceptibility of broilers for Salmonella. The fermented feed was prepared by fermenting a dry broiler feed supplemented with 1.4 parts of water. Lactobacillus plantarum was used for fermentation. The fermented liquid feed (FLF) contained 10(9) to 10(10) cfu lactobacilli per gram, and the pH was 4. Individually housed control chickens and FLF-fed chickens were inoculated with 10(2) to 10(7) cfu Salmonella enteritidis (SE). Colonization was estimated by cloacal swabs and quantitative caecal culture. The proportion of SE-shedding chickens was decreased in FLF-fed chickens. FLF-fed chickens required a longer time after inoculation or a higher inoculation dose to get the same proportion of infected chickens in comparison with dry feed-fed chickens. The level of cecal colonization with Salmonella in the ceca was not different at the end of the experimental period. The results indicate that FLF can hamper the introduction of Salmonella in broiler flocks because the chickens are less susceptible for infection. Fermented liquid feed might therefore be a new hurdle in the strategy to control Salmonella in chicken flocks.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of cucumber fruit through adhesion.
AB  - In this study, the adhesion of bacteria to fresh cucumber surfaces in aqueous suspension was shown to be dependent on time of incubation, inoculum species and concentration, and temperature. The adhesion of bacteria to the fruit in wash water was less extensive at lower temperatures and shorter exposure times. Various species of bacteria were adsorbed to cucumber surfaces in the following relative order: Salmonella Typhimurium > Staphylococcus aureus > Lactobacillus plantarum > Listeria monocytogenes. Cells were adsorbed at all temperatures tested (5, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C) at levels that depended on incubation time, but the numbers of cells adsorbed were larger at higher incubation temperatures. Levels of adhesion of bacteria to dewaxed fruit were higher for L. monocytogenes and lower for Salmonella Typhimurium, L. plantarum, and S. aureus than were levels of adhesion to waxed fruit.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation by high-pressure homogenisation and high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - The resistance of five gram-positive bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Listeria innocua and Leuconostoc dextranicum, and six gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas fluorescens and two strains of Escherichia coli, to high-pressure homogenisation (100-300 MPa) and to high hydrostatic pressure (200-400 MPa) was compared in this study. Within the group of gram-positive bacteria and within the group of gram-negative bacteria, large differences were observed in resistance to high hydrostatic pressure, but not to high-pressure homogenisation. All gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than any of the gram-negative bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation, while in relative to high hydrostatic pressure resistance both groups overlapped. Within the group of gram-negative bacteria, there also existed another order in resistance to high-pressure homogenisation than to high hydrostatic pressure. Further it appears that the mutant E. coli LMM1010, which is resistant to high hydrostatic pressure is not more resistant to high-pressure homogenisation than its parental strain MG1655. The preceding observations indicate a different response of the test bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation compared to high hydrostatic pressure treatment, which suggests that the underlying inactivation mechanisms for both techniques are different. Further, no sublethal injury could be observed upon high-pressure homogenisation of Y. enterocolitica and S. aureus cell population by using low pH (5.5 7), NaCl (0 6%) or SDS (0-100 mg/l) as selective components in the plating medium. Finally, it was observed that successive rounds of high-pressure homogenisation have an additive effect on viability reduction of Y. enterocolitica and S. aureus.
TI  - Effect of fermented feed on shedding of Enterobacteriaceae by fattening pigs.
AB  - Epidemiological studies showed that the use of fermented feed could significantly reduce Salmonella prevalence in pigs compared to the use of normal feed. Experimental challenge experiments with Salmonella have however never been conducted to reveal the efficacy of fermented feed in reducing Salmonella shedding and/or reducing the number of Salmonella-positive pigs. A longitudinal study was conducted to measure the effect of fermented feed, in particular of its components lactic acid and Lactobacillus plantarum, on gastrointestinal bacterial ecology (Salmonella, Enterobacteriaceae, lactobacilli, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), pH). Seeder pigs were used as a mode for Salmonella transmission within a pig herd. Bacteriological measurements were performed in faeces of the pigs. The results showed that fermented feed affected/reduced the Enterobacteriaceae population in faeces of the pigs. No differences were found in the number of positive pigs infected or in the number of shedding with Salmonella serovar Typhimurium fed fermented feed and between the normal feed group. S. serovar Goldcoast could not establish an infection in the seeder pigs in the fermented feed group as well as in the normal feed group. The pH of the faeces in the fermented feed groups was significantly higher than the pH of the faeces of the normal feed groups. The role of the undissociated form of the faecal VFAs on the significantly lower Enterobacteriaceae number in faeces of the pigs of the fermented feed groups could not be demonstrated because of the significant higher pH in the faeces of the pigs fed fermented feed.
TI  - Three glycoproteins with antimutagenic activity identified in Lactobacillus plantarum KLAB21.
AB  - Antimutagenic substances were purified from a culture supernatant of Lactobacillus plantarum KLAB21 cells isolated from kimchi, a Korean traditional fermented vegetable, and their characteristics were investigated. The antimutagenic substances were separated into two fractions by DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange column chromatography, which were designated the R1 and R2 fractions. The R1 fraction was then divided into two fractions again by Sephadex G200 gel filtration chromatography, and the fractions were designated R1-1 and R1-2. All three fractions were further purified using a Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration column. All the purified fractions were successfully stained with fuchsin as well as Coomassie brilliant blue, suggesting that they are glycoproteins. The purified fractions were confirmed to possess antimutagenic activity against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium TA100 cells. Their molecular masses were determined to be 16 (R1-1), 11 (R1-2), and 14 (R2) kDa on the Sepharose CL-6B column. Total sugar contents were 8.4% (R1-1), 7.3% (R1-2), and 9.4% (R2). The amino acid compositions of the fractions were different from each other; the major amino acids were glutamic acid (21.5%) and phenylalanine (17.1%) in the R1-1 fraction and glycine (41.3%) in the R1-2 fraction, but valine (31%) and phenylalanine (22.6%) were the major amino acids in the R2 fraction.
TI  - Identification of a non-haem catalase in Salmonella and its regulation by RpoS (sigmaS).
AB  - We report the identification and functional analysis of katN, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. katN, which is not present in Escherichia coli, is located between the yciGFE and yciD E. coli homologues in the Salmonella genome. Its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 Da and is similar to the Mn-catalases of Lactobacillus plantarum and Thermus spp. Its product, KatN, was visualized as a 37 kDa protein in E. coli maxicells. A KatN recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its C-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. KatN was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. Its expression was shown to be regulated by growth phase and rpoS. Northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream yciGFE genes. A putative rpoS-regulated promoter was identified upstream of yciG. Southern blotting revealed that katN is conserved within Salmonella serovars. katN homologues were found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. A katN mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) response of Salmonella. However, the expression of katN increased the H2O2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpoS mutants in stationary phase. Thus, KatN may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in Salmonella in certain environmental conditions.
TI  - Effect of elevated oxygen and carbon dioxide on the surface growth of vegetable-associated micro-organisms.
AB  - The impact of a novel type of Modified Atmosphere (MA), referred to as high O2-MA, on micro-organisms associated with the spoilage of minimally-processed vegetables was studied. Pure cultures of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter agglomerans, Aureobacterium strain 27, Candida guilliermondii, C. sake, Salmonella typhimurium, Salm. enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Leuconostoc mesenteroides var. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis were cultured on an agar-surface model system and incubated at 8 degrees C under an atmosphere composed of O2 (80 or 90%, balanced with N2), CO2 (10 or 20%, balanced with N2), or a combination of both gases. In general, exposure to high O2 alone did not inhibit microbial growth strongly, while CO2 alone reduced growth to some extent in most cases. Consistently strong inhibition was observed only when the two gases were used in combination. With minimally-processed vegetables, where CO2 levels of around 20% or above cannot be used because of physiological damage to the produce, the combined treatment of high O2 and 10-20% CO2 may provide adequate suppression of microbial growth, allowing a safe, prolonged shelf-life.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - QSARs for the effect of benzaldehydes on foodborne bacteria and the role of sulfhydryl groups as targets of their antibacterial activity.
AB  - Quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) were obtained describing the activity of a series of benzaldehydes against three different foodborne bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes F6861, serotype 4b, Salmonella enteritidis, Phage type 4, P167807 and Lactobacillus plantarum INT.L11. MIC values at pH 6.2 and 35 degrees C were obtained for 11 phenolic benzaldehydes to produce multiple linear regression and artificial neural network models. For each organism, the models contained a steric parameter Vw and an electronic-steric parameter for ortho substituents Es degree. The benzaldehydes did not require to partition to produce their effect, shown by the lack of a lipophilic parameter in the models. This strongly suggests that they act on the outside of the cells. Substitution ortho to the carbonyl group increased their antibacterial action. Cells were treated with 2,3-dihydroxy benzaldehyde and examined for their ability to bind radiolabelled iodoacetate to envelope sulfhydryl groups that remained available. It was shown that the accumulation of radiolabelled iodoacetate was lower after treatment, indicating possible competition between these two compounds for the same target. The order of the sensitivity to benzaldehydes (Salmonella > Listeria > Lactobacillus) correlated with the number of surface sulfhydryl groups available, being highest for Salmonella.
TI  - Anti-aflatoxigenic activity of Lactobacillus casei pseudoplantarum.
AB  - Lactobacillus casei pseudoplantarum 371 isolated from a silage inoculant was found to inhibit aflatoxins B1 and G1 biosynthesis by Aspergillus flavus subsp. parasiticus NRRI. 2999, in liquid medium. The inhibitory activity in the Lactobacillus cell-free supernatant was found to be sensitive to proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin, but resistant to pepsin. Lab-Lemco tryptone broth (LTB), supplemented with 20% of dialyzed protein concentrate of the supernatant, totally inhibited the production of aflatoxins B1 and G1. When the protein concentrate was digested with trypsin, the production of aflatoxins B1 and G1 was restored. The inhibitory activity of the supernatant was inactivated within 10 min at 100 degrees C. A. flavus grown in the Lactobacillus cell-free supernatant did not produce a mutagenic response in the Salmonella mutagenicity test. However, Lactobacillus casei pseudo plantarum 371 did not have an effect on aflatoxin production and mold growth as measured by ergosterol and plate count, when the organisms were inoculated together on sterile steamed rice.
TI  - The influence of Lactobacillus plantarum culture inoculation on the fate of Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium in Montasio cheese.
AB  - The growth and survival of Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium were  investigated during the manufacturing and ripening of raw milk Montasio cheese. Initial inoculated populations in the cheese milk were about 10(5) cfu/ml for S. aureus and 10(6) cfu/ml for S. typhimurium. Samples of curds and cheeses were taken during manufacturing and storage and analysed for pH and microbial populations. S. aureus increased slightly in number during the early period of ripening and attained a population of about 10(6) cfu/ml during the remaining period of storage. S. typhimurium decreased during cheesemaking and storage but persisted through 90 days. The addition of Lactobacillus plantarum culture (0.2% v/v) produced a marked reduction in populations of the test strains in 10 days of storage. Enterotoxin A was not detected in Montasio cheese even with a S. aureus population of 1.1 X 10(7) cfu/ml. L. plantarum strains were also tested by the spot method and the associative growth approach for their antagonistic activity against S. aureus and S. typhimurium. The compound excreted by L. plantarum was active only toward S. aureus. Furthermore, its activity was destroyed by protease treatment. These results indicated that while the growth of S. typhimurium is reduced by the acid production, S. aureus inhibition can be ascribed to bacteriocin production.
TI  - [Extraintestinal isolation of Salmonella in chickens: epidemiologic study of 3 salmonellosis outbreaks after ingestion of raw eggs].
AB  - A taxonomic analysis of the malolactic microflora present in nine grape samples from different zones of Galicia, was carried out. Nineteen strains were isolated and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (42%), L. brevis (10.6%), L. casei (5.25%), L. hilgardii (5.25%), Streptococcus cremoris (5.25%), Leuconostoc lactis (5.25%), L. oenos (10.6%), and Pediococcus acidilactici (15.8%).
TI  - Mutagenesis within the gastrointestinal tract determined by histidine auxotrophs  of Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The Ames Salmonella mutants can be maintained for months within the gastrointestinal tract of otherwise germfree rats. The ingestion of various carcinogens, but not structurally related non-carcinogens, results in an increased concentration of his+ revertants in the feces. Rats, associated with strain TA1538, were also associated with either L. plantarum of B. vulgatus and with both of these strains. After 2-nitrofluorene ingestion (3.4 mg) the concentration of fecal revertants increased except in rats associated only with strains TA1538 and B. vulgatus. The concentration of B. vulgatus. The concentration of B. vulgatus in the stomach of individual rats correlated negatively with their response to 2-nitrofluorene. Since only B. vulgatus reduces nitrofluorene to the less mutagenic 2-aminofluorene, it appears that B. vulgatus diminishes the revertant response by metabolic removal of the more potent direct acting mutagen from the gut. The ingestion of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (21 mg/kg) and azoxymethane (19 mg/kg) provokes increased fecal revertants only in some animals associated with strain TA1535 or TA100.
TI  - Properties of the Ames Salmonella mutants lodged in the gastrointestinal tract of gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - An association of the histidine auxotroph of Salmonella typhimurium (strain TA1538) within the gastrointestinal tract of otherwise germ-free Sprague-Dawley rats is maintained during observations for up to 7 months. The bacteria exceed concentrations of 10(7)/g in the forestomach and exceed concentrations of 10(8)/g in the lower bowel and feces. When carcinogens are ingested, the number of revertants in the feces increases. The ingestion of structurally related compounds which are not mutagenic to the bacteria in vitro and for which no evidence of carcinogenicity exists does not increase the number of revertants in the feces. The numbers of salmonella are increased by the addition of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacteroides fragilis but the salmonella disappear from the gastrointestinal tract when the rats are conventionalized. With the additional flora, there is a decrease in the number of revertants appearing in the feces in response to a given dose of carcinogen. This decrease may reflect an effect of the flora on the activity of the metabolic pathway responsible for the presence of the ultimate carcinogen or it may simply be an effect on the salmonella mutants themselves.
TI  - [Effect of lactic bacteria metabolic products on the transmission of R-plasmids in enterobacteria in vitro].
AB  - The authors present data on the study of lactobacteria used in the production of  dry lactobacterin (lactobacterinum siccum). Metabolic products (lactocidin) were extracted with lactic and acetic acid after Vincent et al. Two donor strains (E. coli K12 J5-3 R1-19 and E. coli K12 W1845 R26) were crossed in the conjugation process in various conbinations with six recipient strains (E. coli K12S, E. coli Su 3912/41, Sh. sonnei 263B, Sh. sonnel 3470, S. heidelberg, A161, and S. typhimurium SH3 his-). The frequency of R-plasmide transmission in enterobacteria was decreased in vitro under the effect of L. plantarum 8R-A3 and L. fermentum 90T-S4 metabolites.
TI  - The effects of additional flora on the response of salmonella mutants lodged in the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - A histidine auxotroph of Salmonella typhimurium, strain TA1538, will lodge for several months in the gastrointestinal tract of otherwise germ-free rats and of rats additionally associated with bacteria characteristic of the normal flora such as Lactobacillus plantarum and Bacteroides vulgatus. In the presence of the additional flora, the concentration of strain TA1538 is diminished in the stomach but not in the lower gastrointestinal tract or in the feces. Following the ingestion of 2-nitrofluorene, there is an increase in the concentration of revertants in the feces which reflects that observed in the colon and cecum. A dose-response relationship can be demonstrated between the amount of 2-nitrofluorene ingested and the concentration of revertants in the feces. A given dose of 2-nitrofluorene, however, produces fewer revertants in the feces of rats with the additional flora than in the feces of rats associated only with strain TA1538. It is not clear whether the decreased number of revertants in the feces in the presence of the additional flora is a result of metabolic transformations of 2-nitrofluorene by B. vulgatus, which can be demonstrated in vitro, or a result of the displacement of strain TA1538 from the stomach. The rat associated with strain TA1538, or other Ames tester strains, may be useful for detecting carcinogens as mutagens within the gastrointestinal tract and for determining the influence of various constituents of the bacterial flora on the concentration of mutagenic compounds.
