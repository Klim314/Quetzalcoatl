TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == the effect of glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro.
AB  == the use of glyphosate modifies the environment which stresses the living microorganisms. the aim of the present study was to determine the real impact of  glyphosate on potential pathogens and beneficial members of poultry microbiota in vitro. the presented results evidence that the highly pathogenic bacteria as salmonella entritidis, salmonella gallinarum, salmonella typhimurium, clostridium perfringens and clostridium botulinum are highly resistant to glyphosate. however, most of beneficial bacteria as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, bacillus badius, bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactobacillus spp. were found to be moderate to highly susceptible. also campylobacter spp. were found to be susceptible to glyphosate. a reduction of beneficial bacteria in the  gastrointestinal tract microbiota by ingestion of glyphosate could disturb the normal gut bacterial community. also, the toxicity of glyphosate to the most prevalent enterococcus spp. could be a significant predisposing factor that is associated with the increase in c. botulinum-mediated diseases by suppressing the antagonistic effect of these bacteria on clostridia.

TI  == distinct gut microbiota in southeastern african and northern european infants.
AB  == background and objective: the intestinal microbiota composition in infants reflects the early environment. our objective was to compare the gut microbiota in 6-month-old infants living in rural malawi with children of the same age living in urban finland, both being breast-fed and having an age-appropriate diet typical for each area. methods: malawian 6-month-old infants (n=44) were compared with finnish infants (n=31) of the same age. in both cohorts, infant stool samples were available for microbiota characterization by flow cytometry-fluorescent in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods. results: bifidobacteria were dominant at 6 months of age in all of the infants, although in greater proportions in malawian (70.8%) than in finnish infants (46.8%; p<0.001). additional distinctions in bacterial group composition comprised bacteroides-prevotella (17.2% vs 4.7%; p<0.001) and clostridium histolyticum (4.4% vs 2.8%; p=0.01), respectively. the species bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus  were absent in malawian but detected in finnish infants. conclusions: the gut microbiota of 6-month-old infants in a low-income country differs significantly from that in a high-income country. this may have an effect on both the energy harvest from the diet typifying malnutrition and diarrheal diseases in low-income countries and western lifestyle diseases in high-income countries.

TI  == coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  == coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. the aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and  ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. while 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less  common (4% incidence). coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from bacteroides fragilis with clostridium perfringens, and bifidobacterium adolescentis with c. perfringens. oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from b. adolescentis with fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii with c. perfringens and f. nucleatum with lactobacillus paracasei. heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.

TI  == selective growth-inhibiting effects of compounds identified in tabebuia impetiginosa inner bark on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid and lapachol identified in the inner bark of taheebo, tabebuia impetiginosa, toward 10 human intestinal bacteria was evaluated by using a paper disk diffusion bioassay and compared to those of seven lapachol congeners (1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin,  menadione, lawsone, plumbagin, juglone, and dichlone) as well as two commercially available antibiotics, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. these two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli at 100  microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis,  lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk. structure-activity relationships indicate that a methyl group in the c-2 position of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives might play an important role in antibacterial activity.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == evaluation of n-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == n-acetylchitooligosaccharides ((glcnac)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. a chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using hcl. after purification, the purity of each (glcnac)(1-6) was >86%. the growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (bm) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize glcnac and (glcnac)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium limosum could use (glcnac)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (glcnac)(1-6). glcnac was used more readily than (glcnac)(2-6) by staphylococcus  aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. in bm, streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.

TI  == selective responses of three ginkgo biloba leaf-derived constituents on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the selective responses of ginkgo biloba leaf-derived materials against six intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of bilobalide, ginkgolides a and b, kaempferol, and quercetin. the components of g. biloba leaves were characterized as kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside), kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6'  "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) by spectroscopic analysis. the growth  responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. at 2 mg/disk, kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) revealed potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside showed a clear inhibitory effect on escherichia coli. at 0.5 mg/disk, quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) showed a strong activity against c. perfringens, but weak activity was exhibited by kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) against c. perfringens and kaempferol  3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside against e. coli. no inhibition was observed from treatments conducted with bilobalide, ginkgolides a  and b, kaempferol, or quercetin. furthermore, these isolated compounds did not inhibit bifidobacterium bifidum, b. longum, b. adolescentis, or lactobacillus acidophilus.

TI  == adhesive property of bifidobacterium lactis lkm512 and predominant bacteria of intestinal microflora to human intestinal mucin.
AB  == the adhesive property to the intestinal mucin of bifidobacterium lactis lkm512, b. longum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, eubacterium aerofaciens, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus acidophilus were examined. adhesive rate of lkm512 to the mucin was significantly (p < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001) stronger than the other strains from 2 to 100 time. though the adhesive property  of many strains was almost same to the mucin of 20-year-old and 50-year-old generations, in case of 4-month-old was different. adhesive inhibitory effect of  c. perfringens to the mucin by lkm512 was examined. under the condition that lkm512 was 108/ml and that c. perfringens was 106/ml, adhesion of c. perfringens  to the mucin was inhibited at 99.6%, when lkm512 adhered in advance. there was the strong inhibition of adhesion at 74.0%, when c. perfringens adhered to mucin  in advance. thus, lkm512 can inhibit the adhesion of harmful bacteria to the intestinal mucin, the possibility of using as a probiotic strain has to be verified.

TI  == selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from pulsatilla cernua root.
AB  == among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an  impregnated paper disk method. the biologically active components of p. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. the activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity  against escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. weak  or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or lactobacillus acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in c. perfringens and e. coli as compared to b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. fragilis,  b. longum, or l. acidophilus. cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of p. cernua root.

TI  == cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
AB  == the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum. among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.

TI  == growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci in the rat colon.
AB  == the effect of intestinal bacteria on formation of azoxymethane (aom)-induced aberrant crypt foci (acf) and dna adducts in the rat colon was investigated. male sprague-dawley rats were administered cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens for five weeks and given injections of aom at 15 mg/kg body weight at the first and second weeks. the number of acf five weeks after the start of the experiment was decreased in the rats treated with the cultures or culture supernatants of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens. the half-life of o6-methylguanine (o6-meg) in the l. acidophilus group was shorter than that in the gam broth group. the half-life of 7-methylguanine did not differ among the groups. these results suggest that the metabolite(s) of l. acidophilus and c. perfringens inhibit(s) the acf formation in rats treated with aom and that the inhibitory effect of l. acidophilus is due to the enhanced removal of o6-meg from the colon mucosal dna.

TI  == growth stimulator for bifidobacteria produced by propionibacterium freudenreichii and several intestinal bacteria.
AB  == a bifidogenic growth stimulator was present in the cell-free filtrate of propionibacterium freudenreichii 7025 culture and in the methanol extract fraction of the cells. several intestinal bacteria, such as bacteroides, enterobacter, and enterococcus, which also released a growth stimulator for bifidobacteria, may play an important role in regulation of a bifidobacterial population in colonic microflora. the water-soluble stimulator from the methanol  extract of the cells was partially purified. the molecular weight of the stimulator appeared to be < 3000. the stimulatory activity was unaffected by treatments with pronase, carboxypeptidase a, ribonuclease, or nuclease p1 and was heat stable over a wide ph range. this stimulator differed from cyanocobalamin and from organic acids, such as acetate and propionate. because it was stable to  heat and proteolytic enzymes, the stimulator is a useful bifidogenic factor that  can reach the large intestine while retaining its activity. short-chain fatty acids were highly inhibitory to the growth of many intestinal bacteria, particularly gram-negative facultative and obligatory anaerobes. the short-chain  fatty acids (especially propionate) stimulated the growth of bifidobacteria. the  growth of bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003 was further enhanced in the presence  of short-chain fatty acids and the stimulator produced by p. freudenreichii 7025. viable counts of strain 6003 grown with bacteroides vulgatus jcm 5826t increased  more than 10(4) over those of the single culture of strain 6003. however, the growth of strain 6003 was inhibited in the mixed culture with clostridium perfringens 7028. in continuous culture, the growth of bifidobacterial strain 6003 could be greatly enhanced, even in the presence of clostridial strain 7028,  in media with short-chain fatty acids and stimulator produced by p. freudenreichii 7025.

TI  == the role of escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  == the growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus and bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (e. coli, ent. faecalis, b. ovatis, f. varium and c. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when  the e. coli strain was haemolytic. e. coli and b. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. when non-haemolytic e. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. the inclusion of partially purified e. coli haemolysin (125 hu50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic e. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. these results indicate that e. coli haemolysin is  one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between e. coli and b. ovatus, during abscess formation.

AB  == the fecal microflora of 15 healthy elderly persons with a median age of 84 years  in a rural area whose inhabitants tend to be long-lived (yuzurihara-area, uenohara, yamanashi prefecture) was compared with the microflora of individuals with a median age of 68 years in an urban area (tokyo). the diet of the elderly persons in the yuzurihara area is characterized by a high intake of dietary fiber. total numbers of anaerobic bacteria were significantly smaller in the elderly persons in the yuzurihara area than those in the tokyo area. a significantly large number of bifidobacteria, but not of lecithinase-negative clostridia, was observed in the elderly persons in the yuzurihara area. large numbers and high incidences of bacilli and lecithinase-positive clostridia (mainly clostridium perfringens) were found in the elderly persons in the tokyo area. twenty-five genera and over 81 species were isolated from the elderly persons in the yuzurihara area, and 25 genera and over 92 species were isolated from the elderly persons in the tokyo area. furthermore, significantly larger numbers of bifidobacterium adolescentis and fusobacterium mortiferum strains were found in the yuzurihara group, but significant reductions in the bacteroides buccae-oris group, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides spp., c. coccoides, c. paraputrificum, and clostridium spp. were observed in the same group. a significantly higher isolation rate of bacillus subtilis was observed in the elderly persons in the tokyo area. the difference in the fecal microflora between elderly persons in yuzurihara and those in the tokyo area might be due to a difference in the intake of dietary fiber.

TI  == effect of rice fiber on human fecal microflora.
AB  == the effects of brown rice, containing fourfold as much dietary fiber as polished  rice, on the human fecal microflora were determined. significantly increased numbers of bifidobacterium adolescentis and enterococcus faecalis were observed during the brown rice intake, whereas the total counts and the numbers of bacteroides, eubacterium aerofaciens, and escherichia coli during the intake were lower than those before and after the intake. lower numbers of clostridia and low incidences of clostridium paraputrificum and c. perfringens were observed during  the brown rice intake.

TI  == bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  == bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). the bifidobacterium spp. most frequently  isolated from the three groups of infants were b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum. the bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were  b. fragilis and b. vulgatus. the most common clostridium sp. in the three groups  of infants was c. perfringens. the type of milk did not select for species of bifidobacterium, bacteroides, or clostridium, except for clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. the species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic c3h/he  male mice.
AB  == the effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, c. paraputrificum, c. perfringens, c. innocuum, c. nexile, c. ramosum, c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides multiacidus, bacteroides fragilis, veillonella alcalescens, v. parvula, and lactobacillus acidophilus. the incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, and c. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). in contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, c. perfringens, and bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from  that in germfree animals (0.5). the present study demonstrated that the presence  of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.

TI  == [studies on the composition of the fecal flora of healthy dogs with the special references of lactobacillus flora and bifidobacterium flora (author's transl)].
AB  == with the new method the fecal flora of 13 clinically healthy dogs aged 3 to 42 months was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. it was characterized by that bacteroidaceae constituted the most prodominant flora, catenabacteria, streptococci, peptostreptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were the next most numerous, enterobacteria consisted the accompanying flora. the numbers of clostridium perfringens were remarkably fluctuated and seem to be influenced by the composition of the food ingested by the host. the total cultivable counts averaged log 10.8 +/- 0.2/g. the composition of the lactobacillus flora and bifidobacterium flora in the feces of 34 dogs from 3 different age groups was analysed. in the feces of all age groups l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. fermenti with 9 different types were found. within the lactobacilli l. acidophilus type vi c, l. salivarius type vi a and l. fermenti type iv b were most frequently found. l. acidophilus types vi c and xi, l. salivarius types vi a and vi b could not be placed in any established types of each species, and were described as new types. bifidobacteria were regularly found in large numbers in the feces of dogs aged 2 to 24 months. b. adolescentis and b. pseudolongum consisted the main bifidobacterium flora.
