TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == adhesion of inactivated probiotic strains to intestinal mucus.
AB  == it has been suggested that probiotics should be viable in order to elicit beneficial health effects. inactivation of probiotics has been suggested to interfere with the binding to the mucosa and thereby with the immune modulating activity of probiotics. the effect of different inactivation methods on the mucus adhesion of nine probiotic strains was studied. inactivation by heat or gamma-irradiation generally decreased the adhesive abilities. however, heat treatment increased the adhesion of propionibacterium freudenreichii and gamma-irradiation enhanced the adhesion of lactobacillus casei shirota. inactivation by u.v. was not observed to modulate the adhesion of the tested strains and it was concluded to be the most appropriate method for studying non-viable probiotics and preparing control products.

TI  == short-chain fatty acids modulate growth of lactobacilli in mixed culture fermentations with propionibacteria.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus (l. helveticus atcc 15009 and crl 581, and l casei lc 3) were paired with three strains of propionibacterium (p. freudenreichii ap8, p. freudenreichii gp6 and p. acidipropionici crl 756) and grown in individual and mixed cultures in a complex medium. bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption, and production of acids was determined and compared after mono and binary culture. propionibacterium strains were inhibited in mixed cultures that rapidly  reached low ph values, and stimulated in those with slow ph reduction. in several pairs lactobacillus strains were stimulated by mixed cultivation, while in others they were unaffected or inhibited. lactic acid reduction by propionibacterium consumption was not always enough to produce a stimulatory effect on growth of lactobacilli. the behaviour of lactobacillus strains in individual cultures in media with propionic acid was similar to that of mixed cultures with propionibacterium. as propionic acid concentration increased in the medium and glucose was consumed, both individual and mixed cultures of lactobacilli showed inhibition of the growth and increase of the fermentation activity.
