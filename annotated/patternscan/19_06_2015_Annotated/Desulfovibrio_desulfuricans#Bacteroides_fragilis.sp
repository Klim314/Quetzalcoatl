TI  == pcr-based detection of resistance genes in anaerobic bacteria isolated from intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == little information is available on the distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes in anaerobes in japan. to understand the background of antimicrobial resistance in anaerobes involved in intra-abdominal infections, we investigated the distribution of eight antimicrobial resistance genes (cepa, cfia, cfxa, ermf, ermb, mefa, tetq, and nim) and a mutation in the gyra gene in a total of 152 organisms (bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas spp., bilophila wadsworthia, desulfovibrio desulfuricans, veillonella spp., gram-positive cocci, and non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli) isolated between 2003 and 2004 in japan. the cepa gene was distributed primarily in bacteroides fragilis. gene cfxa was detected in about 9 % of the bacteroides isolates and 75 % of the prevotella spp. isolates and did not appear to contribute to cephamycin resistance. two strains of b. fragilis contained the metallo-beta-lactamase gene cfia, but they did not produce the protein product. gene tetq was detected in about 81, 44, and 63 % of b. fragilis isolates, other bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp. isolates, respectively. the ermf gene was detected in 25, 13, 56, 64, and 16 % of bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., fusobacterium spp., b. wadsworthia, and anaerobic cocci, respectively. gene mefa  was found in only 10 % of the b. fragilis strains and 3 % of the non-b. fragilis  strains. genes nim and ermb were not detected in any isolate. substitution at position 82 (ser to phe) in gyra was detected in b. fragilis isolates that were less susceptible or resistant to moxifloxacin. this study is the first report on  the distribution of resistance genes in anaerobes isolated from intra-abdominal infections in japan. we expect that the results might help in understanding the resistance mechanisms of specific anaerobes.

TI  == natural relationship between bacteroides and flavobacteria.
AB  == comparisons among 16s rrna sequences from various eubacteria reveal a natural relationship between the bacteroides (represented by the bacteroides fragilis sequence) and a phylogenetic unit that comprises the flavobacteria, cytophagae, flexibacteria, and others (represented by the flavobacterium heparinum sequence). although the relationship is not a close one, it is, nevertheless, specific. rrnas from these two organisms are not only closer to one another in overall sequence than they are to outgroup species (such as bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, desulfovibrio desulfuricans, and agrobacterium tumefaciens), but they show common idiosyncrasies (i.e., derived characteristics) in both rrna  sequences and higher-order structures.
