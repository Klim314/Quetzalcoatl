TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == [clinical studies on sulbactam/ampicillin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == during 8 months from october 1986 to may 1987, the clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) was evaluated in 63 pediatric inpatients with various infections. clinical efficacies were evaluable in 58 patients among them  (consisting of 2 patients with sepsis, 3 with tonsillitis, 12 with bronchitis, 6  with bronchopneumonia, 24 with pneumonia, 1 with phlegmon, 2 with lymphadenitis,  1 with impetigo and 7 with urinary tract infection) and were excellent in 40 patients and good in 17 with an overall efficacy rate of 98.3%. bacteriological efficacies were assessed in 25 patients and 27 strains of organisms (consisting of 3 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 2 streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 streptococcus pyogenes, 2 beta-streptococcus, 1 gram-positive cocci, 5 escherichia coli, 1 enterobacter aerogenes, 7 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 1 branhamella catarrhalis, 1 proteus mirabilis and 1  salmonella subgenus i). bacteriological eradication rates were 88.9% for gram-positive organisms, 66.7% for gram-negative organisms and 74.1% overall. no  superinfection was observed in any of patients treated. side effects and clinical laboratory parameter abnormalities observed consisted of diarrhea in 7 (11.1%) of the 63 patients, eosinophilia in 2 (3.3%) of 61 tested, thrombocytosis in 3 (5.5%) of 55, elevation of direct bilirubin in 1 (3.3%) of 30, elevation of total bilirubin in 1 (3.1%) of 32, elevation of got in 4 (6.8%) of 59 and elevation of  gpt in 1 (1.7%) of 59 patients tested. as an effect on the hemostatic mechanism of this drug, pivka ii was detected in 1 patient (4.2%) of 24 tested, but findings of other coagulation tests were normal and none of patients showed bleeding tendency or inhibition of platelet aggregation. from the above results,  it appears that sbt/abpc is an efficacious and safe drug in the treatment of bacterial infections of pediatric patients.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of 6059-s therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  == a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative, 6059-s, was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. twenty-five patients were treated with 10 to 274 mg/kg per day of 6059-s by intravenous administrations. the diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (2), pneumonia (4), pertussis (4), acute enterocolitis (2), recurrent urinary tract infection (2), suspected septicemia (3), and acute purulent meningitis (1); and the remaining 5  patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. the pathogens recovered were streptococcus pneumoniae (1), haemophilus influenzae (4), haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), enterobacter aerogenes (1), proteus morganii (1), psuedomonas aeruginosa (2) and salmonella typhimurium (1). all the  patients of bacterial infections were cured after the 6059-s therapy. however, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium were not eradicated after the 6059-s therapy, and the rate of bacterial disappearance was 75%. diarrhea (3), precordial pain (2, only in cases with high-dose therapy), transient elevation of got and gpt (2), and transient eosinophilia (2) were found to be associated with  the 6059-s therapy. however, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. half life of the serum 6059-s level was 1.34 +/- 0.16 hours. csf concentrations in a case with haemophilus influenzae meningitis ranged 4.0 to 9.7 mcg/ml after an intravenous injection of 34.3 to 75 mg/kg of 6059-s. from the present study, 6059-s appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections. it remains to be further determined whether 6059-s is superior to abpc in the treatment of haemophilus influenzae meningitis.

TI  == evaluation of the four-hour micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.
