TI  == the effect of a silage inoculant on silage quality, aerobic stability, and meat production on farm scale.
AB  == the effect of inoculation on nutrient content, fermentation, aerobic stability, and beef cattle performance for whole-plant corn silage treated with a commercial product (blend of homo- and heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, bsm, blend of enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus brevis, dsm numbers 3530, 19457, and 23231, resp.), was compared to a control treatment with  no silage additives (ct). the material had a dm of 323 g/kg, crude protein, and water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations of 87.9 and 110.5 g/kg dm, respectively. bsm increased the fermentation rate with a significantly deeper ph  (p < 0.01), a significant increase in the total organic acids concentration (p <  0.05), more lactic acid (p < 0.01), and numerically more acetic acid compared to  ct. bsm significantly decreased the concentrations of butyric acid (p < 0.01), ethanol, and ammonia-n compared to the ct. bsm-treated silage decreased dm by 3.0 % (p < 0.01) and had a higher digestible energy and a higher metabolizable energy concentration by 2.3 (p < 0.01) and 1.00 % (p < 0.05), respectively, compared to  untreated silage. aerobic stability improved by more than 2 days in bsm silage. the dm intake of silage treated with bsm increased by 6.14 %, and improved weight gain and the feed conversion by 8.0 (p < 0.01) and 3.4%.

TI  == characterization of two safe enterococcus strains producing enterocins isolated from egyptian dairy products.
AB  == five bacterial cocci isolates were selected from a wide pool of 503 isolates collected from traditional egyptian dairy products on the basis of their inhibitory activities against lactobacillus brevis f145, lactobacillus bulgaricus 340, enterococcus faecium hklhs, listeria ivanovii atcc, listeria innocua cip 80.11 and listeria monocytogenes egde 107776. these 5 isolates were identified as e. faecium tx1330 and e. faecium e980 by 16s rdna amplification and sequencing. the antibacterial activity of the two strains was not affected by treatment of the cell free culture supernatant with catalase but their activities disappeared  completely when digested with protease k, alpha-chymotrypsin and trypsin. the antimicrobial substance was stable over a wide range of ph (2-10) and was active  after heating at 100 degrees c for 10 min. bacteriocin yield in two strains reached a maximum (1,600 au/ml) at the end of the exponential phase (6 h) and remained stable until the end of 24 h-incubation period when the medium reached ph 5.5. maximal production of bacteriocin was obtained when growing the bacterial cells at temperatures ranging between 30 and 37 degrees c. bacteriocin production was unaffected when the bacterial cells grew under severe conditions of ph (9.6)  and in high salt (6.5% nacl). thanks to pcr gene amplification the bacteriocins produced by e. faecium tx1330 could be identified as enterocins a and b structural genes, while the bacteriocins produced by e. faecium e980 could be identified as enterocins p and l50a structural genes, which can be classified into two enterocin subclasses (iia and iic), respectively. pcr amplification demonstrated that the two studied strains did not contain virulence factors asal, cyl a and b, ace, efaafs and espfm. these two strains were sensitive to most of the tested antibiotics but were resistant to tetracycline. e. faecium e980 was also resistant to chloramphenicol.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == bacterial species associated with traditional starter cultures used for fermented bamboo shoot production in manipur state of india.
AB  == soidon is a non-salted acidic fermented food prepared from the succulent bamboo shoot tip of schizostachyum capitatum munro by using a traditional liquid starter called "soidon mahi" in manipur state of india. in this study, 163 bacterial isolates associated with this starter samples were identified and their population distribution was investigated by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), 16s rdna sequencing and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis. this acidic starter (ph 4.5+/-0.15) was dominated by a characteristic association of bacillus and lactic acid bacteria (lab) together. the population distribution of dominant species were bacillus subtilis 29.3%, bacillus cereus 35.7%, bacillus pumilus 2.6%, lactobacillus brevis 9.6%, lactobacillus plantarum 5.1%, carnobacterium sp. 11.9%, enterococcus faecium 1.2% and pseudomonas fluorescens 4.6%. alarming population load (10(6)-10(7)cfu/ml) of b. cereus in 87% of starter samples studied should raise concern regarding biosafety of soidon consumption. pcr amplification of 16s-23s rdna intergenic transcribed spacer (its) region and its-rflp profiles revealed a high diversity with eight subgroups in b. subtilis, five subgroups in b. cereus and three subgroups in l. brevis isolates. the most abundant b. subtilis subgroup ib.1 distributed in most of the samples showed very less clonal variability during rapd analysis. the molecular methods used in this study identified the dominant strains of bacillus and lab distributed in most of the starter samples. these dominant strains of b. subtilis, l. brevis and l. plantarum would allow for developing a defined starter culture for the production of quality soidon.

TI  == main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of ugandan ghee.
AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

TI  == inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western nigeria.
AB  == a total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from african indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by staphylococcus spp. (20%). the gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the staphylococcus spp.  showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. twenty-four lab isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. lab strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller  groups through amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). representative strains were identified as weissella spp., enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16s rdna. the weissella spp. and l. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity  against seven strains of gram negative uropathogens. two strains of l. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against lactobacillus sakei. in this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west nigeria was discovered.  based on their sensitivity to weissella spp., there is a potential for using these lab as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.

TI  == effect of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria starters on health-promoting and sensory properties of tomato juices.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus plantarum, weissella cibaria/confusa, lactobacillus brevis, pediococcus pentosaceous, lactobacillus sp. and enterococcus faecium/faecalis were identified from raw tomatoes by biolog system, partial 16s  rrna gene sequence and subjected to typing by random amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr) analysis. ten autochthonous strains were singly used to ferment tomato juice (tj) via a protocol which included fermentation at 25 degrees c for 17 h and further storage at 4 degrees c for 40 days. unstarted tj and tj fermented with an allochthonous strain of l. plantarum  were used as the controls. all autochthonous strains grew well in tj reaching cell densities ca. 10,000 and 10 times higher than unstarted tj and tj fermented  with the allochthonous strain. viscosity of tjs fermented with autochthonous strains was generally the highest, especially when started with w. cibaria/confusa which synthesized exo-polysaccharides. overall, unstarted tj and  tj fermented with the allochthonous strain showed marked decreases of ascorbic acid (asc), glutathione (gsh) and total antioxidant activity (tta) during storage. on the contrary, several tjs fermented with autochthonous strains, especially with l. plantarum pom1 and pom 35, maintained elevated values of asc,  gsh and taa. the variation of color indexes mirrored the above behavior. tjs fermented with the above two autochthonous strains were compared to controls based on volatile components through purge and trap or solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pt or spme-gc/ms) analysis. as shown by principal component analysis a large number of volatiles belonging to various chemical classes markedly differentiated tjs fermented with autochthonous strains with respect to controls.

TI  == biodiversity of the microbial community in a spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == the microbial diversity within alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the alpujarra mountains (granada, south-east spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community dna. a collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analyses. isolates on man-rogosa and sharpe-agar (mrs), m17-glucose agar and kenner fecal (kf)-agar medium were identified by specific pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. the predominant genus was lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of lb. plantarum and lb. brevis. other lactic-acid bacteria identified were pediococcus urinaequi, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuc. mesenteroides, lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci enterococcus faecium and e. devriesei. cluster analyses of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. the gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to hafnia alvei species. the microbes occurring in alberquilla cheese were also studied by pcr temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of the 16s rrna v3 region and partial 16s rrna sequencing of the ttge bands. the results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to lc. lactis, lb. paracasei, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. acidophilus and enterococcus sp. the non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as escherichia coli. all the enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaafm.  on the basis of their antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin b105 and mesenterocin y105, as revealed by pcr techniques.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china.
AB  == a total of 567 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from the stool samples of longevous people in regions of hotan, xinjiang and bama, guangxi, china. in order to reduce the number of strains for further examinations, 36 isolates were screened out for further examination whilst the other strains, which had lower probiotic properties, were not suitable for yogurt production due to the absence of growth in ph 3.5 mrs medium and no curding during fermentation, and so were excluded. the result of identification by api, sequence analysis of 16s rrna and random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis showed that there were three strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, 10 strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, three strains of lactobacillus casein, three strains of lactobacillus  brevis, two strains of enterococcus faecium, two strains of enterococcus faecalis, four strains of bifdibacterium infantis, three strains of bifdibacterium brevise, three strains of bifdibacterium bifidium, two strains of  bifdibacterium adolecentis and one strain of bifdibacterium longam among the 36 isolates. these strains were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to ph 2.0, 3.0 and/or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. the results presented here show that l. rhamnosus lv108, l.  rhamnosus f, b. brevise r39 and b. infantis r42 are acid and bile tolerant, adhere to the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cell line, antagonistic activity against potential pathogenic bacteria infection in vitro, and so are potential strains for probiotic use.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of enterococcus faecium l50, a strain producing enterocins l50 (l50a and l50b), p and q, against beer-spoilage lactic acid bacteria in broth, wort (hopped and unhopped), and alcoholic and non-alcoholic lager beers.
AB  == enterococcus faecium l50 produces enterocin l50 (l50a and l50b) (entl50, entl50a  and entl50b), enterocin p (entp) and enterocin q (entq) and displays a broad antimicrobial spectrum against the most relevant beer-spoilage lactic acid bacteria (lab) (i.e., lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus damnosus), which is mainly due to the production of entl50 (entl50a and entl50b). bacteriocin assays  using in vitro-synthesized entl50 (entl50a and entl50b) showed that both individual peptides possess antimicrobial activity on their own, entl50a being the most active, but when the two peptides were combined a synergistic effect was observed. the only virulence genes detected in e. faecium l50 were efaafm (cell wall adhesin) and ccf (sex pheromone), and this strain was susceptible to most clinically relevant antibiotics. e. faecium l50 survived but did not grow nor showed antimicrobial activity in hopped and unhopped wort, and alcoholic (1 and 5% ethanol, v/v) and non-alcoholic (0% ethanol, v/v) commercial lager beers. however, when unhopped wort was supplemented with 50% (v/v) mrs broth, e. faecium l50 grew and exerted antimicrobial activity similarly as in mrs broth. the enterocins produced by this strain were bactericidal (5 log decrease) against p.  damnosus and lb. brevis in a dose- and substrate-dependent manner when challenged in mrs broth, wort (hopped and unhopped), and alcoholic (1 and 5% ethanol, v/v) and non-alcoholic (0% ethanol, v/v) lager beers at 32 degrees c, and no bacterial resistances were detected even after incubation for 6-15 days. the enterocins in  wort and lager beer (5% ethanol, v/v) withstood the heat treatments commonly employed in the brewing industry during mashing, wort boiling, fermentation, and  pasteurization, and retained most of their antimicrobial activity in lager beer (5% ethanol, v/v) after long-term storage at 8 and 25 degrees c.

TI  == preliminary characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from zlatar cheese.
AB  == aims: isolation, characterization and identification of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from artisanal zlatar cheese during the ripening process and selection of strains with good technological characteristics. methods and results: characterization of lab was performed based on morphological, physiological and biochemical assays, as well as, by determining proteolytic activity and plasmid profile. rep-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis and 16s rdna sequencing were used for the identification of lab. pcr analysis was performed with specific primers for detection of the gene encoding nisin production. strains lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus  brevis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis were the main groups present in the zlatar cheese during ripening. conclusions: temporal changes in the species were observed during the zlatar cheese ripening. mesophilic lactobacilli are predominant microflora in zlatar cheese. significance and impact of the study: in this study we determined that zlatar cheese up to 30 days old could be used as a source of strains for the preparation of potential starter cultures in the process of industrial cheese production. as the serbian food market is adjusting to european union regulations, the standardization of zlatar cheese production by using starter culture(s) based on autochtonous well-characterized lab will enable the industrial production of this popular cheese in the future.

TI  == characterization of italian cheeses ripened under nonconventional conditions.
AB  == four italian cheeses (casciotta di urbino, barricato san martino, vento d'estate, and ubriaco di raboso) nonconventionally ripened under different plant materials  (walnut leaves, herbs, hay, and wine by-products, respectively) were compared for compositional, microbiological, biochemical, and volatile profile characteristics. mean values for gross composition were rather similar. because primary starters were not used for manufacture, the endogenous lactic acid bacteria were mainly present (7.0 to 9.0 log10 cfu/g). except for lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides, which were commonly identified in 3 cheeses, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus sanguinicola, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus durans/enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella  cibaria/weissella confusa were variously found in the 4 cheeses. random amplification of polymorphic dna-pcr analysis showed the biodiversity among the strains, and the species of lactobacilli were in part grouped according to their  origin. as shown by the principal component analysis of reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography data for the ph 4.6-soluble fractions and by the determination of free aa, the secondary proteolysis of barricato san martino and  vento d'estate mainly differed from the other 2 cheeses. purge-and-trap and solid-phase microextraction were coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine volatile compounds. vento d'estate showed the highest levels of almost all chemical classes, and casciotta di urbino was characterized  by a very low level of volatile components. esters, ketones, and terpenes were the chemical classes that mainly differentiated the cheeses. several volatile compounds seemed to be released directly from the plant materials used for ripening, especially terpenes for vento d'estate cheese. the lowest level of volatile free fatty acids was found in casciotta d'urbino, in which rennet paste  was not used during manufacture. the highest concentration of free fatty acids, especially butyric and caproic acids, was found in vento d'estate cheese.

TI  == characterization of microflora in homemade semi-hard white zlatar cheese.
AB  == the zlatar cheese belongs to the group of traditionally homemade cheeses, which are produced from nonpasteurized cow's milk, without adding of any bacterial starter culture. changes were followed in lactic acid bacteria population and chemical composition during the ripening period of cheese up to 60 days. results  showed that the percentage of lactic acid cocci was higher in raw milk and one day old cheese and their percentage was gradually decreasing, whereas the number  of lactobacilli was increasing. after 30 days of cheese ripening the number of cocci increased again, reaching the number of lactobacilli. the results of api 50 ch system and rep-pcr analysis showed that lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, enterococcuus  faecium and enterococcus faecalis were the main groups present during the ripening of zlatar cheese. results revealed that in older cheeses (45 and 60 days old) enterococci were the main group present. it was also demonstrated that 57 isolates showed antimicrobial activity. the number of bacteria showing antimicrobial activity slowly decreased during the ripening period and in samples of 60 days old cheese producers of antimicrobial activities were not detected.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == a multifactorial design for studying factors influencing growth and tyramine production of the lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus brevis cect 4669 and enterococcus faecium bifi-58.
AB  == a central composite face design was used to study growth and tyramine production  of two strains of lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus brevis cect 4669 and enterococcus faecium bifi-58. the effects of five physicochemical factors (incubation temperature and time, environmental ph, added tyrosine concentration, and pyridoxal-5-phosphate (plp) supplementation) on cell growth and tyramine production were analyzed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the parameters of the quadratic model for each response variable were estimated by multiple linear regression (mlr), and statistical analysis of the results led to the elucidation of mathematical models capable of predicting the behavior of the responses as a function of the main variables involved in the process. incubation time was found to be the most important variable influencing growth in l. brevis, while ph showed the highest contribution in e. faecium. the production of tyramine was dependent on the added tyrosine concentration and incubation time. the proposed mlr model predicted the optimum conditions that gave maximum responses for l. brevis and e. faecium growth and tyramine production. in both strains, this model predicted that the anaerobic condition at acidic ph (4.4) in  the presence of a high tyrosine concentration favors tyramine production.

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

AB  == real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to quantify seven species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in alfalfa silage prepared in the presence or absence of four commercial inoculants and in uninoculated corn stover harvested and stored under a variety of field conditions. species-specific pcr primers were designed based on reca gene sequences. commercial inoculants improved the quality of alfalfa silage, but species corresponding to those in the inoculants displayed variations in persistence over the next 96 h. lactobacillus brevis was the most abundant lab (12 to 32% of total sample dna) in all of the alfalfa silages by 96  h. modest populations (up to 10%) of lactobacillus plantarum were also observed in inoculated silages. pediococcus pentosaceus populations increased over time but did not exceed 2% of the total. small populations (0.1 to 1%) of lactobacillus buchneri and lactococcus lactis were observed in all silages, while lactobacillus pentosus and enterococcus faecium were near or below detection limits. corn stover generally displayed higher populations of l. plantarum and l. brevis and lower populations of other lab species. the data illustrate the utility of rt-pcr for quantifying individual species of lab in conserved forages  prepared under a wide variety of conditions.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == lactobacillus casei, dominant species in naturally fermented sicilian green olives.
AB  == this study investigated the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria in naturally fermented green olives, collected from different areas of sicily. both classical biochemical tests and pcr/restriction fragments length  polymorphism (rflp) of 16s rdna were used to characterize the isolates. the identity of the isolates was obtained by the partial sequencing analysis of the 16s rdna. the biomerieux software assigned the 13 heterofermentative strains to the lactobacillus brevis species; 24 homofermentative strains were classified as  lactobacillus casei and the remaining 11 homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as lactobacillus plantarum. the rapid id 32 strep test identified coccal-shaped strains as enterococcus faecium species. the pcr/rflp analysis showed a remarkable bacterial heterogeneity within the isolates. the 16s rdna partial sequencing did not confirm biochemical identification, revealing a strong dominance of isolates belonging to the l. casei species. it is noteworthy that this species has never been reported as dominant species in fermented vegetables.a combination of molecular and biochemical analysis allowed the identification of species involved in natural food fermentations.

TI  == the tyrosine decarboxylase operon of lactobacillus brevis ioeb 9809: characterization and conservation in tyramine-producing bacteria.
AB  == bacterial genes of tyrosine decarboxylases were recently identified. here we continued the sequencing of the tyrosine decarboxylase locus of lactobacillus brevis ioeb 9809 and determined a total of 7979 bp. the sequence contained four complete genes encoding a tyrosyl-trna synthetase, the tyrosine decarboxylase, a  probable tyrosine permease and a na+/h+ antiporter. rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) was employed to determine the 5'-end of mrnas containing the tyrosine decarboxylase gene. it was located only 34-35 nucleotides upstream of the start codon, suggesting that the preceding tyrosyl-trna synthetase gene was transcribed separately. in contrast, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (rt-pcrs) carried out with primers designed to amplify regions spanning gene junctions showed that some mrnas contained the four genes. homology searches revealed similar clusters of four genes in the genome sequences of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. phylogenetic analyses supported the hypothesis that these genes evolved all together. these data suggest that bacterial tyrosine decarboxylases are encoded in an operon containing four genes.

TI  == construction and use of a computerized dna fingerprint database for lactic acid bacteria from silage.
AB  == efficient selection of new silage inoculant strains from a collection of over 10,000 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (lab) requires excellent strain discrimination. toward that end, we constructed a gelcompar ii database of dna fingerprint patterns of ethidium bromide-stained ecori fragments of total lab dna separated by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. we found that the total dna patterns were strain-specific; 56/60 american type culture collection strains of 33 species of lab could be distinguished. enterococcus faecium strains atcc19434 and atcc35667 had identical total dna patterns and riboprints. lactobacillus rhamnosus strains atcc7469 and atcc27773 also had identical total dna patterns, but different riboprints. ecori riboprint patterns could distinguish only about 9/23 lactobacillus plantarum strains and about 6/10 lactobacillus buchneri strains, whereas all 33 strains could be distinguished by  ecori total dna patterns. despite gel-to-gel variation, new dna patterns can be readily grouped with existing patterns using gelcompar ii. the database contains  large homogenous clusters of l. plantarum, e. faecium, l. buchneri, lactobacillus brevis and pediococcus species that can be used for tentative taxonomic assignment. we routinely use the dna fingerprint database to identify and characterize new strains, eliminate duplicate isolates and for quality control of inoculant product strains. the gelcompar ii database has been in continuous use for 7 years and contains more than 3600 patterns representing approximately 700 unique patterns from over 300 gels and is the largest computerized dna fingerprint database for lab yet reported.

TI  == typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic dna amplification.
AB  == in this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices)  were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. the tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus.  both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of bacillus  pumilus, 3 isolates of enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates  of escherichia coli, 8 isolates of lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus. amplified dna fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. a total of 62 distinct rapd types were categorized from the five genera studied. typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus in three patient pairs. genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.

TI  == on the microbiological profile of traditional portuguese sourdough.
AB  == traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. to this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. more than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via biomerieux api galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. the dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequently isolated yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida pelliculosa. the most frequently isolated lab were (heterofermentative) leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) lactobacillus spp.; l. brevis, l. curvatus, and l. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the lactobacillus genera; lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; enterococcus casseliflavus, e. durans, and e. faecium for enterococci; and streptococcus constellantus and s. equinus for streptococci.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.

TI  == sugar uptake and involved enzymatic activities by yeasts and lactic acid bacteria: their relationship with breadmaking quality.
AB  == the uptake kinetics of sugars present in wheat doughs and alpha-glucosidase as well as beta-fructosidase activities were determined in different strains of yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. these strains were previously selected according to their breadmaking quality. saccharomyces cerevisiae (p6), candida guilliermondii (p40), lactobacillus plantarum (b31 and la18) and l. brevis (b21)  showed good performance, while sacch. fructuum (p43), l. cellobiosus (b37) and enterococcus faecium (b11) yielded bread of lower quality. leuconostoc mesenteroides (b10), when used in combination with other strains led also to high quality starters. all yeast strains used assimilated glucose, fructose and maltose, exhibiting saturable kinetics. lactic acid bacteria showed saturable kinetics only for hexoses, whereas disaccharide uptake was linear. sacch. cerevisiae, leuconostoc mesenteroides, l. brevis and l. plantarum (b31) displayed better sugar uptake properties. for all the strains used alpha-glucosidase and beta-fructosidase activities were detected. the highest specific activities were  found for sacch. cerevisiae, c. guilliermondii and l. plantarum (b31). these results indicate good correlation between the parameters evaluated and the breadmaking potential of the microorganisms.

TI  == effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth (bbl). some of the effectors, e.g., streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, lactobacillus lactis, l. brevis, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of s. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most  cultures were inhibitory, and some (s. faecium and l. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the staphylococcus. low-temperature meat lactobacilli and leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited s. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 c throughout its growth. streptococcus  faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 c, as well. when the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat lactobacillus, and l. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 c, and all but the meat lactobacillus did so at 22 c. a ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 c, except that s. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by s. faecalis. a ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. in general, the more effector bacteria there were  in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of s. aureus. inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 c, less so at 20 or 25 c, and least at 30 or 37 c, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of s. aureus were similar, for the most part.
