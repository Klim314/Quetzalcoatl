TI  - Tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to chlorinated solvents.
AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of four chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs), perchloroethene (PCE), carbon tetrachloride (CT), chloroform (CF) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), on the growth of eight anaerobic bacteria: four fermentative species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Clostridium sp. and Paenibacillus sp.) and four respiring species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Shewanella oneidensis and Desulfovibrio vulgaris). Effective concentrations of solvents which inhibited growth rates by 50% (EC50) were determined. The octanol-water partition coefficient or log Po/w of a CAH proved a generally satisfactory measure of its toxicity. Most species tolerated approximately 3-fold and 10-fold higher concentrations of the two relatively more polar CAHs CF and 1,2-DCA, respectively, than the two relatively less polar compounds PCE and CT. EC50 values correlated well with growth rates observed in solvent-free cultures, with fast-growing organisms displaying higher tolerance levels. Overall, fermentative bacteria were more tolerant to CAHs than respiring species, with iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in particular appearing highly sensitive to CAHs. These data extend the current understanding of the impact of CAHs on a range of anaerobic bacteria, which will benefit the field of bioremediation.
TI  - Microfluidic fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry (muFlowFISH).
AB  - We describe an integrated microfluidic device (muFlowFISH) capable of performing  16S rRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) followed by flow cytometric detection for identifying bacteria in natural microbial communities. The device was used for detection of species involved in bioremediation of Cr(vi) and other metals in groundwater samples from a highly-contaminated environmental site (Hanford, WA, USA). The muFlowFISH seamlessly integrates two components: a hybridization chamber formed between two photopolymerized membranes, where cells and probes are electrophoretically loaded, incubated and washed, and a downstream cross structure for electrokinetically focusing cells into a single-file flow for flow cytometry analysis. The device is capable of analyzing a wide variety of bacteria including aerobic, facultative and anaerobic bacteria and was initially tested and validated using cultured microbes, including Escherichia coli, as well as two strains isolated from Hanford site: Desulfovibrio vulgaris strain RCH1, and Pseudomonas sp.strain RCH2 that are involved in Cr(vi) reduction and immobilization. Combined labeling and detection efficiencies of 74-97% were observed in experiments with simple mixtures of cultured cells, confirming specific labeling. Results obtained were in excellent agreement with those obtained by conventional flow cytometry confirming the accuracy of muFlowFISH. Finally, the device was used for analyzing water samples collected on different dates from the Hanford site. We were able to monitor the numbers of Pseudomonas sp. with only 100-200 cells loaded into the microchip. The muFlowFISH approach provides an automated platform for quantitative detection of microbial cells from complex samples, and is ideally suited for analysis of precious samples with low cell numbers such as those found at extreme environmental niches, bioremediation sites, and the human microbiome.
TI  - Desulfovibrio desulfuricans PglB homolog possesses oligosaccharyltransferase activity with relaxed glycan specificity and distinct protein acceptor sequence requirements.
AB  - Oligosaccharyltransferases (OTases) are responsible for the transfer of carbohydrates from lipid carriers to acceptor proteins and are present in all domains of life. In bacteria, the most studied member of this family is PglB from Campylobacter jejuni (PglB(Cj)). This enzyme is functional in Escherichia coli and, contrary to its eukaryotic counterparts, has the ability to transfer a variety of oligo- and polysaccharides to protein carriers in vivo. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that in the delta proteobacteria Desulfovibrio sp., the PglB homolog is more closely related to eukaryotic and archaeal OTases than to its Campylobacter counterparts. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of a putative operon that might encode all enzymes required for N-glycosylation in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. D. desulfuricans PglB (PglB(Dd)) was cloned and successfully expressed in E. coli, and its activity was confirmed by transferring the C. jejuni heptasaccharide onto the model protein acceptor AcrA. In contrast to PglB(Cj), which adds two glycan chains to AcrA, a single oligosaccharide was attached to the protein by PglB(Dd). Site-directed mutagenesis of the five putative N-X-S/T glycosylation sites in AcrA and mass spectrometry analysis showed that PglB(Dd) does not recognize the "conventional bacterial glycosylation sequon" consisting of the sequence D/E-X(1)-N-X(2)-S/T (where X(1) and X(2) are any amino acid except proline), and instead used a different site for the attachment of the oligosaccharide than PglB(Cj.). Furthermore, PglB(Dd) exhibited relaxed glycan specificity, being able to transfer mono- and polysaccharides to AcrA. Our analysis constitutes the first characterization of an OTase from delta-proteobacteria involved in N-linked protein glycosylation.
TI  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) accumulation in sulfate-reducing bacteria and identification of a class III PHA synthase (PhaEC) in Desulfococcus multivorans.
AB  - Seven strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were tested for the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). During growth with benzoate Desulfonema magnum accumulated large amounts of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [poly(3HB)]. Desulfosarcina variabilis (during growth with benzoate), Desulfobotulus sapovorans (during growth with caproate), and Desulfobacterium autotrophicum (during growth with caproate) accumulated poly(3HB) that accounted for 20 to 43% of cell dry matter. Desulfobotulus sapovorans and Desulfobacterium autotrophicum also synthesized copolyesters consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyvalerate when valerate was used as the growth substrate. Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Desulfotalea psychrophila were the only SRB tested in which PHAs were not detected. When total DNA isolated from Desulfococcus multivorans and specific primers deduced from highly conserved regions of known PHA synthases (PhaC) were used, a PCR product homologous to the central region of class III PHA synthases was obtained. The complete pha locus of Desulfococcus multivorans was subsequently obtained by inverse PCR, and it contained adjacent phaE(Dm) and phaC(Dm) genes. PhaC(Dm) and PhaE(Dm) were composed of 371 and 306 amino acid residues and showed up to 49 or 23% amino acid identity to the corresponding subunits of other class III PHA synthases. Constructs of phaC(Dm) alone (pBBRMCS-2::phaC(Dm)) and of phaE(Dm)C(Dm) (pBBRMCS-2::phaE(Dm)C(Dm)) in various vectors were obtained and transferred to several strains of Escherichia coli, as well as to the PHA-negative mutants PHB(-)4 and GPp104 of Ralstonia eutropha and Pseudomonas putida, respectively. In cells of the recombinant strains harboring phaE(Dm)C(Dm) small but significant amounts (up to 1.7% of cell dry matter) of poly(3HB) and of PHA synthase activity (up to 1.5 U/mg protein) were detected. This indicated that the cloned genes encode functionally active proteins. Hybrid synthases consisting of PhaC(Dm) and PhaE of Thiococcus pfennigii or Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6308 were also constructed and were shown to be functionally active.
TI  - Substrate recognition by 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase from Sulfolobus sp.  strain 7.
AB  - 2-Oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (OFOR) catalyzes the coenzyme A-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxoacids, at an analogous metabolic position to 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complex. The enzyme from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7, a thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon, is a heterodimer comprising two subunits, a (632 amino acids) and b (305 amino acids). In contrast to other OFORs, the Sulfolobus enzyme shows a broad specificity for 2-oxoacids such as pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate. Based on careful multiple alignment of this enzyme family and on the reported three-dimensional structure of the homodimeric pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR) from Desulfovibrio africanus, we selected five amino acids, T256, R344 and T353 of subunit-a, and K49 and L123 of subunit-b, as candidate 2-oxoacid recognizing residues. To identify the residues determining the 2-oxoacid specificity of the enzyme family, we performed point mutations of these five amino acids, and characterized the resulting mutants. Analyses of the mutants revealed that R344 of subunit-a of the enzyme was essential for the activity, and that K49R and L123N of subunit-b drastically affected the enzyme specificity for pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate, respectively. Replacement of the five residues resulted in significant changes in both K(m) and V(max), indicating that these amino acids are clearly involved in substrate recognition and catalysis.
TI  - Role of a highly conserved YPITP motif in 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase: heterologous expression of the gene from Sulfolobus sp.strain 7, and characterization of the recombinant and variant enzymes.
AB  - 2-Oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7, an aerobic and  thermoacidophilic crenoarchaeon, catalyses the coenzyme A-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate, a cognate Zn-7Fe-ferredoxin serving as an electron acceptor. It comprises two subunits, a (632 amino acids) and b (305 amino acids). To further elucidate its structure and function, we constructed a gene expression system. The wild-type recombinant enzyme was indistinguishable from the natural one in every criterion investigated. A series of variants was constructed to elucidate the role of the YPITP-motif (residues 253-257) in subunit a, which is conserved universally in the 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (OFOR) family. Single amino-acid replacements at Y253 and P257 by other amino acids caused a drastic loss of enzyme activity. T256, the hydroxyl group of which has been proposed to be essential for binding of the 2-oxo group of the substrate in the Desulfovibrio africanus enzyme, was unexpectedly replaceable with Ala, the kcat and Km for 2-oxoglutarate being approximately 33% and approximately 51%, respectively, as compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. Replacement at other positions resulted in a significant decrease in the kcat of the reaction while the Km for 2-oxoacid was only slightly affected. Thus, the YPITP-motif is essential for the turnover of the reaction rather than the affinity toward 2-oxoacid.
TI  - Evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
AB  - Entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR), ferredoxin (FD), and alcohol dehydrogenase E (ADHE). The goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic E. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for E. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. In this study, the E. histolytica por gene and the adhE gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, Giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to POR, ADHE, and FD cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. The E. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. The predicted E. histolytica POR showed fewer positional identities to the POR of G. lamblia (34%) than to the POR of the enterobacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its POR to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. Maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely E. histolytica POR sharing more recent common ancestry with G. lamblia POR than with POR of bacteria and the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome. The G. lamblia adhE encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) ADH at its carboxy half. The predicted G. lamblia ADHE showed extensive positional identities to ADHE of Escherichia coli (49%), Clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and E. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 ADH of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). Phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the E. histolytica ADHE to bacterial ADHE than to the G. lamblia ADHE. The 6-kDa FD of E. histolytica and G. lamblia were most similar to those of the archaebacterium Methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kDa FD of the T. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kDa FD of gamma-purple bacterium Pseudomonas putida. E. histolytica genes (and probably G. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. These are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
TI  - [Isolation and reassociation of acetogen and methanogen in a syntrophobic coculture degrading butyrate anaerobically].
AB  - Anaerobic coculture BF2 which degraded butyrate into acetate and produced methane was isolated from granular methanogenic sludge. The coculture is associated syntrophically the Syntrophomonas subsp. saponavida strain CF2 with Methanobacterium formicicum strain MF2 and appeared to degraded C4 approximately C18 fatty acids including isobutyrate. The optimal temperature and pH for growth was 37 degrees C and 7.7 respectively. The strain CF2 was obtained in pure culture with crotonate as substrate and produces acetate and butyrate. The doubling time of strain CF2 in crotonate media was about 20 hours. Strain CF2 is Gram negative, slightly curved 0.2 approximately 0.3 x 2.0 approximately 3.0 micron with round ends, motile by lateral flagellation at the concave side, non sporeforming. With a hydrogen scavenging organism, such as Methanospillum hungatei JF1, Methanobacterium formicicum 1535, Methanobrevibacterium bryantii 1125 and Desulfovibrio sp. B11, the strain CF2 paired up and the defined coculture degraded butyrate to acetate. When the strain CF2 associated with the original accompanist, Methanobacterium formicius strain MF2, the reassociated couculture degraded butyrate to acetate and produced methane again.
TI  - Dimethyl sulfoxide as an electron acceptor for anaerobic growth.
AB  - The isolation from lake mud of a bacterium which can use dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an electron acceptor for growth is described. The isolate, called strain DL-1, was a small, gram negative, non-motile spiral. The sole product of DMSO reduction was dimethyl sulfide (DMS). Other electron acceptors used by the isolate included sulfite, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, methionine sulfoxide, tetramethylene sulfoxide, nitrate, and oxygen (microaerophilically). Sulfate was not reduced and could not even be assimilated. Lactate or succinate could serve as electron donors, with acetate as the main product. Hydrogen could be used as an electron donor if acetate was present in the medium as a carbon source. The organism has a c-type cytochrome, and most likely uses electron transport phosphorylation during DMSO reduction. Cultures of Desulfovibrio sp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris were tested for growth using DMSO as an electron acceptor, and only the Proteus strain grew. Both Proteus and strain DL-1 are versatile at coupling reductions with energy generation. There is a marked resemblance between strain DL-1 and the recently described sulfur-reducing spirillum of Wolfe and Pfennig.
