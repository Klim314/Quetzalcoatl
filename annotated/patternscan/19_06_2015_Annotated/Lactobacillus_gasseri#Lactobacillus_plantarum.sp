TI  == characterization of the adhesive factors of selected probiotics to caco-2 epithelium cell line.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyse the type of adhesive factors of selected probiotic strains. a large number of lactic acid bacteria with intestinal and dairy origin were collected and assessed for adhesion on caco-2 cell line. from the best adherent bacteria, four strains were selected for further research: lactobacillus gasseri g7, l. plantarum f1, l. helveticus ac and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b14. the average number of adhered bacteria was  17 per one caco-2 cell in the case of l. gasseri g7 and 21 per cell in the case of l. plantarum f1. treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta), trypsin and metaperiodic acid in separate assays revealed that cell-bonded extracellular proteins were responsible for the adhesion of the selected l. gasseri, l. plantarum and l. helveticus strains, in contrast to the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain, whose adhesive factors were identified as cell-bonded exopolysaccharides. the cell-wall proteins from the first three strains were isolated, fractionated and assessed for adhesion to caco-2 cells. based on the attachment properties of the purified proteins towards caco-2 cells, it was clearly proved exactly which proteins are involved in the adherence. l. plantarum f1 strain contains two adhesive proteins in contrast to the other selected strains containing one adhesive protein each. the determination of the factors mediating the adhesive abilities of the selected strains provides important information about the possible ways to preserve and increase adhesive properties towards epithelium cells.

TI  == the use of pfge method in genotyping of selected bacteria species of the lactobacillus genus.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus are a group of microorganisms in which there are numerous strains with high probiotic potential. in recent years,  interest in probiotics as nutritional supplements and as drugs has significantly  increased. in order to carry out research on probiotic bacterial strains, their beneficial effects on the human body should be confirmed and molecular typing should be carried out with the aim of marking a specific strain. pulse-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) is the reference method employed for bacterial genotyping, but it is commonly used for typing mainly pathogenic bacteria. the following study describes a way of performing pfge analysis in genotyping of bacteria species belonging to the genus lactobacillus: l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. plantarum and l. rhamnosus.

TI  == vaginal lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 can inhibit herpes simplex type 2 but not coxsackievirus b4e2.
AB  == this study aimed at demonstrating the antiviral activity of lactobacillus gasseri cmul57 (l. gasseri cmul57), l. acidophilus cmul67 and l. plantarum cmul140 against herpes simplex type 2 (hsv-2) and coxsackievirus b4e2 (cvb4e2), which are enveloped and naked viruses, respectively. these lactobacilli were non-cytotoxic  and were able to reduce the cytopathic effect induced by hsv-2 in vero cell monolayers. however, lactobacilli were not active against cvb4e2. tested lactobacilli displayed anti-hsv-2 activity when they were co-incubated with the virus prior to inoculating the mixture to vero cell monolayers. the detection of  hsv-2 dna by pcr in pellets of bacteria/virus mixtures let us to hypothesize that anti-hsv-2 activity of lactobacilli resulted from the viruses' entrapment. this study showed the capabilities of vaginal lactobacilli to inhibit enveloped viruses such as hsv-2.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli from deep carious lesions by means of species-specific pcr and maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to compare maldi-tof results for the identification of 87 lactobacilli, isolated from soft or hard carious dentin from 70 first molars of 7- to 8-year-old children with those obtained by species-specific pcr. methods: the 87 isolates were analyzed by maldi-tof ms (microflex lt, maldi biotyper 3.0, bruker daltonik, bremen, germany), using a reference data base of 4110 strains including > 90 lactobacillus species. for the identification with species-specific pcr, oligonucleotide primers (16s rrna) specific for l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri, l. plantarum, and  l. acidophilus were used; type strains served as controls. the pcr-products were  separated electrophoretically on a 1.5% agarose gel and identified by their position on the gel. results: for 93% of the strains both methods produced concordant results: 40 strains were identified as l. rhamnosus, 16 as l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, 15 as l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, 4 as l. paracasei, 3 as l. gasseri, 2 as l. plantarum, and 1 as l. casei. in 4.5% of the  cases the results were discordant. of the 3 strains, not identified by species-specific pcr, 1 strain was identified by maldi-tof ms as l. spec. and 1 as l. parabuchneri. one strain could not be identified by either method. conclusions: both methods are highly sensitive. limitations can be the precision  of the primers (pcr) or the scarcity of strains from a certain habitat in the data base. additional information is necessary for the strains without or with discordant identification.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == the adherence of trichomonas vaginalis to host ectocervical cells is influenced by lactobacilli.
AB  == objectives: trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease, and adhesion of the pathogen trichomonas vaginalis to the host vaginal cells is the first step in establishing infection. for this to happen, the pathogen has to overcome a natural protective barrier composed mostly of lactobacilli. the objective of this study was to understand the role of lactobacilli in the adhesion of t vaginalis to host cells. methods: adhesion assays were carried out by incubating vaginal epithelial cells (vecs) with t vaginalis and lactobacilli together and compared with non-lactobacilli recipient controls. by varying incubation parameters and testing several microbial isolates, the number of pathogens that adhered to the vecs was determined by flow cytometry. results: overall, but with few exceptions, lactobacilli caused inhibition of t vaginalis adhesion to a variable degree. lactobacillus gasseri atcc 9857 and cbi3 (ambiguous lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus pentosus) caused the highest level of parasite adhesion inhibition  and enhancement, respectively. these isolates of lactobacillus can profoundly alter the adhesive properties of low-adherent and high-adherent strains of t vaginalis in a dose-dependent manner. additionally, the effects of lactobacilli on t vaginalis adhesion are strictly contact-dependent, and surface lipoglycans of t vaginalis are most likely not involved in this modulation of adhesion mediated by the bacteria. conclusions: lactobacilli can modulate adhesion of t vaginalis by significantly modifying the natural adhesive properties of various t vaginalis strains. this study highlights the importance of considering the role of the vaginal microbiota in the pathogenesis of trichomoniasis.

TI  == differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.

TI  == the application of genetics methods to differentiation of three lactobacillus species of human origin.
AB  == in recent decades, the interest in probiotics as diet supplements or drugs has increased. in order to determine a specific bacterial isolate to be probiotic, it is necessary to describe precisely its probiotic characteristics and taxonomic properties, including the strain level. most of the well-known genotyping methods were designed for the commonly-found pathogenic bacteria. the objective of this study is to undertake an attempt at standardization of fish, rapd and pfge methods to genotype and identify the bacteria belonging to lactobacillus fermentum, l. gasseri and l. plantarum species. the fish probes have been designed and tested for lactobacillus fermentum, l. gasseri and l. plantarum species and an endeavor has been made at standardization of rapd and pfge methods for these bacterial species. moreover, the mlst method was applied to differentiate lactobacillus plantarum strains. l. plantarum isolated from humans  could not be genetically diversified with the use of rapd, pfge or mlst methods;  only the strains originating from plants have displayed diversification among themselves and have been different from the strains of human origin.

TI  == oral microbial profile discriminates breast-fed from formula-fed infants.
AB  == objectives: little is known about the effect of diet on the oral microbiota of infants, although diet is known to affect the gut microbiota. the aims of the present study were to compare the oral microbiota in breast-fed and formula-fed infants, and investigate growth inhibition of streptococci by infant-isolated lactobacilli. methods: a total of 207 mothers consented to participation of their 3-month-old infants. a total of 146 (70.5%) infants were exclusively and 38 (18.4%) partially breast-fed, and 23 (11.1%) were exclusively formula-fed. saliva from all of their infants was cultured for lactobacillus species, with isolate identifications from 21 infants. lactobacillus isolates were tested for their ability to suppress streptococcus mutans and s sanguinis. oral swabs from 73 infants were analysed by the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for lactobacillus gasseri. results: lactobacilli were cultured from 27.8% of exclusively and partially breast-fed infants, but not from formula-fed infants. the prevalence of 14 homim-detected taxa, and total salivary lactobacilli counts differed by feeding method. multivariate modelling of homim-detected bacteria and possible confounders clustered samples from breast-fed infants separately from formula-fed infants. the microbiota of breast-fed infants differed based on vaginal or c-section delivery. isolates of l plantarum, l gasseri, and l vaginalis inhibited growth of the cariogenic s mutans and the commensal s sanguinis: l plantarum >l gasseri >l  vaginalis. conclusions: the microbiota of the mouth differs between 3-month-old breast-fed and formula-fed infants. possible mechanisms for microbial differences observed include species suppression by lactobacilli indigenous to breast milk.

TI  == studies on the effects of probiotic lactobacillus mixture given orally on vaginal and rectal colonization and on parameters of vaginal health in women with intermediate vaginal flora.
AB  == objectives: the vaginal microflora is composed of many bacterial species and plays a major role in maintaining the balance of this complex environment. this study was conducted in order to assess the degree and persistence of the colonization of vaginal epithelium by strains from an orally administered mixture of lactobacilli, containing lactobacillus fermentum 57a, lactobacillus plantarum  57b and lactobacillus gasseri 57c. we also monitored its effects on parameters of vaginal health, especially total lactobacilli counts, vaginal ph and nugent score. study design: the patient group in this open study consisted of clinically healthy women with intermediate vaginal flora. altogether 37 women were included  in the study; 25 finished the full cycle consisting of 8 visits during 70 days. lactobacillus mixture was administered as 1x10(8) c.f.u. once a day for 60 days.  lactobacillus isolates collected from vaginal and rectal samples from studied women during all visits were typed using molecular methods (pfge for l. fermentum and l. gasseri and mlst for l. plantarum). total lactobacilli counts, vaginal ph  and nugent score were also determined during the visits. results: we confirmed that the ingested strains were able to reach and colonize both sites within the third and eighth visits, i.e. between the 20th and 70th days of the study. maximal colonization was recorded between the fifth and seventh visits (31st-60th days). moreover, ingestion of the lactobacillus mixture was related to normalization of vaginal parameters (within 28-60 days after the initiation of the treatment). this was demonstrated by a decrease of vaginal ph and nugent score together with an increase of total numbers of lactobacilli in the vagina and rectum. no adverse events were noted during the course of the study. conclusions: oral application of the combination of the three probiotic strains derived from vaginal microbiota of healthy woman with high adherence abilities to both vaginal and colonic epithelium in vitro shows that both individual strains and their mixture can colonize vagina for some weeks, the effect of which is correlated with significant improvement of such parameters like ph and nugent score values and total numbers of vaginal lactobacilli. this indicates that the mixture may be a good candidate for the planned double-blind, placebo-controlled  randomized studies involving larger numbers of women.

TI  == comparative meta-analysis of the effect of lactobacillus species on weight gain in humans and animals.
AB  == background: obesity is associated with alteration of the gut microbiota. in order to clarify the effect of lactobacillus-containing probiotics (lcp) on weight we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies and experimental models. we intended to assess effects by lactobacillus species. methods: a broad search with no date or language restriction was performed. we included randomized controlled  trials (rcts) and comparative clinical studies in humans and animals or experimental models assessing the effect of lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight. we primarily attempted to extract and use change from baseline values. data were extracted independently by two authors. results were pooled by host and by lactobacillus species and are summarized in a meta-analysis of standardized difference in means (smds). results: we identified and included 17 rcts in humans, 51 studies on farm animals and 14 experimental models. lactobacillus acidophilus administration resulted in significant weight gain in humans and in animals (smd 0.15; 95% confidence intervals 0.05-0.25). results were consistent in humans and animals. lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus ingluviei were associated with weight gain in animals. lactobacillus plantarum was associated with weight loss in animals and lactobacillus gasseri was associated with weight  loss both in obese humans and in animals. conclusions: different lactobacillus species are associated different effects on weight change that are host-specific. further studies are needed to clarify the role of lactobacillus species in the human energy harvest and weight regulation. attention should be drawn to the potential effects of commonly marketed lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight gain.

TI  == inhibitory potential of lactobacilli against escherichia coli internalization by  ht 29 cells.
AB  == a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization method was employed to evaluate  the competitive inhibitory effect of three lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus plantarum) against escherichia  coli internalization in a model system of ht 29 cells. furthermore, aggregation and adhesion abilities of the lactobacillus strains were examined. all lactobacilli were able to attach to the ht 29 cells and aggregate with pathogens; however, the adhesion and aggregation degree was strain-dependent. l. reuteri possessed a high capacity of adhesion (6.80 +/- 0.63; log cfu +/- sem per well),  whereas lower capacities were expressed by l. gasseri (4.52 +/- 0.55) and l. plantarum (4.90 +/- 0.98). additionally, l. reuteri showed the rapid or normal ability to aggregate with selected e. coli in comparison with remaining two lactobacilli, which showed only slow or negative aggregative reaction. internalization of e. coli into the cell lines was markedly suppressed by l. reuteri, while l. gasseri and l. plantarum caused only a minimum anti-invasion effect. the fact that l. reuteri in our experiments showed an outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with the rest  strains, suggested that one of the possible mechanisms of preventing pathogen adhesion and invasion is simple competitions at certain receptors and capability  to block receptor binding sites, or that an avid interaction between l. reuteri and the host cell might be modulating intracellular events responsible for the e. coli internalization. moreover, l. reuteri exhibited a strong ability to aggregate with e. coli, which could be another limiting factor of pathogen invasion.

TI  == blueberry husks and probiotics attenuate colorectal inflammation and oncogenesis, and liver injuries in rats exposed to cycling dss-treatment.
AB  == long-term colonic inflammation promotes carcinogenesis and histological abnormalities of the liver, and colorectal tumours frequently arise in a background of dysplasia, a precursor of adenomas. altered colonic microbiota with an increased proportion of bacteria with pro-inflammatory characteristics, have been implicated in neoplastic progression. the composition of the microbiota can  be modified by dietary components such as probiotics, polyphenols and dietary fibres. in the present study, the influence of probiotics in combination with blueberry husks on colorectal carcinogenesis and subsequent liver damage was evaluated.colorectal tumours were induced in rats by cyclic treatment with dextran sulphate sodium (dss). blueberry husks and a mixture of three probiotic strains (bifidobacterium infantis dsm 15159, lactobacillus gasseri, dsm 16737 and lactobacillus plantarum dsm 15313) supplemented a basic diet fortified with oats. the condition of the rats was monitored using a disease activity index (dai). a qualitative and quantitative histological judgement was performed on segments of  distal colon and rectum and the caudate lobe of the liver. the formation of short-chain fatty acids, bacterial translocation, the inflammatory reaction and viable count of lactobacilli and enterobaceriaceae were addressed.blueberry husks with or without probiotics significantly decreased dai, and significantly reduced the number of colonic ulcers and dysplastic lesions. with a decreased proportion  of blueberry husk in the diet, the probiotic supplement was needed to achieve a significant decrease in numbers of dysplastic lesions. probiotics decreased faecal viable count of enterobacteriaceae and increased that of lactobacilli. blueberry husks with or without probiotics lowered the proportion of butyric acid in distal colon, and decreased the haptoglobin levels. probiotics mitigated hepatic injuries by decreasing parenchymal infiltration and the incidence of stasis and translocation. the results demonstrate a dietary option for use of blueberry husks and probiotics to delay colonic carcinogenesis and hepatic injuries in the rat model.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == acid production and growth by oral lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  == aim: to analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral lactobacillus species. methods: thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of lactobacillus, representing nine species, including lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de man, rogosa,  and sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (ph 7.0). acid production and growth were  measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. results: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species.  they also produced more acid than the others. lactobacillus vaginalis showed the  lowest rate of growth and acid production. these findings demonstrated that the different species of lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. conclusion: there was variation in acid production and growth between the lactobacillus species. the strongest acid producers were lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. it seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.

TI  == antagonistic activities of lactobacilli against helicobacter pylori growth and infection in human gastric epithelial cells.
AB  == lactobacilli have positive effects on bowel microflora and health in humans and animals. in this study, the antagonistic activities of lactobacillus gasseri chen, and l. plantarum 18 were assessed by agar plate diffusion assay and tests that determined the growth and urease activity of helicobacter pylori cocultured  with lactobacilli and the adherence of h. pylori to human gastric epithelial cells in the presence of lactobacilli. the results showed that the 2 lactobacillus strains had significant anti-h.pylori activity, and this activity may be contributed by the cell-free supernatants (cfs) of lactobacilli and live lactobacillus strains in vitro. the antagonistic activity of the cfs against h. pylori depended on the ph and the presence of metabolites, such as organic acids  and proteases. our results also indicated that 2 lactobacillus strains could inhibit h. pylori adherence human gastric epithelial cells. practical application: helicobacter pylori causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease,  and gastric cancer, and it infects about 50% of the world's population. lactobacilli have been reported to have an inhibitory effect on h. pylori and can be used as probiotic to manufacture dairy products preventing h. pylori infection.

TI  == in vitro testing of commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of selected commercial and potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria using common in vitro screening assays such as transit tolerance in the upper human gastrointestinal tract, adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines and effect on epithelial barrier function. the selected bacteria include strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus farciminis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus reuteri and pediococcus pentosaceus. viable counts after simulated  gastric transit tolerance showed that l. reuteri strains and p. pentosaceus tolerate gastric juice well, with no reduction of viability, whereas l. pentosus, l. farciminis and l. sakei strains lost viability over 180min. all strains tested tolerate the simulated small intestinal juice well. the bacterial adhesion capacity to human intestinal cells revealed major species and strain differences. overall, l. plantarum mf1298 and three l. reuteri strains had a significant higher adhesion capacity compared to the other strains tested. all strains, both  living and uv-inactivated, had little effect on the epithelial barrier function.  however, living l. reuteri strains revealed a tendency to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) from 6 to 24h. this work demonstrates the diversity of 18 potential probiotic bacteria, with major species and strain specific effects in the in vitro screening assays applied. overall, l. reuteri strains reveal some interesting characteristics compared to the other strains investigated.

TI  == oral and faecal lactobacilli and their expression of mannose-specific adhesins in individuals with and without iga deficiency.
AB  == lactobacilli are present in the intestine and oral cavity of most adults. secretory iga in mucosal secretions may provide carbohydrate receptors for bacterial adhesins. here, oral and faecal samples from 33 iga-deficient individuals and 34 controls were cultured for lactobacilli, which were identified using species-specific pcr or partial 16s rdna sequencing and tested for expression of mannose-specific adhesins. lactobacilli were found in the oral cavity of 76% of iga-deficient and 85% of control individuals. lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus gasseri dominated in both groups. lactobacillus fermentum was less common in iga-deficient individuals than in controls (p=0.0055) and lactobacillus salivarius was less common in symptomatic than in healthy iga-deficient individuals (p=0.0051). faecal samples yielded lactobacilli in most individuals. l. paracasei was most frequent, followed by l. gasseri and lactobacillus plantarum. mannose-specific adhesins were expressed more frequently by oral than by faecal isolates (p=0.032) and oral isolates adhered in higher numbers than faecal isolates (46 vs. 14 bacteria/cell, p=0.0038). faecal isolates from iga-deficient individuals more frequently expressed mannose-specific adhesins than faecal isolates from controls (p=0.039). mannose-specific adhesins  may be a colonisation factor in the oral cavity, and the presence of secretory iga may modify adhesin expression. however, secretory iga seems to have little influence on lactobacillus species distribution.

TI  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria induce differential interferon-beta profiles in dendritic cells.
AB  == the health promoting effects of probiotics are well-documented; however, current  knowledge on immunostimulatory effects is based on data from a single strain or a limited selection of strains or species. here, we compared the capacity of 27 lactobacilli and 16 bifidobacteria strains to stimulate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (dc). most lactobacilli strains, including lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum, induced strong il-12 and tnf-alpha production and up-regulation of maturation markers. in contrast, all bifidobacteria and certain lactobacilli strains were low il-12 and tnf-alpha inducers. il-10 and il-6 levels showed less  variation and no correlation with il-12 and tnf-alpha. dc matured by strong il-12-inducing strains also produced high levels of interferon (ifn)-beta. when combining two strains, low il-12 inducers inhibited this ifn-beta production as well as il-12 and th1-skewing chemokines. the ifn-beta induction was mediated through c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) irrespective of the stimulating strain. the inhibitory bacteria induced higher levels of the transcription factor c-jun dimerization protein (jdp)-2, thereby counteracting the effect of jnk. our data demonstrate that lactobacilli can be divided into two groups of bacteria featuring contrasting effects, while all bifidobacteria exhibit uniform effects.  this underlines the importance of selecting the proper strain(s) for probiotic purposes.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == immunomodulatory activity of lactobacillus strains isolated from fermented vegetables and infant stool.
AB  == four lactobacillus strains - lactobacillus plantarum cjlp133, l. plantarum cjlp243, l. plantarum cjnr26, and lactobacillus gasseri cjmf3 - were isolated from korean fermented food or healthy infant feces, and their capacity to modulate cellular and humoral immune responses was studied. feeding of the tested lactobacilli for 8 weeks did not alter the weight of and cell numbers in the spleen of mice. however, cjlp133 and cjlp243 strains increased the t lymphocyte population in the spleen of mice, while cjnr26 and cjmf3 increased the b lymphocyte population. in splenocytes treated with concanavalin a, ingestion of cjlp133 and cjlp243 promoted t lymphocyte proliferation and secretion of t cell cytokines, whereas feeding of the cjnr26 and cjmf3 strains enhanced b lymphocyte  proliferation in splenocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide and plaque formation. these results suggest that cjlp133 and cjlp243 have immunostimulating  activity through the enhancement of t cell activation, while cjnr26 and cjmf3 exhibit immunopotentiation through the increment of b cell activation.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic characteristics of newly isolated lactobacillus spp.: immune modulation and longevity.
AB  == in the current study, the probiotic potential of approximately 350 strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from korean infant feces and kimchi was investigated. common probiotic properties of the bacterial strains, such as acid  tolerance, bile tolerance and adhesion to human intestinal epithelial cells (ht-29 cells), were examined. some strains were found to have immune modulatory and antimicrobial properties. antagonistic activity against a panel of pathogenic bacteria was found to be strain dependent. to evaluate the immune modulatory activity of the strains, lymphocyte interferon (ifn)-gamma secretion was determined in conjunction with cell proliferation. some strains of lactobacillus  gasseri, l. fermentum and l. plantarum exhibited increased ifn-gamma levels and lymphocyte proliferation. to evaluate the effects of these immune modulating lactobacilli on host life span, caenorhabditis elegans was used as an in vivo model. nematodes that were supplied heat-killed lactobacilli as a food source exhibited obvious differences in life span compared with those fed escherichia coli op50. the mean life span (determined as mean percent survival) of worms fed  l. plantarum cjlp133 and l. fermentum la12 was 13.89% and 13.69% greater, respectively, than that of control nematodes after 21 days (p=0.036 and 0.043, respectively). in addition, some of safety profiles, including hemolytic type, gelatin hydration and degradation of urea, were found to be positive. these newly identified lactobacilli hold promise for use as probiotic agents, feed additives  and/or in food applications.

TI  == intestinal lactoflora in estonian and norwegian patients with antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == the disruption of intestinal microbiota is an important risk factor for the development of clostridium difficile caused antibiotic associated diarrhea (aad). the role of intestinal lactoflora in protection against c. difficile is unclear.  fecal samples (n = 74) from aad patients were investigated for c. difficile and lactobacilli by culture and real-time pcr. lactobacilli were identified by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr (eric-pcr) and sequencing of  16s rrna. in c. difficile negative cases we found somewhat higher counts of intestinal lactobacilli (5.02 vs. 2.15 cfu log(10)/g; p = 0.053) by culture and more frequently lactobacillus plantarum (33.3% vs. 9.4%; p = 0.03) as compared with positive ones. results of total counts of lactobacilli comparing estonian and norwegian samples were conflicting by culture and pcr. we found higher colonization of norwegian aad patients with l. plantarum (21% vs. 5%, p = 0.053)  and estonians with lactobacillus gasseri (19% vs. 2%, p = 0.023). particular lactobacilli (e.g. l. plantarum) may have a role in protection against c. difficile, whereas the meaning of total counts of lactobacilli remains questionable. in different persons and nations, different lactobacilli species may have a protective role against c. difficile.

TI  == group-specific comparison of four lactobacilli isolated from human sources using  differential blast analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been used in fermentation processes for centuries. more recent applications including the use of lab as probiotics have significantly increased industrial interest. here we present a comparative genomic analysis of four completely sequenced lactobacillus strains, isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract, versus 25 lactic acid bacterial genomes present in the public database at the time of analysis. lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc533, lactobacillus gasseri atcc33323, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1are all considered probiotic and widely used in industrial applications. using differential blast analysis (dba), each genome was compared to the respective remaining three other lactobacillus and 25 other lab genomes. dba highlighted strain-specific genes that were not represented in any other lab used in this analysis and also identified group-specific genes shared within lactobacilli. initial comparative analyses highlighted a significant number of genes involved in cell adhesion, stress responses, dna repair and modification, and metabolic capabilities. furthermore, the range of the recently  identified potential autonomous units (paus) was broadened significantly, indicating the possibility of distinct families within this genetic element. based on in silico results obtained for the model organism l. acidophilus ncfm, dba proved to be a valuable tool to identify new key genetic regions for functional genomics and also suggested re-classification of previously annotated  genes.

TI  == an in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  == a method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. the novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic lactobacillus strains. only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. the application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic lactobacillus strains  belonging to lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus vaginalis species. even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up  makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli with antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori from traditionally fermented foods.
AB  == helicobacter pylori may cause stomach diseases such as chronic gastritis, peptic  ulcer, and gastric cancer, and several studies reported that lactobacilli have inhibitory effects on h. pylori. in this study, 38 lactobacillus strains were screened for anti-h. pylori activity using in vitro methods, including survivability under the simulated gastric conditions, agar plate diffusion, urease activity, coaggregation, autoaggregation, and hydrocarbon analysis. the results indicate that 2 lactobacillus strains showed potential anti-h. pylori activity in vitro. lactobacillus plantarum 18 had the largest zone of inhibition  and markedly reduced the urease activity of h. pylori. lactobacillus gasseri chen had higher coaggregation rate (58.15%) and hydrophobicity (59.27%) compared with  the other strains. further research is needed to verify the activities of these strains against h. pylori.

TI  == comparative evaluation of automated ribotyping and rapd-pcr for typing of lactobacillus spp. occurring in dental caries.
AB  == a group of 67 lactobacillus spp. strains containing lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius species isolated  from early childhood caries and identified to the species level in a previous study (svec et al., folia microbiol 54:53-58, 2009) was characterized by automated ribotyping performed by the riboprinter microbial characterization system and by randomly amplified polymorphic dna fingerprinting (rapd-pcr) with m13 primer to evaluate these techniques for characterization of lactobacilli associated with dental caries. ribotyping revealed 55 riboprints among the analysed group. the automatic identification process performed by the riboprinter system identified 18 strains to the species level, however cluster analysis divided obtained ribotype patterns into individual clusters mostly corresponding  to the species assignment of particular strains. rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed by the individual lactobacillus spp. showed higher variability than the ribotype  patterns and the fingerprint profiles generated by the analysed species were distributed among one to four clusters. in conclusion, ribotyping is shown to be  more convenient for the identification purposes while rapd-pcr fingerprinting results indicate this method is a better tool for typing of lactobacillus spp. strains occurring in dental caries.

TI  == lactobacillus spp. associated with early childhood caries.
AB  == a group of 69 lactobacilli was isolated from caries lesions and root canals of early childhood caries (ecc) affected children treated in the department of pedodontics (children's teaching hospital, brno, czech republic). biochemical and physiological properties of all strains were characterized by api 50 ch kit and conventional tube tests. the rep-pcr fingerprinting with the (gtg)(5) primer was  used for genotypic grouping of the isolates. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting grouped all analyzed strains into a few clusters in nearly full agreement with phenotype identification results and clarified the taxonomic position of 13 biochemically unidentified strains. in total, 20 strains of lactobacillus fermentum, 17 l. rhamnosus, 14 l. casei/paracasei, 7 l. gasseri, 7 l. salivarius  and 4 l. plantarum were identified. mixtures of two or even three lactobacillus spp. were isolated from a few root canal content samples. results obtained by biotyping and (gtg)(5)-pcr were generally comparable except for l. gasseri strains that were not biochemically identified. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting was shown to be quicker, easier to perform and more reliable than biotyping. our  results imply this molecular method as a good tool for screening and identification of lactobacillus spp. inhabiting dental plaque.

TI  == bacteriophages of lactobacillus.
AB  == in this review, we are listing lactobacillus phages that have been reported in peer-reviewed articles published since 1960. putative phages that are defective or have not been shown to be infectious, such as phage-like particles, are not discussed. our literature searches led to the identification of 231 lactobacillus phages, 186 of which have been observed by electron microscopy, with 109 belonging to the siphoviridae family, 76 to the myoviridae family, and 1 to the podoviridae family. model phages infecting lb delbrueckii, casei, rhamnosus, plantarum, and gasseri are highlighted, as well as prophages of lactobacillus hosts. to date, nine complete lactobacillus phage genomes are available for comparisons and evolution studies. features such as phage receptors and endolysins are also reviewed, as well as phage-derived genetic tools. lactobacillus phage research has progressed significantly over the past decade but a thorough understanding of their biology is still lacking. because of the risks they represent and the knowledge gaps that need to be filled, the outlook for research on lactobacillus phages is bright.

TI  == characterization of indigenous vaginal lactobacilli from healthy women as probiotic candidates.
AB  == the probiotic relevant characteristics of 45 strains of vaginal lactobacillus isolated from healthy women were analyzed. of these, 21 strains were classified as l. crispatus, 17 as l. jensenii, six as l. gasseri, and one as l. plantarum. the rate of acidification varied significantly between the strains as did their ability to form biofilms. none used glycogen as a fermentable carbohydrate. h2o2  generation was common, especially among l. jensenii isolates (88%). no bacteriocinogenic strains were detected. most strains harbored plasmids (from 1 to 7) of various sizes, those in excess of 50 kb being frequent. one of these plasmids was found to be promiscuous since it hybridized with extrachromosomal bands of 15 isolates. all strains were resistant to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, clindamycin, trimethoprim, and sulfametoxazole and susceptible to a series of beta-lactams, erythromycin, tetracycline, and benzalkonium chloride. almost half of the strains were highly resistant to nonoxinol 9, which is commonly used as a spermicide. based on these analyses, strains of all three common species are proposed as new probiotic candidates.

TI  == intra-individual diversity and similarity of salivary and faecal microbiota.
AB  == in the present study, polyphasic analysis [cultivation, combined with the fingerprinting of individual isolates, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge)] was applied to study whether similar features concerning  the diversity and temporal stability of selected bacterial groups could be detected intra-individually in two different niches - the oral cavity and the colon - from ten adult volunteers consuming probiotics. the predominant bacterial microbiota, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group and bifidobacterial populations, were generally stable in salivary and faecal samples, with the greater diversity seen in faeces. furthermore, different species predominated at  the two different sites. lactobacillus group dgge profiles were unstable, yet the intra-individual profiles from faecal and salivary samples collected at the same  time resembled each other. the ingested probiotic product did not affect the stability of the bacterial groups studied. the culture-based analysis showed that most subjects harboured identical indigenous lactobacillus genotypes in saliva and faeces (lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum group). thus, identical indigenous lactobacilli were able to inhabit both ends of the orogastrointestinal tract, whereas the composition of the other bacterial groups studied varied between the  two sites.

TI  == blueberry husks and multi-strain probiotics affect colonic fermentation in rats.
AB  == the aim was to investigate how blueberry husks and/or mixtures of probiotic strains (lactobacillus crispatus dsm16743, l. gasseri dsm16737 and l. plantarum dsm15313 (labmix), or bifidobacterium infantis dsm15159 and dsm15161 (bifmix)) affect colonic fermentation, caecal counts of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterobacteriaceae, body weight gain, and blood concentrations of carboxylic acids (ca) and ammonia in rats. dietary fibres in blueberry husks were fermented  to 61 % in colon, and the elevated faecal excretion of fibre and protein contributed to the high faecal bulking capacity (1.3). the caecal pool of ca was  higher in rats fed blueberry husks than the fibre-free control (p < 0.05), and the propionic acid proportion was higher in the distal colon than in the control  group (p < 0.05). probiotics lowered the caecal amount of ca when added to blueberry husks (p < 0.001), while the propionic acid proportion was higher with  labmix (p < 0.01) than blueberry husks only. the propionic acid and butyric acid  concentrations in blood were higher in rats fed blueberry husks and probiotics than those fed blueberry husks only (p < 0.01), implying that the absorption of these acids was facilitated by the bacteria. the caecal counts of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterobacteriaceae were lower in rats fed blueberry husks than the control diet (p < 0.05). the body weight gain was partly influenced by the caecal tissue and contents weights, and bifmix decreased the ammonia concentration in blood (p < 0.05). we conclude that colonic fermentation is differentially affected by dietary fibre and probiotics, which may be of importance when developing foods with certain health effects.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == an anti-hiv microbicide engineered in commensal bacteria: secretion of hiv-1 fusion inhibitors by lactobacilli.
AB  == objectives: to engineer lactobacillus spp. to secrete hiv-1 fusion inhibitors with potent neutralizing activity against primary hiv-1 isolates. methods: hiv-1  fusion inhibitors (fi-1, fi-2, and fi-3) were introduced into the previously developed shuttle vector ptsv2 and transformed in l. plantarum and l. gasseri. the signal peptide usp45 from l. lactis was used to achieve high secretion efficiency of peptides into the bacterial supernatant. the antiviral activity of  lactobacillus-derived hiv-1 fusion inhibitors was tested against a panel of primary hiv-1 isolates and a chimeric simian/hiv (shiv-162p3) using the tzm infection assay. tzm-bl cells are engineered hela cells that express cd4, ccr5, and cxcr4 and contain integrated reporter genes for firefly luciferase and beta-galactosidase under the control of an hiv-1 long terminal repeat. the amount of secreted fusion inhibitor fi-3 was determined by western blot analysis and the antiviral specificity verified by antibody-mediated depletion of peptide fi-3 and hiv-1 infection with vsv-g envelope pseudotyped virions. results: viral infectivity of primary hiv-1 isolates and shiv-162p3 was neutralized by up to 98% and 72%, respectively, by 10% (v/v) lactobacillus supernatant containing fusion inhibitor fi-3. the antiviral activity of the lactobacillus-derived fusion inhibitor fi-3 was clearly shown to be attributable to the secreted fusion inhibitor peptide. conclusion: the development of recombinant lactobacilli expressing hiv-1 fusion inhibitors with potent neutralizing activity represents an important step toward the development of a live microbial (topical) microbicide against hiv-1 transmission.

TI  == molecular identification of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from bulgarian women.
AB  == lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining the vaginal health of women. the development of suitable bacterial replacement therapies for the treatment of  vaginosis requires knowledge of the vaginal lactobacilli species representation.  the aim of this study was to identify at the species level vaginal lactobacillus  isolates obtained from bulgarian women in childbearing age by using different molecular methods. twenty-two strains of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples were identified and grouped according to their genetic relatedness. a combined approach, which included amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), ribotyping and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific oligonucleotide primers was applied. all vaginal isolates were grouped into 5 clusters in comparison with a set of 21 reference strains based on the initial ardra results, which was then confirmed by ribotyping. finally, the strains were  subjected to pcr analysis with eight different species-specific primer pairs, which allowed most of them to be classified as belonging to one of the following  species: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, this study suggests that the most straightforward identification strategy for vaginal lactobacilli would be grouping by ardra or ribotyping, followed by pcr specific primers identification at species level.

TI  == an analysis of the effectiveness of heat-killed lactic acid bacteria in alleviating allergic diseases.
AB  == allergic diseases are reported to be caused by a skew in the balance between t helper type 1 and 2 cells. because some lactic acid bacteria have been shown to stimulate il-12 (p70) production, which in turn shifts the balance between the t  helper type 1 and 2 cell response from the latter to the former, they have the potential to either prevent or ameliorate disease conditions or both. they have therefore been extensively studied in the recent past for their probiotic activities. nevertheless, much less information is available concerning the microbial factors that determine the strain-dependent ability to affect the production of cytokines. the objectives of our study were first to select potentially probiotic lactobacilli that strongly stimulate cytokine production in vitro, and then to determine whether the selected lactobacillus strains could suppress antigen-specific ige production in vivo by using allergic model animals. finally, our investigation was extended to analyze which bacterial components were responsible for the observed biological activity. twenty strains of heat-killed lactobacilli isolated from humans were screened for their stimulatory activity for the production of il-12 (p70) by murine splenocytes in vitro. the results showed that some strains of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus gasseri had a higher stimulatory activity for il-12 (p70) production than the other lactobacilli tested; however, this effect was strain dependent rather than  species dependent. oral administration of the heat-killed strains that showed higher stimulatory activity for il-12 (p70) production tended to reduce the serum antigen-specific ige levels in ovalbumin-sensitized balb/c mice compared with the controls. among the lactobacilli tested, l. gasseri oll2809 showed the highest activity in reducing the level of antigen-specific ige. furthermore, the stimulatory activity for il-12 (p70) production was found to be reduced after treating the lactobacilli with n-acetyl-muramidase and to be positively correlated with the amount of peptidoglycan in the cells. the present data suggest that l. gasseri oll2809 is a good candidate for potential probiotics in terms of either the prevention or amelioration of allergic diseases or both. in addition, the strain-dependent stimulatory activity for il-12 (p70) production was found to be due, at least in part, to the amount of peptidoglycan present in  the cells.

TI  == trans fatty acids promote the growth of some lactobacillus strains.
AB  == five lactobacillus strains (2 l. gasseri, 2 l. plantarum and 1 l. reuteri) were cultured in modified mrs medium containing fatty acids (fas) instead of tween 80  for 24 h at 37 degrees c, to learn the effect of saturated and unsaturated fas on the lactobacillus growth. free fas included palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (c9-16:1), stearic (18:0), oleic (c9-18:1), elaidic (t9-18:1), cis-vaccenic (c11-18:1), vaccenic (t11-18:1), linoleic (c9, c12-18:2), conjugated linoleic (c9, t11- and t10, c12-18:2), alpha-linolenic (c9, c12, c15-18:3), alpha-eleostearic (c9, t11, t13-18:3), eicosapentaenoic (20:5), and docosahexaenoic (22:6) acids. among free fas, oleic acid stimulated the growth of all lactobacillus strains, whereas palmitoleic acid had almost no affect on the lactobacillus growth. saturated fas such as stearic and palmitic acids inhibited  or did not affect the lactobacillus growth. polyunsaturated fas such as alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids strongly inhibited the lactobacillus growth at 7.6 x 10(-4) m. octadecenoic acids such as oleic, elaidic, cis-vaccenic and vaccenic acids remarkably promoted the growth of l. gasseri, regardless of the different double bond positions and configurations. when oleic or cis-vaccenic acid was incubated with l. gasseri, the fas was transformed to cyclopropane fas (methyleneoctadecanoic acids) after incorporation into the cells. on the other hand, trans fas such as elaidic and vaccenic acids incorporated into the cells were not converted to another fas. conjugated linoleic and alpha-eleostearic acids having a trans double bond promoted the lactobacillus growth. the growth of l. gasseri was also stimulated by trans-rich  free fas from hydrogenated canola and fish oils. these results showed that octadecenoic acid and trans fas had strong promotion activities for the lactobacillus growth due to their incorporation into membrane lipids.

TI  == lactobacillus vaginal microbiota of women attending a reproductive health care service in benin city, nigeria.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to determine whether lactobacillus species found in african women differ substantially to those of white decent, described in previous studies. the vaginal microbiota play an important role in female health, and when the naturally dominant lactobacilli are displaced resulting in bacterial vaginosis (bv), the host is more at risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases, including hiv. methods: vaginal samples were collected from 241 healthy, premenopausal nigerian women, which were then gram-stained for nugent scoring. microbial dna was extracted, amplified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and lactobacillus primers, and processed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). lactobacillus species were identified by dna sequencing and blast algorithm. results: of the samples, 207 (85.8%) had pcr products for lactobacilli, whereas 34 (14.2%) showed absence of lactobacilli, which correlated to the bv nugent scores. on sequencing of amplicons, 149 subjects (72%) had sequence homologies to lactobacilli. most women (64%) were colonized by l. iners as the predominant strain, similar to previous findings in canadian and swedish women. l. gasseri was found in 7.3% samples, followed by l. plantarum, l. suntoryeus, l. crispatus, l. rhamnosus, and other species. conclusion: the findings indicate that even with geographic, racial, and other differences, the predominant vaginal lactobacillus species is similar to species in women from northern countries.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == [antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

TI  == [inhibitory activity of vaginal lactobacillus bacteria on yeasts causing vulvovaginal candidiasis].
AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

TI  == susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. fifty-eight lactobacillus isolates were identified as l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii spp. lactis, l. crispatus, l. plantarum, l. cellobiosus, l. jensenii, l. salivarius, l. curvatus, l. brevis and l. oris. the inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 lactobacillus spp. and candida albicans (ajd 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on c. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on lactobacillus isolates. the natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination  for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.

TI  == lactobacilli in the intestinal microbiota of swedish infants.
AB  == lactobacillus colonisation was examined in 112 swedish infants. faecal samples obtained at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks and at 6, 12 and 18 months of age were cultivated quantitatively on rogosa agar. lactobacilli were speciated by pcr and typed to the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd). lactobacilli reached a peak at 6 months when 45% of the infants were colonised. l. rhamnosus and l. gasseri were the most common species in this period. colonisation by lactobacilli in general (p < 0.01) and l. rhamnosus in particular (p < 0.05) was  more common in breast-fed than in weaned infants at 6 months of age. lactobacillus isolation reached a nadir of 17% by 12 months (p < 0.0001), but increased to 31% by 18 months of age p < 0.05). the food-related species l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii dominated in this second phase. a single strain persisted for at least 3 weeks in 17% of the infants during the first 6 months, most commonly l. rhamnosus. lactobacillus population counts in colonised infants increased from 10(6.4) cfu/g at 1 week to  10(8.8) cfu/g at 6 months, and then dropped to 10(5.4) cfu/g faeces at 12 months  of age. lactobacillus colonisation was not significantly related to delivery mode, or to presence of siblings or pets in the household. our results suggest that certain lactobacillus species, especially l. rhamnosus, thrive in the intestinal flora of breast-fed infants. after weaning they are replaced by other  lactobacillus species of types found in food.

TI  == rapid identification of probiotic lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s  rrna.
AB  == this study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic lactobacillus species such as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna  genes and their rrna intergenic spacer region of each species. it was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the  general biochemical methods. the phylogenetic analyses, using 16s rdna sequences  of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex pcr assay were trustworthy. taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven lactobacillus species.

AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == presence of drug resistance in intestinal lactobacilli of dairy and human origin  in turkey.
AB  == the prevalence of different resistance genes was investigated in lactobacilli of  human and dairy origin by pcr. the presence of erm, van, tet, and cat-tc genes were determined in 16 raw milk, 15 cream, 10 yogurt, 50 hand-made cheese, and 20  industrially produced white-cheese samples of dairy origin and 16 mouth, 32 fecal, and 36 vaginal samples from different subjects of human origin. lactobacilli of dairy and human origin were found to carry only erm(b) and tet(m) genes. the majority of the isolates, lactobacillus crispatus (61), lactobacillus  gasseri (49), lactobacillus plantarum (80) studied were found to harbor either erm(b) or tet(m) gene or both. no resistant lactobacilli was found in raw-milk and cream samples. all the human fecal samples and the majority of vaginal (29 of 36) and mouth (10 of 14) samples were found to carry the resistance genes. while  a third of the hand-made cheeses carried resistant lactobacilli only one industrially produced cheese was found to carry resistant lactobacilli. furthermore, the genes were found in the non-starter species, lactobacillus acidophilus and lb. plantarum, indicating that industrially produced cheeses in this respect could be considered more favorable. these results indicate that drug resistance seems to be very common in turkey. even though the number of dairy samples harboring the resistance genes (17 of 111) is smaller in regards to human samples, 10% of them were still found to carry the resistance genes as well. the  presence of the resistance genes in majority of the samples of human origin and in minority of the samples of dairy origin indicates that drug resistance may be  acquired in the intestinal tract during passage and spread to dairy products by the hands of workers during production.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infection of human intestinal cells in vitro.
AB  == there are many examples of probiotic effects of various lactic bacteria on enteropathogens. in this study, lactobacillus strains (l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri,  l. casei and l. plantarum) were tested in an in vitro model of enterohemorrhagic  escherichia coli (ehec) infection of a human colon epithelial cell line, c2bbe1.  while the adhesion and colonization of ehec was not affected by any of the lactobacillus strains tested, the internalization of ehec into the cell line was  markedly suppressed by l. rhamnosus, though not by others. concerning the possible mechanisms, the viabilities of ehec and host cell were not affected by the presence of l. rhamnosus. simple competitions at certain receptors were unlikely because the suppressive effect on ehec internalization was strictly dependent on viable l. rhamnosus and could not be observed with the conditioned medium or killed l. rhamnosus. the fact that l. rhamnosus showed outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with other strains, suggested that an avid interaction between l. rhamnosus and the host cell might be modulating intra-cellular events responsible for the internalization of ehec.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

AB  == three prophage sequences were identified in the lactobacillus johnsoni strain ncc533. prophage lj965 predicted a gene map very similar to those of pac-site streptococcus thermophilus phages over its dna packaging and head and tail morphogenesis modules. sequence similarity linked the putative dna packaging and  head morphogenesis genes at the protein level. prophage lj965/s. thermophilus phage sfi11/lactococcus lactis phage tp901-1 on one hand and lactobacillus delbrueckii phage ll-h/lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e/listeria monocytogenes phage a118 on the other hand defined two sublines of structural gene clusters in pac-site siphoviridae from low-gc gram-positive bacteria. bacillus subtilis phage spp1 linked both sublines. the putative major head and tail proteins from lj965 shared weak sequence similarity with phages from gram-negative bacteria. a clearly independent line of structural genes in siphoviridae from low-gc gram-positive bacteria is defined by temperate cos-site  phages including lactobacillus gasseri phage adh, which also shared sequence similarity with phage d3 infecting a gram-negative bacterium. a phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the clpp-like protein identified in four cos-site siphoviridae from lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and pseudomonas showed graded sequence relationships. the tree suggested that the clpp-like proteins from the phages were not acquired by horizontal gene transfer from their corresponding bacterial hosts.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == identification of lactobacillus species of human origin by a commercial kit, api50chl.
AB  == the efficacy of a biochemical kit, api50chl kit, for identification of intestinal and vaginal lactobacilli from humans was evaluated by comparing with the results  of dna-dna hybridization assay. the results showed that in total only 52 of the 172 strains (30.2%) tested were identified correctly by the kit at species level. especially all strains of some species, such as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus, were misidentified as lactobacillus acidophilus by the kit. however, the kit was found to be reliable for identification of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. this suggests that the exact identification of lactobacillus isolates from human stool and vaginal specimens by api50chl kit is  difficult without the support of modern genotypic technique.

TI  == the expression signals of the lactobacillus brevis slpa gene direct efficient heterologous protein production in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a cassette based on the expression signals of the lactobacillus brevis surface (s)-layer protein gene (slpa) was constructed. the low-copy-number vector pkth2095, derived from pgk12, was used as the cloning vector. the efficiency of slpa promoters in intracellular protein production was studied using three reporter genes, beta-glucuronidase (gusa), luciferase (luc) and aminopeptidase n  (pepn) in three different lactic acid bacteria hosts: lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus gasseri. the s-layer promoters were recognized in each strain and especially l. lactis and lb. plantarum exhibited high levels of transcripts. the production kinetics of reporter proteins was studied as a function of growth. the gusa, luc and pepn activities varied considerably among the lactic acid bacterial strains studied. the highest levels  of beta-glucuronidase and luciferase activity were obtained in l. lactis. the level of gusa obtained in l. lactis corresponded to over 15% of the total cellular proteins. the highest level of aminopeptidase n activity was achieved in lb. plantarum where pepn corresponded up to 28% of the total cellular proteins at the late exponential phase of growth. this level of pepn activity is 30-fold higher than that in lb. helveticus, which is the species from which the pepn gene originates.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == characterization of the aggregation promoting factor from lactobacillus gasseri,  a vaginal isolate.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri 2459, isolated from the human vagina, exhibits a strong autoaggregating phenotype. filter-sterilized spent supernatants of this strain promote aggregation of lact. plantarum ll441 and enterococcus faecalis ef. aggregation was abolished upon exposure of the cells to proteases and, in the case of ent. faecalis, to metaperiodate, which suggests the involvement of cell-surface proteins and glycoproteins, respectively, in the aggregation phenotype. in accordance with this, a 75 kda surface protein, and possibly another of approximately 94 kda, appears in lact. plantarum ll441 cultures incubated with lact. gasseri culture supernatants. the diffusible aggregation promoting factor was purified from stationary phase culture supernatants and determined to be a 2 kda hydrophilic peptide active at ph 3-4 and stable at neutral and acid ph. the activity was resistant to heat, chymotrypsin, chelating  agents, triton x-100 and reducing agents, but sensitive to other proteases and sds.

TI  == high level heterologous protein production in lactococcus and lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the lactobacillus brevis s-layer signals.
AB  == a secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a s-layer  protein (slpa) from lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. e. coli beta-lactamase (bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the s-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in lactococcus lactis,  lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pgk12. in all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpa signals and all bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. the lb. brevis s-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in l. lactis, lb. brevis and lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. gasseri the slpa promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. the production of bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. the highest yield of bla was obtained with l. lactis and lb. brevis. without ph control, substantial degradation of bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (lab) tested. when growing l. lactis and lb. brevis under ph control, the bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. l. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of bla which to our knowledge  represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by lab so far. the short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) bla molecules/cell per h. such a high rate was also observed with lb. plantarum, whereas in lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpa gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of bla  production. the results obtained indicate wide applicability of the lb. brevis slpa signals for efficient protein production and secretion in lab.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  == two-hundred and fifty lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. data were processed by the jaccard (sj) and simple matching (ssm) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. seventeen major clusters were defined at the  76% sj-similarity level which approximately correspond to the ssm-level of 91%. seven clusters could be identified: lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), lact. buchneri (4% of patients), lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains. cluster 1 included the type strains of lact. crispatus, lact. acidophilus, lact. jensenii and lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lact. agilis and lact. casei subsp. tolerans. clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. no obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.
