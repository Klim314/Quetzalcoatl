TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == enhanced expression of fucosyl ga1 in the digestive tract of immune-deficient scid, nude and pigr(-/-) mice.
AB  == fucosylation of ga1 in murine intestinal epithelia occurs through transcriptional induction of alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase along with bacterial infection, but the  mechanism has not been clearly characterized as to whether it is induced as a result of an immune response to bacteria or of genetic manipulation of the host by bacteria. accordingly, we analysed the expression of fucosyl ga1 (fga1) and fucosyltransferase activity in the digestive tracts of immune-deficient scid, nude and pigr(-/-) mice. in comparison with those in control mice bred under the  same spf circumstances, the amount of fga1 and the alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase activity were significantly increased in the immune-deficient mice, indicating that the immune system is not involved in induction of the alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase gene. reflecting the enhanced synthesis of fga1, the  total amounts of fga1 in the intestinal contents of immune-deficient mice were higher than those in control mice. also, the major faecal bacteria grown on a mrs agar plate were different in immune-deficient and control mice as follows, lactobacillus murinus for scid and pigr(-/-) mice, and lactobacillus johnsonii for their control, and enterococcus faecalis for nude mice and lactococcus garvieae for the control, indicating that an alteration in the intestinal lactobacilli is partly involved in the induction of alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase.

TI  == indication for co-evolution of lactobacillus johnsonii with its hosts.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota, composed of complex bacterial populations, is host-specific and affected by environmental factors as well as host genetics.  one important bacterial group is the lactic acid bacteria (lab), which include many health-promoting strains. here, we studied the genetic variation within a potentially probiotic lab species, lactobacillus johnsonii, isolated from various hosts. results: a wide survey of 104 fecal samples was carried out for the isolation of l. johnsonii. as part of the isolation procedure, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (trflp) was performed to identify l. johnsonii within a selected narrow spectrum of fecal lab. the trflp results showed host specificity of two bacterial species, the enterococcus faecium species cluster and lactobacillus intestinalis, to different host taxonomic groups while the appearance of l. johnsonii and e. faecalis was not correlated with any taxonomic group. the survey ultimately resulted in the isolation of l. johnsonii from few host species. the genetic variation among the 47 l. johnsonii  strains isolated from the various hosts was analyzed based on variation at simple sequence repeats (ssr) loci and multi-locus sequence typing (mlst) of conserved hypothetical genes. the genetic relationships among the strains inferred by each  of the methods were similar, revealing three different clusters of l. johnsonii strains, each cluster consisting of strains from a different host, i.e. chickens, humans or mice. conclusions: our typing results support phylogenetic separation of l. johnsonii strains isolated from different animal hosts, suggesting specificity of l. johnsonii strains to their hosts. taken together with the trflp results, that indicated the association of specific lab species with the host taxonomy, our study supports co-evolution of the host and its intestinal lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == change of intestinal microbiota with elemental diet and its impact on therapeutic effects in a murine model of chronic colitis.
AB  == elemental diet (ed) has been used as an enteral nutritional therapy for crohn's disease. however, the precise mechanisms of ed remain unclear. in interleukin-10  (il-10)-deficient cell-transferred mice, we investigated the change of intestinal microbiota with ed using molecular terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis and culture method, and evaluated its influence on therapeutic effects of ed. ed significantly suppressed intestinal inflammation. the total amount of bacteria in colitis mice fed the regular diet was higher than in normal mice but decreased in colitis mice fed ed. t-rflp profiles of the ed group markedly differed from those of the regular diet groups. the diversity of bacterial species in the ed group decreased to 60% of that found in the regular diet groups. among the cultivated bacteria, the change in lactic acid bacteria composition was remarkable. lactobacillus reuteri and l. johnsonii decreased and  enterococcus faecalis and e. durans increased in the ed group. the culture supernatant of l. reuteri isolates induced significant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and il-6 activity in raw 264 cells, while the culture supernatant of e. faecalis and e. durans barely induced their activity. these data suggested that reduction in amount and diversity of intestinal microbiota and decrease of proinflammatory cytokines via a change in composition of lactic acid bacteria by ed seem to contribute to reduction of bowel inflammation in this model.

TI  == biological and genetic classification of canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == to investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive lab and bifidobacteria (bf) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, and streptococcus. the lab and bf isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on sds-page protein profile analysis of whole cells. furthermore, partial 16s rdna sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. the identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus lactobacillus  (78.8%), seven species to the genus bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus enterococcus (11.6%), one species of streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). in particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were l. reuteri, l. animalis, and l. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. besides these, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, and streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. the sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the ddbj and the similarity was above 97.2%. their partial 16s rrna genes were registered in the ddbj.

TI  == differential inflammatory mediator response in vitro from murine macrophages to lactobacilli and pathogenic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == chronic active colitis (including inflammatory bowel disease - ibd) is maintained by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. certain intestinal bacterial strains  may induce colitis, whereas some strains (e.g. lactobacillus spp.) show a protective effect in colitis owing to their anti-inflammatory activity. in this study, we have examined the production of selected inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ros), nitric oxide (no) and the expression of haeme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) by murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated in vitro by the intestinal bacterial strains, isolated from mice with colitis. lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. animalis/murinus) and two potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis) induced the production of substantial amounts of cytokines with a strain specific profile. despite some interstrain differences, all lactobacilli induced production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-10(high), il-6(low), il-12p70(low)). conversely, e. faecalis and e. coli induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha, il-12p70), the cytokines essential for chronic ibd. macrophages released comparably substantial amounts of ros in response to all lactobacillus strains tested, while e. coli and e. faecalis ability to induce generation of ros was negligible. in contrast to ros, the production of no/no(2) (-) by macrophages activated with all bacterial strains tested was similar. moreover, for the first time, it has been shown that intestinal bacteria differed in their ability to induce expression of ho-1, a stress-inducible enzyme with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. the beneficial immunoregulatory properties of candidate probiotic bacteria for the treatment of ibd are discussed.

TI  == diversity of the genus lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

TI  == molecular analysis of a chromosome-carried erm(b) gene and its flanking insertion points in lactobacillus johnsonii g41.
AB  == an erm(b) gene carried on the lactobacillus johnsonii g41 chromosome and the upstream and downstream regions were fully sequenced. apparently, a 1,495-bp segment of pre25 from enterococcus faecalis carrying the erm(b) gene became inserted, by an unknown mechanism, into the l. johnsonii chromosome.

TI  == lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  == aims: to examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. methods and results: the crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. the isolates were identified using tdna-pcr. lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. a lactobacillus species related to l. fermentum and l. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. three pigeons carried enterococcus cecorum. minor species found were e. columbae, e. faecalis,  e. hirae, l. johnsonii, l. salivarius, and streptococcus gallolyticus. a description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the l. agilis pigeon strains. conclusions, significance and impact of the study: l. agilis is found to be the main component of the lab flora in the pigeon crop.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

TI  == utilization of the leucocin a export system in leuconostoc gelidum for production of a lactobacillus bacteriocin.
AB  == the lactacin f complex, composed of lafa and lafx peptides, is produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi 11088 (atcc 11506) and is active against various lactobacilli and enterococcus faecalis. the genetic determinants encoding the lactacin f peptides, lafa and lafx, are organized in a chromosomal operon comprised of genes lafa, lafx, and orfz. the lactacin f operon was introduced into leuconostoc (lc.) gelidum ual187-22 which produces leucocin a. leucocin a, a plasmid-encoded bacteriocin, inhibits e. faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, and other lactic acid bacteria. the culture supernatant of the leuconostoc transformant containing the lactacin f operon inhibited both lactacin f-and leucocin a-sensitive indicators. concurrent expression of both bacteriocins did not alter the production of native leucocin a. additive inhibitory effects due to the presence of both bacteriocins were not observed. an isogenic derivative of ual187-22, which has lost the leucocin-encoding plasmid, was unable to produce active lactacin f when transformed with the appropriate recombinant plasmid. the  ability of lc. gelidum ual187-22 to produce lactacin f demonstrates that the export system for leucocin a is capable of producing both bacteriocins simultaneously.

TI  == heterologous expression of the lactacin f peptides by carnobacterium piscicola lv17.
AB  == the lactacin f complex, composed of lafa and lafx peptides, is produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi 11088 and is active against five other lactobacillus  species and enterococcus faecalis. the genetic determinants encoding the lactacin f complex are organized in a 1-kb polycistronic operon which comprises three genes, lafa, lafx, and orfz (encoding the putative immunity protein). the lafa and lafx genes encode the bacteriocin precursors with n-terminal extensions characterized by a gly-gly-1*xaa+1 cleavage site (*). the gly-gly motif is conserved in several other bacteriocins, including carnobacteriocins a, bm1, and  b2. carnobacterium piscicola lv17 produces carnobacteriocins which are active against listeria monocytogenes and other lactic acid bacteria. in this study, the lactacin f operon was introduced into c. piscicola lv17. the transformants produced lactacin f concurrently with the carnobacteriocins. when the lafa and lafx genes were separated and cloned individually into lv17, production of either lafa or lafx by c. piscicola lv17 was detected by complementation with l. johnsonii clones producing lafx or lafa, respectively. transformants of c. piscicola lv17 which produced lactacin f, lafa, or lafx, in combination with the  carnobacteriocins, were assayed for an increased and expanded inhibitory spectrum. the recombinant organisms were only active against lactacin f- and carnobacteriocin-sensitive strains. a plasmidless derivative of lv17 which does not produce the carnobacteriocins failed to produce lactacin f, lafa, or lafx when transformed with the appropriate recombinant plasmids. the ability of c. piscicola lv17 to produce lactacin f demonstrates that the machinery for the carnobacteriocins is capable of processing and exporting bacteriocins from both systems.

TI  == kinetic studies of the action of lactacin f, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii that forms poration complexes in the cytoplasmic membrane.
AB  == the bacteriocin lactacin f is bactericidal against lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, and enterococcus faecalis. activity against l. delbrueckii was recently shown to be dependent on two peptides, lafa and lafx, which are encoded within the lactacin f operon (t. r. klaenhammer, fems microbiol. rev. 12:39-87, 1993). it has been proposed that two peptides form an active lactacin f complex. in this study, the action of lactacin f against e. faecalis atcc 19443 and the effects of various environmental parameters were investigated in detail. addition of lactacin f induced the loss of k+ from cells  of l. delbrueckii, lactobacillus johnsonii 88-4, and e. faecalis, while the lactacin f producer l. johnsonii vpi 11088 was not affected by the bacteriocin. lactacin f caused an immediate loss of cellular k+, depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane, and hydrolysis of internal atp in e. faecalis. lactacin f induced loss of k+ in 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide-treated cells, indicating that pores are formed in the absence of a proton motive force. atp hydrolysis was not due to dissipation of the proton motive force but was most likely caused by efflux of inorganic phosphate, resulting in a shift of the atp hydrolysis equilibrium. action of lactacin f was optimal at acidic ph values and  was reduced in the presence of di- and trivalent cations. the lanthanide gadolinium (gd3+) prevented action of lactacin f completely at a concentration of 0.2 mm. lactacin f-induced loss of cell k+ was severely reduced at low temperatures, presumably as a result of increased ordering of the lipid hydrocarbon chains in the cytoplasmic membrane.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
