TI  - An in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. The agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. In this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic Gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The time-kill experiment was performed using Anaerobe Broth medium. The drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/L for linezolid, 2mg/L for clindamycin, and 8mg/L for metronidazole. Samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the Bioscience International Autospiral DW. Exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. Plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees C). The species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (2), B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. varium, Prevotella melaninogenica, Clostridium perfringens, Eubacterium lentum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). The activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. As expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. Metronidazole yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three strains. Linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. The profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.
TI  - In vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against 502 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In a previous study, we compared HMR 3004 with azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin against 502 anaerobic bacteria using NCCLS-approved procedures. This report extends this study by reporting the activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against these strains. Telithromycin inhibited 10% of Bacteroides fragilis, 50% of other B. fragilis group organisms and 93% of other Bacteroides spp. Telithromycin inhibited all Porphyromonas spp. and 98% of Prevotella spp. Activity against Bilophila wadsworthia (85-96%) was excellent. Telithromycin was not active against the Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium group. Telithromycin inhibited 100% of Clostridium perfringens, 46-56% of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium ramosum and approximately 90% of non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - In vitro activity of DU-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of a new quinolone agent, DU-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of DU-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin, metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. DU-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every group of organisms. MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis (57), other B. fragilis group species (84), Bilophila wadsworthia (15), Clostridium species (27) (including C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum), Fusobacterium nucleatum (16), Fusobacterium mortiferum-F. varium group species (10), Peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and Prevotella species (25).
TI  - Effect of CO2 on susceptibilities of anaerobes to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin.
AB  - The Oxyrase agar dilution method (Oxyrase, Inc., Mansfield, Ohio), which provides an anaerobic environment without added CO2, was compared with the reference agar dilution method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (anaerobic chamber with 10% CO2) to test the susceptibilities of 302 gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin. For erythromycin, the overall MIC for 50% of isolates tested (MIC50) was 0.5 micrograms/ml and the MIC90 was 8.0 micrograms/ml by the Oxyrase method, whereas they were 4.0 and 64.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, under standard anaerobic conditions with CO2. At a breakpoint of 4.0 micrograms/ml, 88% of strains were susceptible to erythromycin by the Oxyrase method, whereas 63% were susceptible in the chamber. The corresponding MIC50s and MIC90s of azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin by the Oxyrase method were 0.5 and 8.0, 0.25 and 4.0, and 0.5 and 16.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, whereas in the chamber they were 4.0 and > 64.0, 2.0 and 64.0, and 2.0 and 64.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. At a breakpoint of 8.0 micrograms/ml for these three drugs, 89, 92, and 85% of the isolates, respectively, were susceptible by the Oxyrase method, whereas 67%, 72, and 68% of the isolates, respectively, were susceptible in the chamber. Most strains resistant to all four compounds by both methods were Bacteroides distasonis, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium varium and non-Clostridium perfringens Clostridium species. Results of the study may lead to a reappraisal of the role played by macrolides and azalides in the treatment of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Patterns of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among anaerobic bacterial isolates in the United States.
AB  - The activity of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria has generally been moderate to poor. Nalidixic acid and cinoxacin show poor activity against almost all anaerobes. Norfloxacin and enoxacin exhibit poor anaerobic activity (MIC90, 8- > 256 micrograms/mL) except against Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and some eubacteria. Norfloxacin is slightly more active than enoxacin against some Bacteroides species. While ciprofloxacin is more active than earlier fluoroquinolones against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 4-16 micrograms/mL), fusobacteria, and peptostreptococci, its activity is often variable and its MIC90 is frequently close to the maximal level attainable in serum. Ofloxacin is active against B. fragilis (MIC90, 4-8 micrograms/mL) but not against other species of the B. fragilis group (MIC90, 8-32 micrograms/mL); other anaerobes (e.g., peptostreptococci and fusobacteria) are generally susceptible to < or = 8 micrograms of ofloxacin/mL. Several newer quinolones exhibit improved anaerobic activity (although the studies yielding relevant data have often used diverse methods, small numbers and varieties of isolates, and different breakpoints). CI-960 and WIN 57273 inhibit 95% of strains tested at < or = 2 micrograms/mL. CI-990, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin inhibit most anaerobes at < or = 2 micrograms/mL, but clustering around the breakpoint and strain variability have been noted. CI-990 is active against more than 85% of B. fragilis strains (MIC90, 4 micrograms/mL), but other species of the B. fragilis group often require > 4 micrograms/mL for inhibition; Prevotella bivia, Fusobacterium varium, and Fusobacterium ulcerans are usually resistant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
TI  - The role of Escherichia coli haemolysin in the pathogenic synergy of colonic bacteria in subcutaneous abscess formation in mice.
AB  - The growth of nine species of colonic bacteria--Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus and Bifidobacterium adolescentis--was examined after concomitant injection to form experimental subcutaneous abscesses in mice. Injection of a mixture of c. 10(5) cfu of each of the first five strains (E. coli, Ent. faecalis, B. ovatis, F. varium and C. perfringens) resulted in abscess formation in all mice tested when the E. coli strain was haemolytic. E. coli and B. ovatus multiplied and reached a maximum population of c. 10(8) cfu/abscess. When non-haemolytic E. coli was used, injection of greater than or equal to 10(7) cfu was required for abscess formation. The inclusion of partially purified E. coli haemolysin (125 HU50) with c. 10(5) cfu of bacteria including non-haemolytic E. coli resulted in abscess formation in most mice tested. These results indicate that E. coli haemolysin is one factor that may potentiate pathogenic synergy among colonic bacteria especially between E. coli and B. ovatus, during abscess formation.
TI  - Potent antagonism of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium,  and Enterococcus faecalis, alone or in combination, for enteropathogens in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  - Interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus, and Fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae serogroup non O1, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (MCM). Potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. The four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. The seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. In contrast, Y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. Sh. Flexneri and Staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of E. coli alone. C. perfringens, V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae serogroup non O1 were excluded in the presence of E. coli with B. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. S. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. When the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, C. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. Sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.
TI  - Investigation of the immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with Crohn's disease.
AB  - The immune response to aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria in a patient with Crohn's disease with an intestinal fistula was investigated with various serological techniques. Two aerobic bacterial species, E. dispar and P. mirabilis, and four strict anaerobic bacterial species, B. fragilis ss. fragilis, F. varium and two different strains of C. perfringens, were isolated from fistula secretion of the patient. These strains were used as antigens for tube agglutination, passive hemagglutination, indirect immunofluorescence and immune hemolysis assays with serum specimens obtained before and after operation of the patient. Immune responses were demonstrated to the aerobic as well as to the anaerobic bacterial strains isolated from the patient's fistula. In connection with the operation an active immune response was demonstrated to the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates. Antibodies belonging to IgG and IgA took part in the active immune response while IgM was very little involved. Antibodies responsible for passive hemagglutination reactions were resistant to treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol. Antibodies to aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative rods were shown to have complement fixing activity. The importance of the demonstrated antibodies for the host's defence against normal intestinal microorganisms and the inflammatory reaction as a consequence of chronic antigenic stimulation in the diseased part of the intestine in patients with Crohn's disease is discussed.
