TI  == helicobacter acinonyx sp. nov., isolated from cheetahs with gastritis.
AB  == four strains of a novel helicobacter species were isolated from the stomachs of cheetahs (acinonyx jubilatus) with gastritis. these isolates were phenotypically  similar to helicobacter pylori. the isolates were gram-negative, spiral bacteria  which grew under microaerophilic conditions at 37 degrees c, but not at 25 or 42  degrees c, and produced urease, catalase, oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. the isolates did not ferment glucose, mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, rhamnose, sucrose, melibiose, amygdalin, or arabinose; hydrolyze hippurate or indoxyl acetate; or reduce nitrate. they did not produce h2s from triple sugar iron agar, and they did not grow in the presence of 1.0% glycine or 1.5% nacl. they were resistant to nalidixic acid and sensitive to cephalothin and metronidazole. cells were typically 0.3 by 2.0 microns and possessed tufts of two to five sheathed, monopolar flagella. the g+c content of strain 90-119 was 30 mol%. cluster analysis of densitometry scans of polyacrylamide protein gels revealed more than 70% similarity of the cheetah isolates to h. pylori, less than 60% similarity to helicobacter felis, and less than 50% similarity to helicobacter mustelae. complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for two of the cheetah isolates. phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the cheetah sequences to those of 19 reference strains, including h. pylori, h. felis (two strains), h. mustelae, helicobacter muridarum, "flexispira  rappini," wolinella succinogenes, campylobacter coli, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter curvus, campylobacter fetus, campylobacter hyointestinalis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter lari, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum subsp. bubulus, a campylobacter sp. (pig isolate), [bacteroides] gracilis, and [bacteroides] ureolyticus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == longitudinal monitoring of humoral antibody in subjects with destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == fifty-one subjects (16-61 years old) with evidence of prior destructive periodontal disease were monitored clinically and immunologically at bi-monthly intervals for up to 5 yr. periodontal disease activity, determined as new attachment loss, was detected in 33 of these subjects. only 4 of 51 subjects failed to show an elevated serum antibody level to any of the 18 subgingival species tested. the antibody level threshold established for periodontally healthy subjects was exceeded most often in diseased subjects with serum antibody to actinobacillus sp., p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia in that order. in general, most serum antibody levels to subgingival species remained relatively consistent for periods as long as 5 yr. however, major increases and decreases in antibody could be detected to at most one or two species in individual subjects. in addition, prolonged, steady increases and decreases in antibody to specific species could be detected in certain subjects. these findings suggest that major changes occurring in serum antibody may reflect fluctuations in the nature of the infection. differences were observed in the antibody level to specific species when subjects were divided into subsets on the basis of clinical criteria. these included high levels of antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 in ljp and rpp subjects and to  a. actinomycetemcomitans 29523 in ljp and gjp subjects.

TI  == revision of campylobacter, helicobacter, and wolinella taxonomy: emendation of generic descriptions and proposal of arcobacter gen. nov.
AB  == hybridization experiments were carried out between dnas from more than 70 strains of campylobacter spp. and related taxa and either 3h-labeled 23s rrnas from reference strains belonging to campylobacter fetus, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter sputorum, campylobacter coli, and campylobacter nitrofigilis, an unnamed campylobacter sp. strain, and a wolinella succinogenes strain or 3h- or 14c-labeled 23s rrnas from 13 gram-negative reference strains. an immunotyping analysis of 130 antigens versus 34 antisera of campylobacters and related taxa was also performed. we found that all of the named campylobacters and related taxa belong to the same phylogenetic group, which we name rrna superfamily vi and which is far removed from the gram-negative bacteria allocated to the five rrna superfamilies sensu de ley. there is a high degree of heterogeneity within this rrna superfamily. organisms belonging to rrna superfamily vi should be reclassified in several genera. we propose that the emended genus campylobacter should be limited to campylobacter fetus, campylobacter hyointestinalis, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter mucosalis, campylobacter sputorum, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, campylobacter lari, and "campylobacter  upsaliensis." wolinella curva and wolinella recta are transferred to the genus campylobacter as campylobacter curvus comb. nov. and campylobacter rectus comb. nov., respectively. bacteroides gracilis and bacteroides ureolyticus are generically misnamed and are closely related to the genus campylobacter. campylobacter nitrofigilis, campylobacter cryaerophila, and an unnamed campylobacter sp. strain constitute a new genus, for which the name arcobacter is proposed; this genus contains two species, arcobacter nitrofigilis comb. nov. (type species) and arcobacter cryaerophilus comb. nov. wolinella succinogenes so  far is the only species of the genus wolinella. the genus helicobacter is also emended; campylobacter cinaedi and campylobacter fennelliae are included in this  genus as helicobacter cinaedi comb. nov. and helicobacter fennelliae comb. nov.,  respectively. the genus "flexispira," with "flexispira rappini" as the only species, is closely related to the genus helicobacter. the free-living, sulfur-reducing campylobacters do not belong to any of these genera; they probably constitute a distinct genus within rrna superfamily vi.

TI  == bacteroides gracilis, an important anaerobic bacterial pathogen.
AB  == clinical isolates of agar-pitting, formate-fumarate-requiring, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were recharacterized in consideration of the species descriptions of bacteroides ureolyticus and the newly described b. gracilis, campylobacter concisus, and wolinella sp. during an 11-year period, 7.5% (101 of  1,341) of all specimens yielding anaerobes were found to contain an organism in this group. of the 71 isolates that were available for study, 43 were b. ureolyticus, 23 were b. gracilis, and 5 were in the wolinella-c. concisus group.  the role in infection and patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility for b. ureolyticus and b. gracilis were studied. review of the clinical data indicated that 83% of b. gracilis strains were recovered from patients with serious visceral or head and neck infection, whereas 73% of b. ureolyticus isolates were  recovered from superficial soft-tissue or bone infections. the strains of b. ureolyticus were uniformly susceptible to the tested antimicrobial agents. b. gracilis, however, showed some striking resistance, with penicillin active against only 67% and the cephalosporins active against 67 to 84% of the isolates  tested. the association of b. gracilis with serious deep-tissue infection, coupled with the relatively high frequency of antibiotic resistance, indicates that it is an important, previously unrecognized, pathogen.
