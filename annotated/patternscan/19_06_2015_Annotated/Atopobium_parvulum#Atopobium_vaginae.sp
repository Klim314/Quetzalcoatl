TI  == fine-scale analysis of 16s rrna sequences reveals a high level of taxonomic diversity among vaginal atopobium spp.
AB  == although vaginal microbial communities of some healthy women have high proportions of atopobium vaginae, the genus atopobium is more commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis, a syndrome associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. genetic differences within atopobium species may explain why single species can be associated with both health and disease. we used 16s rrna gene sequences from previously published studies to explore the taxonomic diversity of the genus atopobium in vaginal microbial communities of healthy women. although a. vaginae  was the species most commonly found, we also observed three other atopobium species in the vaginal microbiota, one of which, a. parvulum, was not previously  known to reside in the human vagina. furthermore, we found several potential novel species of the genus atopobium and multiple phylogenetic clades of a. vaginae. the diversity of atopobium found in our study, which focused only on samples from healthy women, is greater than previously recognized, suggesting that analysis of samples from women with bv would yield even more diversity. classification of microbes only to the genus level may thus obfuscate differences that might be important to better understand health or disease.

TI  == susceptibility testing of atopobium vaginae for dequalinium chloride.
AB  == background: atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis are major markers for bacterial vaginosis. we aimed to determine the mic and mbc range of the broad-spectrum anti-infective and antiseptic dequalinium chloride for 28 strains, belonging to 4 species of the genus atopobium, i.e. a. vaginae, a. minutum, a. rimae and a. parvulum. methods: the mic was determined with a broth microdilution assay. results: the mic and mbc for atopobium spp. for dequalinium chloride ranged between < 0.0625 and 2 mug/ml. conclusions: this study demonstrated that dequalinium chloride inhibits and kills clinical isolates of a. vaginae at concentrations similar to those of clindamycin and lower than those of metronidazole.
