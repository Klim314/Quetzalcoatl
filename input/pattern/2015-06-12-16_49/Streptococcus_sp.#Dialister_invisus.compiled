TI  - Preliminary molecular analysis of bacterial composition in periapical lesions with primary endodontic infections of deciduous teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial composition of periapical lesions in deciduous teeth has not been well documented. This study was designed to explore the bacterial compositions, especially the dominant bacteria in periapical lesions using 16S rRNA sequencing. METHODS: Tissue samples were collected from 11 periapical lesions in deciduous teeth with primary endodontic infections. DNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed using 16S rRNA cloning and sequencing for the identification of bacteria. RESULTS: All DNA samples were positive for 16S rRNA gene PCR. One hundred and fifty-one phylotypes from 810 clones were identified to eight phyla, and each sample contained an average of 25.9 phylotypes. In addition, 59 phylotypes were detected in more than two samples, and Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum (8/11), Dialister (D.) invisus (8/11), Campylobacter (C.) gracilis (7/11), Escherichia (E.) coli DH1 (6/11), Aggregatibacter (A.) segnis (6/11), and Streptococcus (S.) mitis (6/11) were the most prevalent species. Furthermore, 45 as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic periapical lesions in deciduous teeth contained polymicrobial infections. F. nucleatum, D. invisus, C. gracilis, E. coli DH1, A. segnis, and S. mitis were the most prevalent species detected by 16S rRNA sequencing.
TI  - Microbiological diversity of peri-implantitis biofilm by Sanger sequencing.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To examine the microbial diversity associated with implants with or without peri-implantitis and to identify differences between the bacterial communities in these clinical conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty subjects were assigned to a Control group consisting of subjects with healthy implants and a Test group consisting of subjects with peri-implantitis sites, as well as a healthy implant site (n = 10/group). In the Test group, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of the diseased implant. In both groups, samples were collected from one site around a healthy implant. DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced, and the phylotypes were identified by comparison with known 16S rRNA sequences. RESULTS: The phylogenetic identity of 1387 16S rRNA gene clones was determined. Healthy implants demonstrated higher proportions of Actinomyces, Atopobium, Gemella, Kingella and Rothia and lower levels of Campylobacter, Desulfobulbus, Dialister, Eubacterium, Filifactor, Mitsukella, Porphyromonas and Pseudoramibacter (Mann-Whitney U-test; P < 0.05). Fusobacterium nucleatum, Dialister invisus, Streptococcus sp. human oral taxon (HOT) 064, Filifactor alocis and Mitsuokella sp. HOT 131 presented a higher mean proportion, while Veillonella dispar, Actinomyces meyeri, Granulicatella adiacens showed lower mean proportions in the peri-implantitis sites when compared with healthy implants in both the Control and Test groups (Mann-Whitney U-test; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Marked differences were observed in the composition of the subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. The biofilm associated with peri-implantitis harbored more pathogenic bacterial species from the orange complex and other "unusual" putative pathogens, such as F. alocis, D. invisus and Mitsuokella sp. HOT 131.
TI  - Molecular analysis of 16S rRNA genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  - PURPOSE: Small subunit rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Template DNA prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16S rRNA bacterial and archaeal genes. Amplicons were cloned, sequenced, and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the microorganisms present. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11 phyla, including members of the uncultivable TM7, SR1, and Chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate Synergistetes and Spirochaetes. Dialister invisus, Filifactor alocis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella denticola, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. Dialister invisus and F nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms. The archaeal species, Methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. Several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.
TI  - Analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult Norwegian patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult Norwegian patients. METHODS: Samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21) apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). DNA was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in all cases. In teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were Dialister invisus (71%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and Porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). In chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were P. endodontalis (100%), D. invisus (89%), Parvimonas micra (78%), and Solobacterium moorei (78%). In teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were D. invisus, P. endodontalis, S. moorei, Propionibacterium acnes, and Streptococcus species (all in 69%). None of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (P > .05), except for Selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (P = .04). No taxa were found in significantly higher levels in any conditions (P > .05). Cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. CONCLUSIONS: Although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. Therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.
TI  - Comparison of the in vivo antimicrobial effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite and  chlorhexidine used as root canal irrigants: a molecular microbiology study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this clinical study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) when used as irrigants during treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. METHODS: Forty-seven single-rooted single-canal teeth with necrotic pulps and asymptomatic apical periodontitis were selected for this study according to stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria. Bacterial samples were taken at the baseline (S1) and after (S2) chemomechanical preparation using 2.5% NaOCl (n = 30) or 0.12% CHX (n = 17) as the irrigant. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal presence was evaluated by broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 28 candidate endodontic pathogens. RESULTS: All S1 samples were PCR positive for bacterial presence but negative for both archaea and fungi. Both NaOCl- and CHX-based protocols were significantly effective in reducing the bacterial levels and number of taxa. No significant differences were observed between them in all tested parameters including the incidence of negative PCR results in S2 (40% for NaOCl vs 47% for CHX, p = 0.8), reduction in the number of taxa per canal (p = 0.3), and reduction in the bacterial levels (p = 0.07). The most prevalent taxa in S2 samples from the NaOCl group were Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus species, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Selenomonas sputigena. In the CHX group, the most prevalent taxa in S2 were Dialister invisus, Actinomyces israelii, Prevotella baroniae, Propionibacterium acidifaciens, and Streptococcus species. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment protocols using irrigation with either NaOCl or CHX succeeded in significantly reducing the the number of bacterial taxa and their levels in infected root canals, with no significant difference between these substances.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - The microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  - As the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. We hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. Abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. Associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. The most prevalent taxa were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Porphyromonas endodontalis. Other frequently found taxa included Olsenella uli, streptococci, Eikenella corrodens, some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (Bacteroidetes clone X083 and Synergistes clone BA121), and newly named species (Prevotella baroniae and Dialister invisus). Several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. Findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.
TI  - Microorganisms in root canal-treated teeth from a German population.
AB  - Posttreatment apical periodontitis is usually associated with persistent or secondary intraradicular infection. This study evaluated the presence and relative levels of 28 bacterial taxa in treated root canals of teeth with posttreatment apical periodontitis from German patients using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene probes in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also performed to detect Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. Bacterial DNA was detected in all samples. Twenty of the 28 taxon-specific probes tested were reactive with at least one sample. Taxa detected more frequently included Streptococcus species (47%), Lactobacillus species (35%), Dialister invisus (29%), Eubacterium infirmum (29%), Prevotella intermedia (29%), Selenomonas sputigena (29%), Synergistes oral clone BA121 (29%), and Treponema denticola (29%). Only eight taxa were present at levels >10(5). Of these, streptococci and T. denticola were the most prevalent. Species-specific PCR detected E. faecalis in 47% of the cases and C. albicans in 6%. Findings of this study confirm the strong association between persistent/secondary intraradicular infection and posttreatment apical periodontitis. Most cases harbored a mixed infection, and E. faecalis, if present, was never the most dominant species in the consortium. Several other bacterial taxa were detected, and an involvement with the etiology of posttreatment apical periodontitis is suspected.
TI  - Bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. METHODS: Samples collected from five infected root canals were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers. Products of these PCRs were cloned and sequenced. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used as a screening method to reduce the number of clones necessary for DNA sequencing. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. In total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. Olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Dialister invisus, Lachnospiraceae oral clone, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. The majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example Tannerella forsythia, Shuttleworthia satelles and Filifactor alocis. Some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus and Lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.
TI  - Culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  - Renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. In this study, a culture-independent 16S rRNA-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. Similarly sized amplicons encompassing the V6 to V8 region of the 16S rRNA were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) (WAVE System). Artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. We evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and DHPLC generated peak profiles. However, for culture-negative specimens, DHPLC facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. DNA sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. Thus, in PCR-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as Corynebacterium urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including Anaerococcus lactolyticus, Bacteroides vulgatus, Dialister invisus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus iners, Leptotrichia amnionii, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella ruminicola, Rahnella aquatilis, and Streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. The method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both DHPLC-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. A detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.
