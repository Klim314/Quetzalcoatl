TI  == peptidoglycan recognition protein 3 (pglyrp3) has an anti-inflammatory role in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == intestinal epithelial cells produce cytokines in response to bacterial peptidoglycan (pgn), which is detected by several classes of pattern-recognition  receptors (prrs) as peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pglyrps), toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) and nod receptors. all types of pglyrps recognize bacterial peptidoglycan and function in antibacterial innate immunity. in this study, we investigated the role of pglyrp3 in the response of intestinal epithelial cells (caco-2) to pgn from pathogenic (staphylococcus aureus), opportunistic pathogenic (micrococcus luteus) and non-pathogenic (bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg) bacteria found in the gut as commensals or in gastroenteritis. all  pgns induced the proinflammatory cytokines il-12p35, il-8 and tnf-alpha and, time-dependently, pglyrp3, at both the transcription and protein levels. in this  context, no differences were observed among the distinct pgn obtained from different bacterial sources. the inflammatory response to pgn is mediated via the tlr2 pathway, since blocking this pathway by inhibiting myd88 reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. in addition, pglyrp3 overexpression suppressed, while pglyrp3 knocking down enhanced the expression of pgn-induced inflammatory cytokines. it is concluded that pgn stimulates inflammatory responses in the intestinal epithelia through activation of the tlr pathway. pglyrp3 is also stimulated by pgn and has, in contrast to activation of the tlr pathway, an anti-inflammatory effect.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from canine faeces.
AB  == aims: lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated and sequenced from the faeces of healthy dogs. five of these strains were selected and further characterized to clarify the potential of these strains as probiotics for canine. methods and results: lab were found in 67% (14/21) of the canine faeces samples when plated on lactobacilli selective media without acetic acid. out of 13 species identified with partial 16s rrna gene sequencing, lactobacillus fermentum lab8, l. mucosae lab12, l. rhamnosus lab11, l. salivarius lab9 and weissella confusa lab10 were selected as candidate probiotic strains based on their frequency, quantity in faeces, growth density, acid tolerance and antimicrobial activity. the minimal inhibitory concentration values of these isolates were determined for 14 antibiotics. l. salivarius lab9, w. confusa lab10 and l. mucosae lab12 were viable in ph 2 for 4 h (mlbs), indicating tolerance to acidity and thus the potential to survive in gastrointestinal tract of the canine. the lab8-lab12 strains showed antimicrobial activity against micrococcus luteus a1 ncimb86166. conclusions: thirteen different lab species were found from the faecal microbiota of the healthy canines. five acid tolerant and antimicrobially active lab strains with the capacity to grow to high densities both aerobically and anaerobically were chosen to serve as candidate probiotics. significance and impact of the study: the selected lab strains are among the first host-specific lab with antimicrobial activity isolated from canines that could serve as potential probiotics for canine use.

TI  == mode of action of lactocin 160, a bacteriocin from vaginal lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == objectives: to determine the mechanism of antimicrobial action of lactocin 160, a bacteriocin produced by the healthy vaginal strain of lactobacillus rhamnosus, using an established model, with micrococcus luteus atcc 10420 as a test organism. methods: sensitivity of m. luteus to lactocin 160 was determined by the diffusion assay. loss of cellular atp in the lactocin-treated cells was elucidated using a commercially available atp determination kit (luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence assay). luminescence intensity as a reflection of atp quantity was determined using a luminometer. dissipation of membrane potential (deltapsi) was studied using fluorophore disc3(5) with the fluorescence spectrum sensitive to changes in deltapsi. results: lactocin 160 inhibited growth of m. luteus atcc 10420 at a concentration of 5 microg/ml. there were no significant changes in the intracellular atp level of m. luteus upon the  addition of 20 microg/ml of lactocin 160. however, the extracellular atp level increased significantly. this means that the treatment of cells with lactocin 160 resulted in an efflux of atp from inside the cells. therefore, a partially purified lactocin 160 preparation (16 microg /ml of the bacteriocin in the sample) killed sensitive cells and dissipated 3.12 +/- 0.36% of deltapsi. conclusion: lactocin 160 has a mode of action typical for bacteriocins. it disturbs the cellular membrane (deltapsi dissipation) and induces atp efflux, most likely because of the pore formation, which is a common mechanism of action  for many bacteriocins.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
