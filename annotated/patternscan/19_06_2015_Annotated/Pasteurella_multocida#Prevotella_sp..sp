TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == activities of hmr 3004 (ru 64004) and hmr 3647 (ru 66647) compared to those of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and eight other antimicrobial agents against unusual aerobic and anaerobic human and animal bite  pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue infections in humans.
AB  == the activities of hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 and comparator agents, especially macrolides, were determined by the agar dilution method against 262 aerobic and 120 anaerobic strains isolated from skin and soft tissue infections associated with human and animal bite wounds. hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were active against almost all aerobic and fastidious facultative isolates (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively) and against all anaerobes [bacteroides tectum, porphyromonas macacae (salivosa), prevotella heparinolytica, porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., and peptostreptococci] at < or = 0.25 and < or = 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, except  fusobacterium nucleatum (hmr 3004, mic90 = 16 microg/ml; hmr 3647, mic90 = 8 microg/ml) and other fusobacterium species (mic90, 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively). in general, hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were more active than any of the macrolides tested. azithromycin was more active than clarithromycin against all pasteurella species, including pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida, eikenella  corrodens, and fusobacterium species, while clarithromycin was more active than azithromycin against corynebacterium species, weeksella zoohelcum, b. tectum, and p. heparinolytica.

TI  == [phlegmon of the fore arm succeeding to a dog-bite : respective role of the miscellaneous bacteria involved in this mixed infection (author's transl)].
AB  == the authors report a case of a severe mixed infection (phlegmon of the fore arm)  succeeding to a dog bite. a complex flora has been isolated from this phlegmom :  pasteurella multocida, pasteurella pneumotropica, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces sp., bacteroides melaninogenicus, and a gram- bacteria related to group ii j. the pathogeny of such diseases is discussed, dwelling in one hand on  the part of synergistic development of these various germs and in the other hand  on the part played by saliva in the severity of animal or human bites. this kind  of wound requires careful disinfection and radical debridment without omitting a  preventive broad-spectrum antibiotherapy.
