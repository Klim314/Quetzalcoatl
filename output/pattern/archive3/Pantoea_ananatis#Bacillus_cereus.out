absolute configuration and antimicrobial activity of acylhomoserine lactones.
(s)-n-heptanoylhomoserine lactone is an uncommon acyl odd-chain natural product employed by many gram-negative bacteria as a signaling substance in chemical communication mechanisms known as quorum sensing. the absolute configuration determination of the metabolite produced by the phytopathogen pantoea ananatis serrano is reported herein. as with all other substances of this class, the lactone moiety possesses s configuration, corroborating the hypothesis that it shares the same biosynthetic pathway as the (s)-n-hexanoylhomoserine lactone and also that some luxi homologues can accept both hexanoyl- and heptanoyl-acp as precursors. evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of enantiomeric acylhomoserine lactones against three gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, and staphylococcus aureus) revealed important features between absolute configuration and antimicrobial activity. the n-heptanoylhomoserine lactone was considerably less active than the 3-oxo derivatives. surprisingly, non-natural (r)-n-(3-oxo-octanoyl)homoserine lactone was as active as the s enantiomer against b. cereus, while the synthetic racemic product was less active than either enantiomer.
