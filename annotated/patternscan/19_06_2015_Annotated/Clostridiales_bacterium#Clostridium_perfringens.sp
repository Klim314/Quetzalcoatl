TI  == two necrotic enteritis predisposing factors, dietary fishmeal and eimeria infection, induce large changes in the caecal microbiota of broiler chickens.
AB  == it is widely established that a high-protein fishmeal supplemented starter diet and eimeria infection can predispose birds to the development of clinical necrotic enteritis symptoms following clostridium perfringens infection. however, it has not been clearly established what changes these treatments cause to predispose birds to succumb to necrotic enteritis. we analysed caecal microbiota  of 4 groups of broilers (n=12) using deep pyrosequencing of 16s rdna amplicons: (1) control chicks fed a control diet, (2) eimeria infected chicks fed control diet, (3) chicks fed fishmeal supplemented diet and lastly (4) both fishmeal fed  and eimeria infected chicks. we found that the high-protein fishmeal diet had a strong effect on the intestinal microbiota similar to the previously reported effect of c. perfringens infection. we noted major changes in the prevalence of various lactobacilli while the total culturable lactobacillus counts remained stable. the ruminococcaceae, lachnospiraceae, unknown clostridiales and lactobacillaceae families were most affected by fishmeal with increases in a number of operational taxonomic units (otus) that had previously been linked to crohn's disease and reductions in otus known to be butyrate producers. eimeria induced very different changes in microbiota; ruminococcaceae groups were reduced in number and three unknown clostridium species were increased in abundance. additionally, eimeria did not significantly influence changes in ph, formic, propionic or isobutyric acid while fishmeal induced dramatic changes in all these measures. both fishmeal feeding and eimeria infection induced significant changes in the gut microbiota; these changes may play an important role in predisposing birds to necrotic enteritis.

TI  == germination of spores of bacillales and clostridiales species: mechanisms and proteins involved.
AB  == under conditions that are not conducive to growth, such as nutrient depletion, many members of the orders bacillales and clostridiales can sporulate, generating dormant and resistant spores that can survive in the absence of nutrients for years under harsh conditions. however, when nutrients are again present, these spores can return to active growth through the process of germination. many of the components of the spore germination machinery are conserved between spore forming members of the bacillales and clostridiales orders. however, recent studies have revealed significant differences between the germination of spores of clostridium perfringens and that of spores of a number of bacillus species, both in the proteins and in the signal transduction pathways involved. in this review, the roles of components of the spore germination machinery of c. perfringens and several bacillus species and the bioinformatic analysis of germination proteins in the bacillales and clostridiales orders are discussed and models for the germination of spores of these two orders are proposed.
