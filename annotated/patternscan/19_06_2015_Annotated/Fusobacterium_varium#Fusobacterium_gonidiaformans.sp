TI  == identification of a 43-kda outer membrane protein of fusobacterium necrophorum that exhibits similarity with pore-forming proteins of other fusobacterium species.
AB  == a pair of primers was designed in an attempt to amplify outer membrane protein (omp) gene of fusobacterium necrophorum based on nucleotide sequence of the omp of fusobacterium nucleatum. further analysis was performed to characterize its molecular properties and phylogeny in the genus fusobacterium. we identified a predicated 43kda outer membrane protein (43k omp) in f. necrophorum, which showed the same properties as other pore-forming proteins of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria according to analysis of signal peptide, at-rich, membrane-spanning region and conserved motifs. the predicated 43k omp exhibited 70.22%, 62.04%, 56.75%, 58.72%, 51.59%, 31.49% and 50.26% amino acid identity with the omps of f. nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, fusobacterium ucerans, fusobacterium periodonticum, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium gonidiaformans and f. necrophorum (hypothetical protein), respectively. 11 common conserved domains and 10 common variable domains were found among the 45 aligned omps of fusobacterium  species. distributions of the conserved and variable domains were highly associated with predicted membrane-spanning regions, cell surface exposed regions and b-cell epitope regions. phylogenetic analysis revealed the predicated 43k omp of f. necrophorum was closely related with the omps from f. nucleatum and f. periodonticum. these data will increase understanding of pathogenesis and genetic evolution of f. necrophorum.

TI  == fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  == a total of 243 strains of fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. the strains included 65 (27%) fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) fusobacterium varium, three (1%) fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) fusobacterium gonidiaformans. most fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. these included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. the organisms most commonly isolated with fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. (95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.

TI  == intrageneric relationships of members of the genus fusobacterium as determined by reverse transcriptase sequencing of small-subunit rrna.
AB  == the phylogenetic interrelationships of 14 members of the genus fusobacterium were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the 16s rrna sequences of these organisms. the sequence data revealed considerable intrageneric heterogeneity. the four species fusobacterium nucleatum (including f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, "f. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme," and "f. nucleatum subsp. animalis"), fusobacterium alocis, fusobacterium periodonticum, and fusobacterium simiae, which colonize oral cavities, exhibited high levels of sequence homology with each other and formed a distinct group within the genus. fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium varium,  and fusobacterium ulcerans also formed a phylogenetically coherent group, as did  the two species fusobacterium gonidiaformans and fusobacterium necrophorum. fusobacterium russii and fusobacterium necrogenes displayed no specific relationship with any of the other fusobacteria. the sequence data are discussed  in the context of previous physiological and chemical findings.

TI  == a pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of fusobacteria.
AB  == strains of fusobacteria (143) were examined by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (py-ms) with a horizon instruments pyms 200x. fusobacterium necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum, f. mortiferum, f. varium, f. gonidiaformans, f. naviforme, f. russii and leptotrichia buccalis were discriminated. strains of fusobacteria isolated from tropical ulcers, although similar to f. mortiferum in  conventional tests, were discriminated from each of these species in py-ms. identification of 416 spectra to species level agreed with conventional bacteriological methods in 91.8% of cases, was equivocal in 3.4% and disagreed in 4.8%. classification based on pyrolysis data resolved groups largely corresponding to the recognised species. however, f. nucleatum strains were divided between two distinct groups. the tropical ulcer strains were resolved as  a distinct homogeneous group. py-ms is a rapid, inexpensive and convenient procedure for characterisation of bacteria, with the capacity for a high throughput of samples, although the initial cost of the apparatus is high.

TI  == cell-wall-defective variants of fusobacterium.
AB  == the activity of antimicrobial agents against fusobacterium species has been reported as variable in the literature. for some strains, the inconsistency arises from difficulty in determining the endpoint of growth in agar dilution susceptibility tests. certain strains persist as a subtle haze beyond the levels  of antibiotic that permit conventional colonial growth. we have determined by light and electron microscopy that this haze represents the colonial growth of cell-wall-defective (cwd) variants of the parent fusobacterium. the cwd forms could be propagated indefinitely in hypertonic medium containing the antibiotic inducing agent. however, when the antibiotic was eliminated, the organisms would  revert to their native morphology. formation of cwd variants was observed in the  presence of cell-wall-active drugs (e.g., beta-lactam agents) but not with drugs  that work by a different mechanism (e.g., clindamycin or chloramphenicol). fourteen of 22 f. varium strains, 8 of 11 f. mortiferum strains, 2 of 10 f. gonidiaformans strains, and 1 of 4 of f. necrophorum strains could be induced to  a cwd form in vitro in the usual agar dilution susceptibility test. although the  clinical significance of cwd variants of fusobacterium is unknown, they may be a  source of confusion in interpreting agar dilution susceptibility tests.

TI  == pleomorphism of fusobacteria isolated from the cockroach hindgut.
AB  == fusobacteria are commonly isolated from the hindgut of the cockroach eublaberus posticus . eleven strains isolated from e. posticus by us were keyed to four species, fusobacterium necrophorum, f. varium , f. gonidiaformans , and f. prausnitzii , using current taxonomic criteria. with the exception of f. gonidiaformis , all species showed rods with swollen centers and large bodies. the pleomorphism of f. varium was examined by phase microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. the pleomorphic process begins with a gradual swelling at the center of the rod until a large round body is formed. some of these round bodies then fragment, giving rise to rod-shaped cells. when 10% yeast extract was added to growth media, pleomorphism was not induced. a dialyzable factor was found to account for this observation. fermentation of [1-14c]glutamic acid gives rise to butyrate labeled in the carboxyl carbon, indicating that butyrate is formed by the hydroxyglutarate pathway which may be characteristic for the genus fusobacterium.

TI  == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli: their role in infection and patterns of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. ii. little-known fusobacterium species and miscellaneous genera.
AB  == twenty infrequently reported species of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli other than fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium necrophorum, and members of the genus bacteroides were studied with regard to their role in infection and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. in addition, the literature regarding the recovery of these organisms from both the normal flora and infections of humans was reviewed. during a six-year period at the wadsworth clinical anaerobic bacteriology research laboratory (veterans administration wadsworth medical center, los angeles, calif.), 39 (6%) of 679 specimens obtained from anaerobic infections yielded "other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli" (ognab). fusobacterium naviforme, fusobacterium gonidiaformans, fusobacterium varium, fusobacterium mortiferum, and fusobacterium russii were the most commonly isolated ognab. most  of the ognab tested were resistant to erythromycin, and most strains, except for  f. varium, were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics and clindamycin. chloramphenicol and metronidazole were active against all strains of ognab tested. certain fusobacterium species are undoubtedly previously unrecognized members of the normal flora of the oropharynx, upper respiratory tract, or urogenital tract and may be present in infections derived from these floras.

TI  == fatty acids of fusobacterium species: taxonomic implications.
AB  == fatty acids of fusobacterium species were examined by gas-liquid chromatography.  fusobacterium nucleatum, f. necrophorum, f. mortiferum, f. gonidiaformans and f.  varium showed similar patterns, characterized by the presence of 3-hydroxytetradecanoate, n-tetradecanoate, hexadecenoate, n-hexadeconoate, ocadecenoate, n-octadecanoate and a component having the properties of octadecadienoate. fusobacterium nucleatum contained 3-hydroxyhexadecanoate as a distinctive character. simpler fatty acid patterns characterized by the absence of 3-hydroxytetradecanoate and other hydroxy fatty acids were observed in f. plauti, the single strain of f. prausnitzii and in the majority of strains classified as f. russii and f. naviforme. neither methyl-branched nor cyclopropane fatty acids could be detected in any of the strains examined. in addition to fatty acid methyl esters, the chromatographic profiles of all species except f. mortiferum, f. gonidiaformans and f. naviforme contained substantial amounts of fatty aldehyde dimethyl acetals of chain lengths c14 to c18.

TI  == fatty acids and neutral sugars present in lipopolysaccharides isolated from fusobacterium species.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) extracted from cells of fusobacterium necrophorum, f. mortiferum, f. gonidiaformans. varium and single strains of f. naviforme and f. russi were analysed for sugars and fatty acids. all preparations contained a monosaccharide tentatively identified as l-glycero-d-mannoheptose, but showed variation with respect to the presence of glucose, galactose, rhamnose and another heptose isomer, tentatively identified as l-glycero-d-mannoheptose. l-glycero-d-mannoheptose was a monosaccharide of great abundance in all lps examined. 2-keto-3-deoxy-octonate and glucosamine were present in all lps preparations. the fatty acids present were 3-hydroxy-tetradecanoic acid as the main component, and n-tetradecanoic acid. some lps contained n-hexadecanoic acid. all the strains of f. nucleatum contained 3-hydroxy-hexadecanoic acid as a group-specific lps constituent.
