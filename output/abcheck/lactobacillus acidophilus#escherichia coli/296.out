s-layer protein of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356: purification, expression  in escherichia coli, and nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene.
the cell surfaces of several lactobacillus species are covered by a regular layer composed of a single species of protein, the s-protein.
the 43-kda s-protein of the neotype strain lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, which originated from the pharynx of a human, was purified.
antibodies generated against purified s-protein were used to screen a lambda library containing chromosomal l. acidophilus atcc 4356 dna.
several phages showing expression of this s-protein in escherichia coli were isolated.
a 4.0-kb dna fragment of one of those phages hybridized to a probe derived from an internal tryptic fragment of the s-protein.
the slpa gene, coding for the surface layer protein, was located entirely on the 4.0-kb fragment as shown by deletion analysis.
the nucleotide sequence of the slpa gene was determined and appeared to encode a protein of 444 amino acids.
the first 24 amino acids resembled a putative secretion signal, giving rise to a mature s-protein of 420 amino acids (44.2 kda).
the predicted isoelectric point of 9.4 is remarkably high for an s-protein but is in agreement with the data obtained during purification.
the expression of the entire s-protein or of large, c-terminally truncated s-proteins is unstable in e. coli.
