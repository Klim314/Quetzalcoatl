TI  == genomics, evolution, and molecular epidemiology of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec).
AB  == the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) is a group of human and animal derived streptococci that are commensals (rumen and gastrointestinal tract), opportunistic pathogens or food fermentation associates. the classification of sbsec has undergone massive changes and currently comprises 7 (sub)species grouped into four branches based on sequences identities: the streptococcus gallolyticus, the streptococcus equinus, the streptococcus infantarius and the streptococcus alactolyticus branch. in animals, sbsec are causative agents for ruminal acidosis, potentially laminitis and infective endocarditis (ie). in humans, a strong association was established between bacteraemia, ie and colorectal cancer. especially the sbsec-species s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an emerging pathogen for ie and prosthetic joint infections. s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus and the s. infantarius branch are further associated with biliary and urinary tract infections. knowledge on pathogenic mechanisms is so far limited to colonization factors such as pili and biofilm formation. certain strain variants of s. gallolyticus subsp.  macedonicus and s. infantarius subsp. infantarius are associated with traditional dairy and plant-based food fermentations and display traits suggesting safety. however, due to their close relationship to virulent strains, their use in food fermentation has to be critically assessed. additionally, implementing accurate and up-to-date taxonomy is critical to enable appropriate treatment of patients and risk assessment of species and strains via recently developed multilocus sequence typing schemes to enable comparative global epidemiology. comparative genomics revealed that sbsec strains harbour genomics islands (gi) that seem acquired from other streptococci by horizontal gene transfer. in case of virulent strains these gi frequently encode putative virulence factors, in strains from food fermentation the gi encode functions that are pivotal for strain performance during fermentation. comparative genomics is a powerful tool to identify acquired pathogenic functions, but there is still an urgent need for more physiological and epidemiological data to understand sbsec-specific traits.

TI  == comparative genomics of the dairy isolate streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 against related members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  == background: within the genus streptococcus, only streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. members of the sbsec have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 to the other sbsec genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. results: despite the fact that the sbsec species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus infantarius cj18 and streptococcus pasteurianus atcc 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. in addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of s. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. analysis of the s. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy lactococcus lactis and s. thermophilus as potential donors. in addition, s. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in s. gallolyticus. for example, s. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of s. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy s. infantarius cj18, but also for the blood isolate s. pasteurianus atcc 43144. conclusions: our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of s. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. during this  process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. finally, s. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative sbsec virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == bacteraemia due to streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus is associated with digestive tract malignancies and resistance to macrolides and clindamycin.
AB  == objectives: this study was intended to delineate the association between digestive tract malignancies and bacteraemia due to streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus. methods: we reviewed the medical records and microbiological results of patients with bacteraemia due to streptococcus bovis during the period 2000-2012. species and subspecies identification of isolates originally classified as s. bovis was confirmed by 16s rrna sequencing and pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) assays. minimum inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution method. results: of the 172 s. bovis complex isolates obtained from 172 patients  (age range, <1-94 years, median age, 66) with bacteraemia, 31 isolates were identified to be s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus, 126 were s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus, and 15 were shown to be streptococcus infantarius. the majority (n = 104, 60%) of patients were male and had underlying malignancies (n = 87, 51%). bacteraemia due to s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus was significantly associated with endocarditis while s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus was more likely to be associated with malignancies of the digestive tract, including gastric, pancreatic, hepatobiliary and colorectal cancers. septic shock at presentation was the only factor associated with mortality among patients with bacteraemia due to either subspecies of s. bovis. isolates of s. gallolyticus subspecies pasteurianus had higher rates of resistance to macrolides and clindamycin than isolates of s. gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus. conclusion: extensive diagnostic work-up for digestive tract malignancies and trans-esophageal echocardiogram should be investigated in  patients with bacteraemia caused by s. gallolyticus.

TI  == novel bartonella infection in northern and southern sea otters (enhydra lutris kenyoni and enhydra lutris nereis).
AB  == since 2002, vegetative valvular endocarditis (vve), septicemia and meningoencephalitis have contributed to an unusual mortality event (ume) of northern sea otters in southcentral alaska. streptococcal organisms were commonly isolated from vegetative lesions and organs from these sea otters. bartonella infection has also been associated with bacteremia and vve in terrestrial mammals, but little is known regarding its pathogenic significance in marine mammals. our study evaluated whether streptococcus bovis/equinus (sb/e) and bartonella infections were associated with ume-related disease characterized by vve and septicemia in alaskan sea otter carcasses recovered 2004-2008. these bacteria were also evaluated in southern sea otters in california. streptococcus  bovis/equinus were cultured from 45% (23/51) of northern sea otter heart valves,  and biochemical testing and sequencing identified these isolates as streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli. one-third of sea otter hearts were co-infected with bartonella spp. our analysis demonstrated that sb/e was strongly associated with  ume-related disease in northern sea otters (p<0.001). while bartonella infection  was also detected in 45% (23/51) and 10% (3/30) of heart valves of northern and southern sea otters examined, respectively, it was not associated with disease. phylogenetic analysis of the bartonella its region allowed detection of two bartonella species, one novel species closely related to bartonella spp. jm-1, b. washoensis and candidatus b. volans and another molecularly identical to b. henselae. our findings help to elucidate the role of pathogens in northern sea otter mortalities during this ume and suggested that bartonella spp. is common in sea otters from alaska and california.

TI  == prevalence and comparison of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus in raw and fermented dairy products from east and west africa.
AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus are members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) associated with human infections. sbsec-related endocarditis was  furthermore associated with rural residency in southern europe. sbsec members are increasingly isolated as predominant species from fermented dairy products in europe, asia and africa. african variants of sii displayed dairy adaptations to lactose metabolism paralleling those of streptococcus thermophilus including genome decay. in this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of sii and possibly other sbsec members in dairy products of east and west africa in order to identify their habitat, estimate their importance in dairy fermentation processes and determine geographic areas affected by this potential health risk.  presumptive sbsec members were isolated on semi-selective m17 and sm agar media.  subsequent genotypic identification of isolates was based on rep-pcr fingerprinting and sbsec-specific16s rrna gene pcr assay. detailed identification was achieved through application of novel primers enhancing the binding stringency in partial groes/groel gene amplification and subsequent dna sequencing. the presence of s. thermophilus-like lacs and lacz genes in the sbsec isolates was determined to elucidate the prevalence of this dairy adaptation. isolates (n = 754) were obtained from 72 raw and 95 fermented milk samples from cote d'ivoire and kenya on semi-selective agar media. colonies of sii were not detected from raw milk despite high microbial titers of approximately 10(6)cfu/ml on m17 agar medium. however, after spontaneous milk fermentation sii was genotypically identified in 94.1% of kenyan samples and 60.8% of kenyan isolates. sii prevalence in cote d'ivoire displayed seasonal variations in samples from 32.3% (june) to 40.0% (dec/jan) and isolates from 20.5% (june) to 27.7% (dec/jan) present at titers of 10(6)-10(8)cfu/ml. lacs and lacz genes were detected in all  kenyan and 25.8% (june) to 65.4% (dec/jan) of ivorian sii isolates. regional differences in prevalence of sii and dairy adaptations were observed, but no clear effect of dairy animal, fermentation procedure and climate was revealed. conclusively, the high prevalence of sii in kenya, cote d'ivoire in addition to somalia, sudan and mali strongly indicates a pivotal role of sii in traditional african dairy fermentations potentially paralleling that of typical western dairy species s. thermophilus. putative health risks associated with the consumption of high amounts of live sii and potential different degrees of evolutionary adaptation or ecological colonization require further epidemiologic and genomic investigations, particularly in africa.

TI  == streptococcus bovis group and biliary tract infections: an analysis of 51 cases.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a well-known cause of endocarditis, but its role in other  infections has not been well described. we analysed prospectively all patients with biliary tract infections caused by s. bovis group during the period 1988-2011. we selected those cases associated with cholangitis and cholecystitis, defined according to tokyo guidelines. identification of the strains was performed using the api 20 strep and the gp card of the vitek 2 system, and was confirmed by molecular methods. our series included 51 cases (30 cholangitis and  21 cholecystitis). the associated microorganisms were: streptococcus infantarius  (biotype ii/1) 29 cases (57%), streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (biotype ii/2) 20 cases (39%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus  (biotype i) two cases (4%). the only difference found between s. infantarius and  s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus was a greater association of the first with malignant strictures of the bile ducts: 48% (14/29) versus 5% (1/20), p <0.001. thirty-seven of the cases also had bacteraemia, causing 20% (37/185) of all s. bovis bacteraemia, with differences between s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (2/112; 2%) and the other two microorganisms: s. infantarius and s. gallolyticus  subsp. pasteurianus (35/73; 48%; p <0.001). the vast majority of biliary tract infections due to s. bovis group are caused by s. infantarius and s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (s. bovis biotype ii), and nearly half of the bacteraemia due to these two species has a biliary source (43% of the s. infantarius and 56% of s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus).

TI  == competence for natural genetic transformation in the streptococcus bovis group streptococci s. infantarius and s. macedonicus.
AB  == natural genetic transformation is common among many species of the genus streptococcus, but it has never, or rarely, been reported for the streptococcus pyogenes and s. bovis groups of species, even though many streptococcal competence genes and the competence regulators sigx, comr, and coms are well conserved in both groups. to explore the incidence of competence in the s. bovis  group, 25 isolates of s. infantarius and s. macedonicus were surveyed by employing culture in chemically defined media devoid of peptide nutrients and treatment with synthetic candidate pheromone peptides predicted from the sequence of the gene coms. approximately half of strains examined were transformable, many transforming at high rates comparable to those for the well-characterized streptococcal natural transformation systems. in s. infantarius, nanomolar amounts of the synthetic pheromone ltawwgl induced robust but transient competence in high-density cultures, but mutation of the comrs locus abolished transformation. we conclude that at least these two species of the s. bovis group retain a robust system of natural transformation regulated by a comrs pheromone circuit and the alternative sigma factor sigx and infer that transformation is even more common among the streptococci than has been recognized. the tools presented here will facilitate targeted genetic manipulation in this group of streptococci.

TI  == comparative genome analysis of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius cj18, an african fermented camel milk isolate with adaptations to dairy environment.
AB  == background: streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius (sii) belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex associated with several human and animal infections. sii is a predominant bacterium in spontaneously fermented  milk products in africa. the genome sequence of sii strain cj18 was compared with that of other streptococcus species to identify dairy adaptations including genome decay such as in streptococcus thermophilus, traits for its competitiveness in spontaneous milk fermentation and to assess potential health risks for consumers. results: the genome of sii cj18 harbors several unique regions in comparison to sii atcc baa-102t, among others an enlarged exo- and capsular polysaccharide operon; streptococcus thermophilus-associated genes; a region containing metabolic and hypothetical genes mostly unique to cj18 and the  dairy isolate streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus; and a second oligopeptide transport operon. dairy adaptations in cj18 are reflected by a high  percentage of pseudogenes (4.9%) representing genome decay which includes the inactivation of the lactose phosphotransferase system (laciiabc) by multiple transposases integration. the presence of lacs and lacz genes is the major dairy  adaptation affecting lactose metabolism pathways also due to the disruption of laciiabc.we constructed mutant strains of lacs, lacz and laciiabc and analyzed the resulting strains of cj18 to confirm the redirection of lactose metabolism via lacs and lacz.natural competence genes are conserved in both sii strains, but cj18 contains a lower number of crispr spacers which indicates a reduced defense  capability against alien dna. no classical streptococcal virulence factors were detected in both sii strains apart from those involved in adhesion which should be considered niche factors. sii-specific virulence factors are not described. several sii-specific regions encoding uncharacterized proteins provide new leads  for virulence analyses and investigation of the unclear association of dairy and  clinical sii with human diseases. conclusions: the genome of the african dairy isolate sii cj18 clearly differs from the human isolate atcc baa-102t. cj18 possesses a high natural competence predisposition likely explaining the enlarged genome. metabolic adaptations to the dairy environment are evident and especially lactose uptake corresponds to s. thermophilus. genome decay is not as advanced as in s. thermophilus (10-19%) possibly due to a shorter history in dairy fermentations.

TI  == [streptococcus bovis, taxonomic status, clinical relevance and antimicrobial susceptibility].
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a large bacterial complex of facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci that includes distinct, genetically-related species. traditionally, s. bovis was classified into three biotypes: i (mannitol fermentation-positive), ii/1 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-negative), and ii/2 (mannitol-negative and beta-glucuronidase-positive). the introduction of molecular techniques in the last few decades has led to proposals for a genetic classification of this complex: s. bovis biotype i belongs to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, s. bovis biotype ii/1 is, in fact, streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, designated as streptococcus lutetiensis, and s. bovis biotype ii/2 is streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, commonly designated as streptococcus pasteurianus. although this modern taxonomy is currently accepted, many clinicians remain unfamiliar with these terms. the importance of correct identification lies in the strong association between bacteriemia, endocarditis and/or colon cancer and the various subspecies. in general, s. bovis is more susceptible to antimicrobial agents than other streptococci, but high levels of resistance to macrolides and tetracycline  have been described.

TI  == the relationship between the new taxonomy of streptococcus bovis and its clonality to colon cancer, endocarditis, and biliary disease.
AB  == background: the nomenclature of streptococcus bovis has changed. the study aims were to examine and compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of infections based on the new taxonomy and the genetic relatedness of strains. methods: bacteremic cases from 2004 to 2010 at assaf harofeh medical center were  reviewed. vitek 2 later confirmed with polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) was used for subspecies identification. vitek 2 later confirmed with etests was used for minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) testing. repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr) was used to determine the genetic relatedness of strains. results: twenty-four bacteremia cases were included. the median age of patients was 81 years (range 1 day to 91 years), two were neonates, three were pregnant, and 18 were elderly (>/= 65 years of age). the charlson's combined conditional age-related score was 8.2 +/- 2.9, and 11 (58 %) patients were immunosuppressed.  there were 13 patients who had s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, six had s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, four had s. infantarius subsp. coli, and one had s. infantarius subsp. infantarius. ten of 19 non-pregnant adult patients had  colon adenoma or carcinoma, three had acute biliary disease, and five had endocarditis. two patients died in the hospital. rep-pcr revealed polyclonality.  there were no significant associations between subspecies or genotypes and the various clinical characteristics or outcomes. conclusion: s. bovis bacteremia is  a serious disease that affects elderly immunosuppressed individuals. infection is strongly associated with colon pathology and endocarditis, regardless of the new  taxonomy or clone complex. the identification of s. bovis is of paramount importance, and microbiology laboratories should differentiate its processing from that of other s. viridans.

TI  == molecular characterization of a novel mosaic tet(s/m) gene encoding tetracycline  resistance in foodborne strains of streptococcus bovis.
AB  == the presence of antibiotic-resistance (ar) genes in foodborne bacteria of enteric origin represents a relevant threat to human health in the case of opportunistic  pathogens, which can reach the human gut through the food chain. streptococcus bovis is a human opportunistic pathogen often associated with infections in immune-compromised or cancer patients, and it can also be detected in the environment, including fermented foods. we have focused on the molecular characterization of a tetracycline (tet)-resistance gene present in 39 foodborne  isolates of s. bovis phenotypically resistant to this drug. the gene was identified as a novel tet(s/m) fusion, encoding a mosaic protein composed of the  n-terminal 33 amino acids of tet(s), in-frame with the tet(m) coding sequence. heterologous expression of the mosaic gene was found to confer tet resistance upon escherichia coli recipients. moreover, the tet(s/m) gene was found to be transcriptionally inducible by tet under the endogenous tet(s) promoter in both s. bovis and e. coli. nucleotide sequencing of the surrounding genomic region of  16.2 kb revealed large blocks of homology with the genomes of streptococcus infantarius and lactococcus lactis. a subregion of about 4 kb containing mosaic tet(s/m) was flanked by two copies of the is1216 mobile element. pcr amplification with primers directed outwards from the tet(s/m) gene identified the presence of a 4.3 kb circular form corresponding to the intervening chromosomal region between the two is1216 elements, but lacking a replication origin. the circular element shared extensive overall homology with a region of the multidrug-resistance plasmid pk214 from lc. lactis, containing tet(s), as well as the is1216 transposase-containing element and intervening non-coding sequences. linear reconstruction of the insertion events likely to have occurred  within this genomic region, inferred from sequence homology, provides further evidence of the chromosomal rearrangements that drive genomic evolution in complex bacterial communities such as the gut and food microbiota.

TI  == novel streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius variants harboring lactose metabolism genes homologous to streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) commonly associated with human and animal infections. we elucidated the lactose metabolism of s. infantarius subsp.  infantarius predominant in african fermented milk products. s. infantarius subsp. infantarius isolates (n = 192) were identified in 88% of spontaneously fermented  camel milk suusac samples (n = 24) from kenya and somalia at log(1)(0) 8.2-8.5 cfu ml(-)(1). african s. infantarius isolates excreted stoichiometric amounts of  galactose when grown on lactose, exhibiting a metabolism similar to streptococcus thermophilus and distinct from their type strain. african s. infantarius subsp. infantarius cj18 harbors a regular gal operon with 99.7-100% sequence identity to s. infantarius subsp. infantarius atcc baa-102(t) and a gal-lac operon with 91.7-97.6% sequence identity to s. thermophilus, absent in all sequenced sbsec strains analyzed. the expression and functionality of lacz was demonstrated in a  beta-galactosidase assay. the gal-lac operon was identified in 100% of investigated s. infantarius isolates (n = 46) from suusac samples and confirmed in malian fermented cow milk isolates. the african s. infantarius variant potentially evolved through horizontal gene transfer of an s. thermophilus-homologous lactose pathway. safety assessments are needed to identify any putative health risks of this novel s. infantarius variant.

TI  == a novel multiplex pcr/rflp assay for the identification of streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex members from dairy microbial communities based on the 16s rrna gene.
AB  == the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec) comprises pathogenic species associated with different degrees with human infections but also spontaneously fermented dairy products. we aimed therefore at developing a specific identification assay for the sbsec targeting the 16s rrna gene comprising a multiplex pcr followed by a differentiating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflp). the multiplex pcr assay was positively applied on 200 sbsec isolates including reference strains. the assay did not yield false-positive amplifications with strains of closely related bacteria and isolates of non-sbsec streptococci, lactococci, enterococci, and other genera of  dairy origin. the downstream rflp using msei and xbai enabled further discrimination of streptococcus infantarius/s. bovis (biotype ii.1) from streptococcus gallolyticus (biotype i and ii.2)/streptococcus alactolyticus and s. equinus. furthermore, the newly developed primers can be used directly for sanger sequencing. conclusively, this novel pcr/rflp assay is applicable in the complex dairy microbial communities and provides an important tool to assess the  prevalence of members of the sbsec in dairy products.

TI  == reidentification of streptococcus bovis isolates causing bacteremia according to  the new taxonomy criteria: still an issue?
AB  == all streptococcus bovis blood culture isolates recovered from january 2003 to january 2010 (n = 52) at the hospital universitario ramon y cajal were reidentified on the basis of their genetic traits using new taxonomic criteria. initial identification was performed by the semiautomatic wider system (fco. soria-melguizo, spain) and the api 20 strep system (biomerieux, france). all isolates were reidentified by pcr amplification and sequencing of both the 16s rrna and soda genes and by mass spectrometry using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms; bruker, germany). results of 16s rrna/soda gene sequencing were as follows: streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, 14/14 (number of isolates identified by 16s rrna/number of isolates identified by soda gene sequencing); streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, 24/24; streptococcus spp., 7/0; streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, 0/2; streptococcus lutetiensis, 0/5; leuconostoc  mesenteroides, 4/0; and lactococcus lactis, 3/3. maldi-tof ms identified 27 s. gallolyticus isolates but not at the subspecies level, 4 l. mesenteroides isolates, 3 l. lactis isolates, and 6 s. lutetiensis isolates, whereas 12 isolates rendered a nonreliable identification result. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis grouped all s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates into 3 major clusters clearly different from those of the s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus isolates, which, in turn, exhibited no clonal relationship. the percentages of resistance to the tested antimicrobials were 38% for erythromycin, 23% for fosfomycin, 10% for levofloxacin, 6% for tetracycline, and 4% for co-trimoxazole. the most frequent underlying diseases were hepatobiliary disorders (53%), endocarditis (17%), and malignancies (12%). we conclude that sequencing of the soda gene was the most discriminatory method and that s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus appears to have a higher genetic diversity than  s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus.

TI  == a case of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infective endocarditis with colon cancer: identification by 16s ribosomal dna sequencing.
AB  == although the association between streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colon carcinoma is well known, very few cases of s. bovis infection associated with underlying malignancies have been reported in korea. the s. bovis group has been  recently reclassified and renamed as streptococcus gallolyticus and streptococcus infantarius subspecies under a new nomenclature system. we report a case of infective endocarditis with colon cancer caused by s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously named s. bovis biotype i). a 59-yr-old woman presented with a 1-month history of fever. initial blood cultures were positive for gram-positive cocci, and echocardiography showed vegetation on mitral and aortic  valves. antibiotic treatment for infective endocarditis was started. the infecting strain was a catalase-negative and bile-esculin-positive alpha-hemolytic streptococcus susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin. the strain was identified as s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus with the use of the  vitek 2 gpi and api 20 strep systems (biomerieux, usa). the 16s rdna sequences of the blood culture isolates showed 100% homology with those of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus reported in genbank. the identification of the infecting organism, and the subsequent communication among clinical microbiologists and physicians about the changed nomenclature, led to the detection of colon cancer.  the patient recovered after treatment with antibiotics, valve surgery, and operation for colon cancer. this is the first report of biochemical and genetic identification of s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus causing infective endocarditis associated with underlying colon cancer in a korean patient.

AB  == members of the streptococcus bovis group are frequent colonizers of the intestinal tract, which can also cause endocarditis. however, their ability to adhere to and colonize host tissues and the factors associated with pathogenicity are largely unknown. here, we assessed 17 endocarditis-derived human isolates [identified here as 15 streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus (s. bovis biotype i), one s. gallolyticus ssp. pasteurianus (biotype ii/2) and one streptococcus infantarius ssp. coli (biotype ii/1)] for their in vitro adherence  to components of the extracellular matrix (ecm). adherence to collagen type i was found to be the most common phenotype exhibited by 76% of isolates, followed by collagen type iv (53%), fibrinogen (47%), collagen type v (35%) and fibronectin (35%). pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses showed that >50% of endocarditis-derived s. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus isolates are genetically diverse, although two clusters of two and four isolates were observed. the diversity of strains and differences observed in adherence characteristics to distinct host ecm proteins suggest that isolates of s. gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus produce different surface components, similar to other gram-positive pathogens, to colonize the host and cause infection.

TI  == a traditional sudanese fermented camel's milk product, gariss, as a habitat of streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius.
AB  == samples of the traditional sudanese fermented camel's milk product gariss representing 9 different regions in sudan were microbiologically characterized using an integrated approach including phenotypic and genotypic methods. lactic acid bacteria [log(cfu/g)=7.76-8.66] and yeasts [log(cfu/g)=6.05-7.79] were detected in high numbers. a total of 180 lab isolates were identified of which 123 isolates were found to belong to the streptococcus bovis group. thirteen representative isolates were characterized by pcr amplification and sequencing of the housekeeping genes rpob and soda and the streptococcal glucosyltransferase gene (gtf). all thirteen isolates were identified as streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, a potential human pathogen. the gene encoding the virulence determinant gtf was detected in 10 of the 13 tested strains. the same isolates were able to survive exposure to 0.3% (w/v) oxgall for 4 h and ph=2.7 for 1-4 h.  also lactobacillus fermentum were detected in high numbers, whereas enterococcus  faecium and lactobacillus helveticus were detected more occasionally. the yeast microflora in all gariss samples consisted of kluyveromyces marxianus and issatchenkia orientalis with the former being predominant in 7 out of 9 samples.

TI  == comprehensive study of strains previously designated streptococcus bovis consecutively isolated from human blood cultures and emended description of streptococcus gallolyticus and streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli.
AB  == modern taxonomy has delineated streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli, and s. infantarius subsp. infantarius within the heterogenous group of previously designated clinical streptococcus bovis bacteria. in the present study, 58 consecutive blood culture isolates initially designated s. bovis were further characterized by applying phenotypic and molecular genetic methods, and possible  disease associations were investigated by studying the patients' records. published phenotypic characteristics of s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius were not unequivocal and did not allow an unambiguous phenotypic differentiation of the 58 clinical isolates. however, full-length 16s rrna gene sequences clearly assigned the strains to s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (n = 29), s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (n = 12), and s. infantarius subsp. coli (n = 17). only 28% of the patients with available records presented with endocarditis  and 7% presented with colon carcinoma, whereas 37% of the patients had altered liver parenchyma and 28% had gall bladder disease as underlying diseases. detailed antimicrobial susceptibility data on both s. gallolyticus subspecies and s. infantarius subsp. coli are given for the first time. as a result of the extensive characterization of the largest number of s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius human clinical isolates published so far, emended species descriptions are given. it is recommended that both clinical microbiologists and  infectious disease specialists avoid the designation s. bovis for true s. gallolyticus and s. infantarius strains in the future in order to get a clearer picture of the possible disease associations of these species.

TI  == geno- and phenotypic diversity of avian isolates of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (streptococcus bovis) and associated diagnostic problems.
AB  == recently, strains of streptococcus bovis were reclassified as streptococcus gallolyticus. in the present study we describe for the first time an outbreak of  s. gallolyticus in a broiler flock. mortality during the first week was normal (<1%), with a final total mortality at the end of production reaching 4.3%. specific symptoms were not observed. postmortem pathology demonstrated enlarged and light spleens and livers accompanied by multifocal irregular necroses surrounded by a hemorrhagic zone. in addition, these birds suffered from arthritis and osteomyelitis. strains isolated from liver and spleen lesions showed clonality as demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. compared to strains representing previously derived phylogeny, including the s. bovis-s. equinus complex, the 16s rrna-derived phylogeny of the strains investigated in this study demonstrated a paraphyletic group (s. gallolyticus) well separated from two monophyletic groups: (i) s. equinus-s. bovis plus s. infantarius and (ii) s. alactolyticus plus s. intestinalis. according to information in genbank,  none of the strains included from the two monophyletic groups have been isolated  from birds. further biochemical analyses, including tannase activity, identified  for the first time avian isolates belonging to s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. however, these investigations also demonstrated a clear heterogeneity with pigeon isolates.

TI  == changes in equine hindgut bacterial populations during oligofructose-induced laminitis.
AB  == in the horse, carbohydrate overload is thought to play an integral role in the onset of laminitis by drastically altering the profile of bacterial populations in the hindgut. the objectives of this study were to develop and validate microbial ecology methods to monitor changes in bacterial populations throughout  the course of experimentally induced laminitis and to identify the predominant oligofructose-utilizing organisms. laminitis was induced in five horses by administration of oligofructose. faecal specimens were collected at 8 h intervals from 72 h before to 72 h after the administration of oligofructose. hindgut microbiota able to utilize oligofructose were enumerated throughout the course of the experiment using habitat-simulating medium. isolates were collected and representatives identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the majority of these isolates collected belonged to the genus streptococcus, 91% of which were identified as being most closely related to streptococcus infantarius ssp. coli.  furthermore, s. infantarius ssp. coli was the predominant oligofructose-utilizing organism isolated before the onset of lameness. fluorescence in situ hybridization probes developed to specifically target the isolated streptococcus  spp. demonstrated marked population increases between 8 and 16 h post oligofructose administration. this was followed by a rapid population decline which corresponded with a sharp decline in faecal ph and subsequently lameness at 24-32 h post oligofructose administration. this research suggests that streptococci within the streptococcus bovis/equinus complex may be involved in the series of events which precede the onset of laminitis in the horse.

TI  == new group d streptococcal species.
AB  == background & objectives: the heterogeneity of group d streptococci led to the identification of various biotypes of streptococcus equinus and streptococcus bovis and to the description of new species. the objective of the present study was to improve the phenotypic delineation between species and to clarify their respective phylogenetic position. methods: physiological and genomic analyses were carried out in 84 representative strains of the group d streptococci. biotypes were determined with the api 20 strep and rapid id 32 strep systems of identification. quantitative dna-dna hybridization under stringent conditions and values of the deltat(m) allowed to delineate species and subspecies. the phylogenic position of the different genomic groups was determined by comparing the sequences of their 16s rdna. results: four dna-clusters, including seven species or subspecies, were characterized. differential associations of biochemical characters allowed their identification. s. equinus and the type strain of s. bovis belonged to a single species. s. gallolyticus, s. bovis biotype ii.2, and s. macedonicus formed a single dna-cluster including three different subspecies. these were designated as s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, and s. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus. the two other dna-clusters corresponded to the two subspecies of s.  infantarius, and to s. alactolyticus. interpretation & conclusion: this study presented a new classification associated with an identification scheme of group  d streptococci. the changes in this classification demonstrate the interest of a  polyphagic approach of the bacterial identification.

TI  == carcinogenic properties of proteins with pro-inflammatory activity from streptococcus infantarius (formerly s.bovis).
AB  == several studies reported linkage between bacterial infections and carcinogenesis. streptococcus bovis was traditionally considered as a lower grade pathogen frequently involved in bacteremia and endocarditis. this bacterium became important in human health as it was shown that 25-80% of patients who presented a s.bovis bacteremia had also a colorectal tumor. moreover, in previous experiments, we demonstrated that s.bovis or s.bovis wall extracted antigens (wea) were able to promote carcinogenesis in rats. the aim of the present study was: (i) to identify the s.bovis proteins responsible for in vitro pro-inflammatory properties; (ii) to purify them; (iii) to examine their ability  to stimulate in vitro il-8 and cox-2 expression by human colon cancer cells; and  (iv) to assess in vivo their pro-carcinogenic potential in a rat model of colon carcinogenesis. the purified s300 fraction, as determined by proteomic analysis,  contained 72 protein spots in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis representing 12 different proteins able to trigger human epithelial colonic caco-2 cells and rat  colonic mucosa to release cxc chemokines (human il-8 or rat cinc/gro) and prostaglandins e2, correlated with an in vitro over-expression of cox-2. moreover, these proteins were highly effective in the promotion of pre-neoplastic lesions in azoxymethane-treated rats. in the presence of these proteins, caco-2 cells exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of the three classes of map kinases. our results show a relationship between the pro-inflammatory potential of s.bovis proteins and their pro-carcinogenic properties, confirming the linkage between inflammation and colon carcinogenesis. these data support the hypothesis that colonic bacteria can contribute to cancer development particularly in chronic infection/inflammation diseases where bacterial components may interfere with cell function.

TI  == reappraisal of the taxonomy of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex and related species: description of streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus subsp. nov., s. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus subsp. nov. and s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus subsp. nov.
AB  == 'streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus' is a large bacterial complex including different species frequently isolated from infections of humans (streptococcus gallolyticus, streptococcus infantarius) or animals (s. bovis, s.  equinus, streptococcus alactolyticus). the separation of s. bovis into three different biotypes has been partially correlated with genetic differentiation. in addition, recent advances in bacterial phylogeny have led to the inclusion of streptococcus macedonicus and streptococcus waius in this complex. the aim of this study was to improve physiological differentiation between species related to the complex and to clarify their respective phylogenetic positions. in this study, physiological, genetic and phylogenetic analyses of a set of 88 streptococcal strains were performed. the diversity of strains of s. bovis biotype ii was analysed, and it was confirmed that they belong to different species, either s. equinus or s. infantarius. it was demonstrated that s. gallolyticus, s. bovis biotype ii.2, s. macedonicus and s. waius form a single dna cluster separated into three different subspecies. they are delineated by different biochemical traits, limited dna-dna relatedness and noticeable divergence in 16s rdna sequences. according to the current definition of species, the names s. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus subsp. nov., s. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus subsp. nov. and s. gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus subsp. nov. are proposed for these three subspecies.

TI  == taxonomic dissection of the streptococcus bovis group by analysis of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (soda) sequences: reclassification  of 'streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli' as streptococcus lutetiensis sp. nov.  and of streptococcus bovis biotype 11.2 as streptococcus pasteurianus sp. nov.
AB  == the taxonomic dissection of the streptococcus bovis-streptococcus equinus group was carried out upon obtaining sequences for the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase gene (soda) of the type strains of s. bovis, streptococcus caprinus, s. equinus, streptococcus gallolyticus, streptococcus infantarius, streptococcus macedonicus and streptococcus waius. the soda sequences of 29 streptococcal strains of animal and human origin that were related to s. bovis were also sequenced. a phylogenetic analysis of the soda sequences revealed that the s. bovis-s. equinus group comprises five different clusters that correspond to five  distinct species. the type strains of s. bovis and s. equinus were associated in  the same cluster, corresponding to the species s. equinus. the type strains of s. caprinus, s. gallolyticus, s. macedonicus and s. waius were associated in the same cluster, which defined a single species containing s. gallolyticus and its junior synonym s. caprinus, and s. macedonicus and its junior synonym s. waius. the two subspecies thought to constitute the species s. infantarius, namely s. infantarius subsp. infantarius and 's. infantarius subsp. coli', were located in  two distinct clusters. one of these clusters defined the species s. infantarius and included the type strain of s. infantarius subsp. infantarius. the other cluster defined 's. infantarius subsp. coli', leading to the proposal of its reclassification as the novel species streptococcus lutetiensis (nem 782t = cip 106849t). the remaining cluster comprised all of the strains previously identified as belonging to s. bovis biotype 11.2, leading to the proposal to reassign these strains to the novel species streptococcus pasteurianus (nem 1202t = cip 107122t). the results of the phylogenetic analysis were confirmed by dna-dna hybridization experiments, thus demonstrating that sequence databases of  defined dna targets, such as soda, may constitute a valuable alternative approach for modern bacterial systematics.

TI  == 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis distinguishes biotypes of streptococcus bovis: streptococcus bovis biotype ii/2 is a separate genospecies and the predominant clinical isolate in adult males.
AB  == we characterized 22 human clinical strains of streptococcus bovis by genotypic (16s rrna gene sequence analysis [microseq]; applied biosystems, foster city, calif.) and phenotypic (api 20 strep and rapid id32 strep systems (biomerieux vitek, hazelton, mo.) methods. the strains, isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (csf), and urine, formed two distinct 16s ribosomal dna sequence clusters.  three strains which were associated with endocarditis urinary tract infection (uti), and sepsis clustered with the s. bovis type strain atcc 33317 (cluster 1); other closely related type strains were s. equinus and s. infantarius. nineteen strains clustered at a distance of about 2.5% dissimilarity to the s. bovis type  strain (cluster 2) and were associated with central nervous system (cns) disease  in addition to endocarditis, uti, and sepsis. all strains were distinct from s. gallolyticus. within cluster 2, a single strain grouped with atcc strain 43143 (cluster 2a) and may be phenotypically distinct. all the other strains formed a second subgroup (cluster 2b) that was biochemically similar to s. bovis biotype ii/2 (mannitol negative and beta galactosidase, alpha galactosidase, beta glucuronidase, and trehalose positive). the api 20 strep system identified isolates of cluster 2b as s. bovis biotype ii/2, those of cluster 1 as s. bovis biotype ii/1, and that of cluster 2a as s. bovis biotype i. there was an excellent correlation of biotype and genotype: s. bovis biotype ii/2 isolates form a separate genospecies distinct from the s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, and s. infantarius type strains and are the most common isolates in adult males.

TI  == streptococcus infantarius sp. nov., streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius  subsp. nov. and streptococcus infantarius subsp. coli subsp. nov., isolated from  humans and food.
AB  == eighteen strains isolated from human specimens or from food products were characterized as atypical variants of mannitol-negative streptococcus bovis. they were tested for extended biochemical criteria, ribotyping and dna-dna hybridization in order to define their taxonomic status. these strains were demonstrated to constitute a dna relatedness group that includes strains of dna group 4 of farrow et al. (1984). comparative analysis of 16s rrna sequences demonstrated that these strains represent a new species which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex and which has been provisionally named s. infantarius by bouvet et al. (1997). biotyping and ribotyping allowed differentiation of these strains from the aesculin-positive strains of s. bovis belonging to the previously described biotypes i, ii.1 and ii.2. the results of the ribotyping and hybridization assays demonstrated the presence of two different dna subgroups within the 18 strains. on the basis of these data, the names s. infantarius subsp. infantarius (aesculin-negative for five strains out of seven, including the type strain hdp 90056t = ncdo 599t) and  s. infantarius subsp. coli (aesculin-positive, reference strain hdp 90248 = ncdo  2620) are proposed as the names for these two subspecies within the s. infantarius species.
