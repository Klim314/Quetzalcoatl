TI  == microbial profile of root canals of primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to assess the microbial content of root canals of human primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion. methods: microbial samples were collected from 24 canals of children treated at a pediatric dentistry clinic. microbiological identification was performed using checker-board dna-dna hybridization for 40 different bacteria. data were analyzed per canal based on the mean count and frequency of each bacterial species. results: detectable levels of bacterial species were observed for 35 probes (88%). the most frequent bacteria were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia. facultative species were identified in 20 root canals  (83%), anaerobic species were identified in 24 root canals (100%), and aerobic species in 18 root canals (75%). black-pigmented bacilli were found in 23 samples (96%). the number of different bacterial species detected per canal ranged from five to 33. conclusion: endodontic infection in primary teeth with pulp necrosis  and periradicular lesion is multimicrobial, including aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic micro-organisms.

TI  == prevotella jejuni sp. nov., isolated from the small intestine of a child with coeliac disease.
AB  == five obligately anaerobic, gram-stain-negative, saccharolytic and proteolytic, non-spore-forming bacilli (strains cd3 : 27, cd3 : 28(t), cd3 : 33, cd3 : 32 and  cd3 : 34) are described. all five strains were isolated from the small intestine  of a female child with coeliac disease. cells of the five strains were short rods or coccoid cells with longer filamentous forms seen sporadically. the organisms produced acetic acid and succinic acid as major metabolic end products. phylogenetic analysis based on comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed close relationships between cd3 : 27, cd3 : 28(t) and cd3 : 33, between  cd3 : 32 and prevotella histicola ccug 55407(t), and between cd3 : 34 and prevotella melaninogenica ccug 4944b(t). strains cd3 : 27, cd3 : 28(t) and cd3 :  33 were clearly different from all recognized species within the genus prevotella and related most closely to but distinct from p. melaninogenica. based on 16s rrna, rna polymerase beta-subunit (rpob) and 60 kda chaperonin protein subunit (cpn60) gene sequencing, and phenotypic, chemical and biochemical properties, strains cd3 : 27, cd3 : 28(t) and cd3 : 33 are considered to represent a novel species within the genus prevotella, for which the name prevotella jejuni sp. nov. is proposed. strain cd3 : 28(t) ( = ccug 60371(t) = dsm 26989(t)) is the type strain of the proposed novel species. all five strains were able to form homologous aggregates, in which tube-like structures were connecting individual bacteria cells. the five strains were able to bind to human intestinal carcinoma  cell lines at 37 degrees c.

TI  == description of alloprevotella rava gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity, and reclassification of prevotella tannerae moore et al. 1994 as alloprevotella tannerae gen. nov., comb. nov.
AB  == five strains of anaerobic, gram-negative bacilli isolated from the human oral cavity were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests  and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. phylogenetic analysis of full-length 16s rrna gene sequences showed that these strains represented a novel group within the family prevotellaceae, and the most closely related species was  prevotella tannerae. p. tannerae and the novel taxon are deeply branched from the genus prevotella, with sequence identities to the type strain of the type species of prevotella, prevotella melaninogenica, of 82.2 and 85.6 %, respectively. the novel genus alloprevotella gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate the novel species alloprevotella rava gen. nov., sp. nov. and the previously named prevotella tannerae moore et al. 1994 as alloprevotella tannerae gen. nov., comb. nov. the type species is alloprevotella tannerae. the type strain of alloprevotella rava is 81/4-12(t) ( = dsm 22548(t) = ccug 58091(t)) and the type strain of alloprevotella tannerae is atcc 51259(t) = ccug 34292(t) = cip 104476(t) = nctc 13073(t). alloprevotella rava is weakly to moderately saccharolytic and produces  moderate amounts of acetic acid and major amounts of succinic acid as end products of fermentation. strains are sensitive to 20 % bile and hydrolyse gelatin. the principal cellular long-chain fatty acids are anteiso-c15 : 0, iso-c15 : 0, c16 : 0, iso-c17 : 0 and iso-c17 : 0 3-oh. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain is 47 mol%.

TI  == the short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: this study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum  of the tongue. material and methods: a randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects  was performed. bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: no halitosis (identified by vsc assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone,  in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. at day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas gingivalis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and tannerella forsythia. a decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: p. gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, s. aureus, and treponema denticola. baseline vsc scores were correlated with several bacterial species. the use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of vsc compared to rinsing alone. conclusions: vsc scores were  not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. the active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. clinical relevance: periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.

TI  == prevotella fusca sp. nov. and prevotella scopos sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == two strains of anaerobic, gram-negative bacilli isolated from the human oral cavity were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests  and were found to belong to two separate taxa. phylogenetic analysis of full-length 16s rrna gene sequences showed that the strains were both related to, but distinct from, the type strain of prevotella melaninogenica. two novel species, prevotella fusca sp. nov. and prevotella scopos sp. nov., are proposed to accommodate these strains. both strains were saccharolytic and produced acetic and succinic acids, with lesser amounts of lactic and isovaleric acids, as end products of fermentation, and both were sensitive to 20 % bile. the principal cellular long-chain fatty acids of both strains were ai-c(15 : 0), 3-oh i-c(17 :  0), 3-oh c(16 : 0), i-c(15 : 0) and c(16 : 0). the dna g+c contents of the type strains of prevotella fusca (w1435(t) = dsm 22504(t) = ccug 57946(t)) and prevotella scopos (w2052(t) = dsm 22613(t ) = ccug 57945(t)) were 43 and 41 mol%, respectively. the two species could be differentiated by gelatin hydrolysis, cellobiose and ribose fermentation, and production of beta-glucosidase.

TI  == prevotella histicola sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == three strains of anaerobic, variably pigmenting, gram-negative bacilli isolated from human oral mucosal tissue were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous group. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and dna-dna hybridization revealed that the strains constituted a novel group within the genus prevotella, being most closely related to prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella veroralis. a novel species, prevotella histicola sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. prevotella histicola is saccharolytic and produces acetic acid and succinic acid  as major end products of fermentation and trace to minor amounts of isovaleric acid and lactic acid. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain is 43 mol%. the type strain of prevotella histicola is t05-04t (=dsm 19854t=ccug 55407t).

TI  == prevotella paludivivens sp. nov., a novel strictly anaerobic, gram-negative, hemicellulose-decomposing bacterium isolated from plant residue and rice roots in irrigated rice-field soil.
AB  == two strictly anaerobic bacterial strains, kb7(t) and a42, were isolated from rice plant residue and living rice roots, respectively, from irrigated rice-field soil in japan. these two strains were closely related to each other with 16s rrna gene sequence similarity of 99.8 %. both strains showed almost the same physiological  properties. cells were gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming rods. growth  was remarkably stimulated by the addition of haemin to the medium. the strains utilized various saccharides including xylan, xylose, pectin and carboxymethylcellulose and produced acetate and succinate with small amounts of formate and malate. the strains grew at 10-40 degrees c; optimum growth was observed at 30 degrees c and ph 5.7-6.7. oxidase, catalase and nitrate-reducing activities were not detected. aesculin was hydrolysed. the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c(15 : 0), iso-c(15 : 0), c(15 : 0) and iso-c(17 : 0) 3-oh. menaquinones mk-11 and mk-11(h(2)) were the major respiratory quinones and the genomic dna g+c content was 39.2 mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences placed both strains in the phylum bacteroidetes. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that the most related species to both strains was prevotella oulorum (92.8-92.9 % similarity). prevotella veroralis and prevotella  melaninogenica were the next most closely related known species with sequence similarities of 91.9-92.4 %. based on differences in the phylogenetic, ecological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics between the two isolates and related species, it is proposed that strains kb7(t) and a42 represent a novel species, prevotella paludivivens sp. nov. this is the first described prevotella species derived from a natural habitat; all other prevotella species are from mammalian sources. the type strain of prevotella paludivivens is kb7(t) (=jcm 13650(t)=dsm 17968(t)).

TI  == bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis.
AB  == background: aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. the aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)  gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. methods: universal eubacterial primers  were used to amplify 16s rrna bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. subsequently, pcr amplicons were cloned into escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity  or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in genbank. results: sequences of stenotrophomonas spp., including s. maltophilia (formerly pseudomonas homology group v) were detected in six aneurysm samples. propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and brevundimonas diminuta (formerly p. diminuta) in four samples. other species previously assigned to the pseudomonas genus such as comamonas testosteroni, delftia acidovorans, burkholderia cepacia, herbaspirillum sp., and acidovorax sp. were also detected. some clones fell into other environmental species, including methylobacterium sp. and bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria  that have not yet been cultivated. dna sequences from oral bacteria, including streptococcus sanguinis, tannerella forsythia, and leptotrichia buccalis were detected. sequences from prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. additional species included dermacoccus spp. and corynebacterium vitaeruminis. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development.  several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. clinical relevance: although chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. in the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. the presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at c.pneumoniae.

TI  == prevotella massiliensis sp. nov. isolated from human blood.
AB  == we report a bacterial isolate (marseille isolate) recovered from the blood of a patient hospitalized in an intensive care unit, presenting with severe trauma, fever and mechanical ventilation. colonies appeared at 37 degrees c on blood agar after 72 h incubation. this isolate was a strictly anaerobic, gram-negative rod phenotypically related to other prevotella species described to date: non-motile, catalase-negative, oxidase-positive, non-glucose fermenting, resistant to vancomycin and susceptible to kanamycin. cells exhibited a trilamellar membrane under electron microscopy. the fatty acid methyl ester profile was marginally related to that of clostridium botulinum group a (distance: 26.27%) and bifidobacterium bifidum gc subgroup b (distance: 26.38%). 16s rrna gene sequence  similarity was 90.0% with that of prevotella oris and 89.1% with that of prevotella melaninogenica. partial rpob gene sequence similarity was 84.5 and 86.4% with p. oris and p. melaninogenica, respectively. according to current standards, phenotypic traits, 16s rrna and rpob gene sequence analyses indicated  that the marseille isolate belonged to a previously unrecognized species of the genus prevotella, and we propose classifying it in the new taxon "prevotella massiliensis" sp. nov.

TI  == antibacterial activity and post-antibiotic effect of flurithromycin compared with other macrolides and penicillins against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == in this study the authors examined the activity of flurithromycin compared to that of erythromycin, spiramycin and penicillin against 107 strains of various species supposed to cause periodontitis. the range of mics of flurithromycin was: < or =0.06-2 mg/l for p. gingivalis (28 isolates), 0.06-2 mg/l for p. melaninogenica (7), 0.5-4 mg/l for p. intermedia (5), 0.25-8 mg/l for prevotella  sp. (8), 1-16 mg/l for f. nucleatum (14), 0.12-0.5 mg/l for w. recta (2), 0.5-32  mg/l for e. corrodens, 0.5-2 mg/l for b. forsythus (2); < or =0.06-64 mg/l for peptostreptococcus sp. (11), < or =0.06-1 mg/l for a. odontolyticus (11) and for  a. naeslundii (7) and < or =0.06-16 mg/l for a. viscosus (7). macrolide activity  was ranked in decreasing order from flurithromycin to erythromycin to spiramycin. beta-lactamase production was demonstrated in prevotella sp. (20%) and in f. nucleatum (7%). isolates which were beta-lactamase negative but resistant to penicillin were found among peptostreptococcus sp. and actinomyces sp. a post-antibiotic effect of 2 hours was seen for flurithromycin on p. gingivalis and e. corrodens. the good in vitro activity of flurithromycin against bacteria supposed to cause periodontitis suggests clinical potential in the treatment of these diseases.

TI  == features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with chediak-higashi syndrome.
AB  == background: chediak-higashi syndrome (c-hs) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. the complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. methods: a 14-year-old male c-hs patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of c-hs. results: laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. these granules and inclusions were characteristic of chediak-higashi syndrome. oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque  samples, including fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sp. biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear  leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. viable dividing bacteria were  found in the cytoplasm. conclusions: in this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of c-hs granulocyte deficiency. periodontal treatment  of these patients is often unsuccessful. this case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.

TI  == oropharynx microbiota among alcoholics and non-alcoholics.
AB  == context: the oropharynx microbiota plays an important role in the origin of infections, especially among alcoholics whose airway defenses are impaired. objective: to compare the normal oropharingeal flora in heavy alcohol drinker and non-alcoholics. patients: 117 persons, 58 heavy alcohol drinkers and 59 non-alcoholics. setting: santa casa de sao paulo emergency service. design: a blind prospective study. main outcomes measures: prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. results: the study of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy alcohol drinkers demonstrated the presence of anaerobic microorganisms in 84.5% of them, including: bacteroides sp, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium sp, veilonella sp, peptostreptococcus sp, propionibacterium sp, bifidobacterium sp and clostridium sp, versus 30.5% (p < 0.005) of non-alcoholics. candida sp was present in 34.5% of heavy alcohol drinkers and 5.1% of non-alcoholics (p < 0.005). enterobacteria predominated among heavy alcohol drinkers (25%) compared with non-alcoholics (5.5%) only in the age group 14 to 34 years (p < 0.05). conclusion: based upon these results, it was possible to conclude that the knowledge of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy drinkers and non-alcoholics has an important predictive value concerning probable etiologic agents of lower airway infections. infections caused by anaerobic microorganisms and fungi should be taken into consideration during the  choice of empirical therapy for heavy alcohol drinkers.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (rth), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (oth). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). the highest recovery rate of  organisms per tonsil was in patients with oth (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in rt and 5.9 per tonsil in rth. the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), neisseria sp (16), staphylococcus aureus (14), and eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were fusobacterium sp (8), bacteroides sp (7), and prevotella melaninogenica (5). the number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). a higher concentration of s aureus and h influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (rth and oth) as compared to rt. these findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for h influenzae and s aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and  without inflammation (rth and oth). further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == the bacteriology of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == plaque samples from 22 ulcerated sites in eight patients with anug were cultured  using quantitative anaerobic procedures and were examined microscopically. the partial characterization of the predominant cultivable flora revealed a constant  flora comprised of a limited number of bacterial types and a variable flora composed of a heterogeneous array of bacterial types. this constant flora would appear to be pathognomonic of acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (anug) and  included the various treponema and selenomonas sp., which comprised about 32 and  6%, respectively, of the microscopic count; b. melaninogenicus ssp. intermedius and fusobacterium sp., which averaged 24 and 3%, respectively, of the viable count. one week of metronidazole treatment caused a prompt resolution of clinical symptoms, which coincided with a significant reduction in the plaque proportions  of the treponema sp., b. melaninogenicus ssp., intermedius and fusobacterium sp.  for at least 2 to 3 months following treatment. thus, the same anaerobic species  which were numerically associated with the anug lesion were also selectively reduced in the plaque flora following resolution of the infection. this supports  a role for the above species in the ulcerative stage of the lesion but does not demonstrate that these specific anaerobes initiated the infection. although not confirmed by the data, it was proposed that these particular anaerobic species gained ascendency in the plaque as a result of being selected through the availability of host-derived nutrients in individuals who had undergone certain physiological and psychological stresses.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients.  anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only  organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.

AB  == strains of bacteroides asaccharolyticus and bacteroides melaninogenicus subspecies isolated from human and animal sources were examined for the production of phenylacetic acid. b. asaccharolyticus strains isolated from sites  in humans and monkeys always produced phenylacetic acid. b. asaccharolyticus strains isolated from human nonoral sites consistently failed to produce this product. this metabolic difference correlates with the genetic dichotomy recently found to exist between oral and nonoral b. asaccharolyticus strains.

TI  == [phlegmon of the fore arm succeeding to a dog-bite : respective role of the miscellaneous bacteria involved in this mixed infection (author's transl)].
AB  == the authors report a case of a severe mixed infection (phlegmon of the fore arm)  succeeding to a dog bite. a complex flora has been isolated from this phlegmom :  pasteurella multocida, pasteurella pneumotropica, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces sp., bacteroides melaninogenicus, and a gram- bacteria related to group ii j. the pathogeny of such diseases is discussed, dwelling in one hand on  the part of synergistic development of these various germs and in the other hand  on the part played by saliva in the severity of animal or human bites. this kind  of wound requires careful disinfection and radical debridment without omitting a  preventive broad-spectrum antibiotherapy.

TI  == anaerobic isolates in chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. treatment with  carbenicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  == tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. the aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). there were  46 aerobic isolates. the aerobes commonly recovered were pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) proteus sp. (5) and staphylococcus aureus (3). there were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and bacteroides sp., the latter of which included bacteroides fragilis group and bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). the patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. the clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. there were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. the above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic  and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.
