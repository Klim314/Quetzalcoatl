TI  == evaluation of broiler litter with reference to the microbial composition as assessed by using 16s rrna and functional gene markers.
AB  == very little is known about the microbial composition of animal bedding wastes, including poultry litter, and what is known has been deduced from standard culture methods, by which some fastidious organisms that exist in the environment may not be detected. we evaluated the bacterial composition of poultry litter by  using a combination of culture and molecular detection. total aerobic bacteria in poultry litter were detected by culture at 10(9) cfu/g of material. enteric bacteria such as enterococcus spp. and coliforms composed 0.1 and 0.01%, respectively, of the total aerobic cultivatable bacteria in poultry litter; no salmonella strains were detected by culture. in order to characterize the most abundant bacterial groups, we sequenced 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) genes amplified  by pcr with microbial community dna isolated from poultry litter as the template. from the 16s rdna library, 31 genera were identified. twelve families or groups were identified with lactobacilli and salinococcus spp. forming the most abundant groups. in fact, 82% of the total sequences were identified as gram-positive bacteria with 62% of total belonging to low g+c gram-positive groups. in addition to detection of 16s rdna sequences associated with the expected fecal bacteria present in manure, we detected many bacterial sequences for organisms, such as globicatella sulfidofaciens, corynebacterium ammoniagenes, corynebacterium urealyticum, clostridium aminovalericum, arthrobacter sp., and denitrobacter permanens, that may be involved in the degradation of wood and cycling of nitrogen and sulfur. several sequences were identified in the library for bacteria associated with disease in humans and poultry such as clostridia, staphylococci, and bordetella spp. however, specific pcr targeting other human and veterinary pathogens did not detect the presence of salmonella, pathogenic escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., yersinia spp., listeria spp., or toxigenic  staphylococci. pcr and dna hybridization revealed the presence of class 1 integrons with gene cassettes that specify resistance to aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol. only from understanding the microbial community of animal wastes such as poultry litter can we manage animal disease and limit the impact of animal waste on the environment and human and animal health.
