TI  == body fluid identification by integrated analysis of dna methylation and body fluid-specific microbial dna.
AB  == identification of body fluids found at crime scenes provides important information that can support a link between sample donors and actual criminal acts. previous studies have reported that dna methylation analysis at several tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tdmrs) enables successful identification of semen, and the detection of certain bacterial dna can allow for identification of saliva and vaginal fluid. in the present study, a method for detecting bacterial dna was integrated into a previously reported multiplex methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-polymerase chain reaction. the developed multiplex pcr was modified by the addition of a new semen-specific marker and by  including amplicons for the 16s ribosomal rna gene of saliva- and vaginal fluid-specific bacteria to improve the efficacy to detect a specific type of body fluid. using the developed multiplex system, semen was distinguishable by unmethylation at the usp49, dact1, and pfn3 tdmrs and by hypermethylation at l81528, and saliva could be identified by detection of saliva-specific bacteria,  veillonella atypica and/or streptococcus salivarius. additionally, vaginal fluid  and menstrual blood were differentiated from other body fluids by hypomethylation at the pfn3 tdmr and the presence of vaginal fluid-specific bacteria, lactobacillus crispatus and/or lactobacillus gasseri. because the developed multiplex system uses the same biological source of dna for individual identification profiling and simultaneously analyses various types of body fluid  in one pcr reaction, this method will facilitate more efficient body fluid identification in forensic casework.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
