TI  == molecular basis of [fefe]-hydrogenase function: an insight into the complex interplay between protein and catalytic cofactor.
AB  == the precise electrochemical features of metal cofactors that convey the functions of redox enzymes are essentially determined by the specific interaction pattern between cofactor and enclosing protein environment. however, while biophysical techniques allow a detailed understanding of the features characterizing the cofactor itself, knowledge about the contribution of the protein part is much harder to obtain. [fefe]-hydrogenases are an interesting class of enzymes that catalyze both, h2 oxidation and the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen with significant efficiency. the active site of these proteins consists of an unusual prosthetic group (h-cluster) with six iron and six sulfur atoms. while h-cluster architecture and catalytic states during the different steps of h2 turnover have been thoroughly investigated during the last 20 years, possible functional contributions from the polypeptide framework were only assumed according to the level of conservancy and x-ray structure analyses. due to the recent development of simpler and more efficient expression systems the role of single amino acids can now be experimentally investigated. this article summarizes, compares and categorizes the results of recent investigations based on site directed and random mutagenesis according to their informative value about structure function relationships in [fefe]-hydrogenases. this article is part of a special issue entitled: metals in bioenergetics and biomimetics systems.

TI  == inhibition of biocatalysis in [fe-fe] hydrogenase by oxygen: molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations.
AB  == designing o(2)-tolerant hydrogenases is a major challenge in applying [fe-fe]h(2)ases for h(2) production. the inhibition involves transport of oxygen  through the enzyme to the h-cluster, followed by binding and subsequent deactivation of the active site. to explore the nature of the oxygen diffusion channel for the hydrogenases from desulfovibrio desulfuricans (dd) and clostridium pasteurianum (cp), empirical molecular dynamics simulations were performed. the dynamic nature of the oxygen pathways in dd and cp was elucidated, and insight is provided, in part, into the experimental observation on the difference of oxygen inhibition in dd and the hydrogenase from clostridium acetobutylicum (ca, assumed homologous to cp). further, to gain an understanding  of the mechanism of oxygen inhibition of the [fe-fe]h(2)ase, density functional theory calculations of model compounds composed of the h-cluster and proximate amino acids are reported. confirmation of the experimentally based suppositions on inactivation by oxygen at the [2fe](h) domain is provided, validating the model compounds used and oxidation state assumptions, further explaining the mode of damage. this unified approach provides insight into oxygen diffusion in the enzyme, followed by deactivation at the h-cluster.

TI  == formaldehyde--a rapid and reversible inhibitor of hydrogen production by [fefe]-hydrogenases.
AB  == dihydrogen (h(2)) production by [fefe]-hydrogenases is strongly inhibited by formaldehyde (methanal) in a reaction that is rapid, reversible, and specific to  this type of hydrogenase. this discovery, using three [fefe]-hydrogenases that are homologous about the active site but otherwise structurally distinct, was made by protein film electrochemistry, which measures the activity (as electrical current) of enzymes immobilized on an electrode; importantly, the inhibitor can be removed after addition. formaldehyde causes rapid loss of proton reduction activity which is restored when the solution is exchanged. inhibition is confirmed by conventional solution assays. the effect depends strongly on the direction of catalysis: inhibition of h(2) oxidation is much weaker than for h(2) production, and formaldehyde also protects against co and o(2) inactivation. by contrast, inhibition of [nife]-hydrogenases is weak. the results strongly suggest that formaldehyde binds at, or close to, the active site of [fefe]-hydrogenases at a site unique to this class of enzyme--highly conserved lysine and cysteine residues, the bridgehead atom of the dithiolate ligand, or the reduced fe(d) that is the focal center of catalysis.

TI  == electrochemical kinetic investigations of the reactions of [fefe]-hydrogenases with carbon monoxide and oxygen: comparing the importance of gas tunnels and active-site electronic/redox effects.
AB  == a major obstacle for future biohydrogen production is the oxygen sensitivity of [fefe]-hydrogenases, the highly active catalysts produced by bacteria and green algae. the reactions of three representative [fefe]-hydrogenases with o(2) have been studied by protein film electrochemistry under conditions of both h(2) oxidation and h(2) production, using co as a complementary probe. the hydrogenases are ddhydab and cahyda from the bacteria desulfovibrio desulfuricans and clostridium acetobutylicum , and crhyda1 from the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii . rates of inactivation depend on the redox state of the active site  'h-cluster' and on transport through the protein to reach the pocket in which the h-cluster is housed. in all cases co reacts much faster than o(2). in the model proposed, cahyda shows the most sluggish gas transport and hence little dependence of inactivation rate on h-cluster state, whereas ddhydab shows a large dependence on h-cluster state and the least effective barrier to gas transport. all three enzymes show a similar rate of reactivation from co inhibition, which increases upon illumination: the rate-determining step is thus assigned to cleavage of the labile fe-co bond, a reaction likely to be intrinsic to the atomic and electronic state of the h-cluster and less sensitive to the surrounding protein.

TI  == disulfide bond-dependent mechanism of protection against oxidative stress in pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase of anaerobic desulfovibrio bacteria.
AB  == oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate forming acetyl-coenzyme a is a crucial step in many metabolic pathways. in most anaerobes, this reaction is carried out by pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (pfor), an enzyme normally oxygen sensitive except in desulfovibrio africanus (da), where it shows an abnormally high oxygen  stability. using site-directed mutagenesis, we have specified a disulfide bond-dependent protective mechanism against oxidative conditions in da pfor. our  data demonstrated that the two cysteine residues forming the only disulfide bond  in the as-isolated pfor are crucial for the stability of the enzyme in oxidative  conditions. a methionine residue located in the environment of the proximal [4fe-4s] cluster was also found to be essential for this protective mechanism. in vivo analysis demonstrated unambiguously that pfor in da cells as well as two other desulfovibrio species was efficiently protected against oxidative stress. importantly, a less active but stable da pfor in oxidized cells rapidly reactivated when returned to anaerobic medium. our work demonstrates the existence of an elegant disulfide bond-dependent reversible mechanism, found in the desulfovibrio species to protect one of the key enzymes implicated in the central metabolism of these strict anaerobes. this new mechanism could be considered as an adaptation strategy used by sulfate-reducing bacteria to cope with temporary oxidative conditions and to maintain an active dormancy.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.
