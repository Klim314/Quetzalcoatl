TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol beta-d-glucuronide, precursor of 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol in human sweat.
AB  == 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol (alpha-androstenol) is an important contributor to human axilla sweat odor. it is assumed that alpha-andostenol is excreted from the apocrine glands via a h2 o-soluble conjugate, and this precursor was formally characterized in this study for the first time in human sweat. the possible h2 o-soluble precursors, sulfate and glucuronide derivatives, were synthesized as analytical standards, i.e., alpha-androstenol, beta-androstenol sulfates, 5alpha-androsta-5,16-dien-3beta-ol (beta-androstadienol) sulfate, alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide, alpha-androstenol alpha-glucuronide, beta-androstadienol beta-glucuronide, and alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide furanose. the occurrence of alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide was established by ultra performance liquid chromatography (uplc)/ms (heated electrospray ionization (hesi)) in negative-ion mode in pooled human sweat, containing eccrine and apocrine secretions and collected from 25 female and 24 male underarms. its concentration was of 79 ng/ml in female secretions and 241 ng/ml in male secretions. the release of alpha-androstenol was observed after incubation of the sterile human sweat or alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide with a commercial glucuronidase enzyme, the urine-isolated bacteria streptococcus agalactiae, and the skin bacteria staphylococcus warneri dsm 20316, staphylococcus haemolyticus dsm 20263, and propionibacterium acnes atcc 6919, reported to have beta-glucuronidase activities. we demonstrated that if alpha- and beta-androstenols and androstadienol sulfates were present in human sweat, their  concentrations would be too low to be considered as potential precursors of malodors; therefore, the h2 o-soluble precursor of alpha-androstenol in apocrine  secretion should be a beta-glucuronide.

TI  == bacteria detected after instrumentation surgery for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis in a canine model.
AB  == objective: this study was designed to identify the presence, type and origin of bacteria adjacent to the metal implant in the infected region in a canine model of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis treated with single-stage anterior autogenous bone grafting and instrumentation. methods: dogs with pyogenic spondylodiscitis underwent one-stage debridement, autogenous bone grafting and titanium plate instrumentation and perioperative antibiotic therapy. the implants and adjacent vertebral bones were removed surgically at various postoperative time points (4,  8, 12 and 24 weeks) for bacteria detection. bacteria were detected from retrieved spinal implants as well as surrounding bones by culture and/or pyrosequencing methods in 17 (85%) of all 20 animals. the positive rate for bacteria presence was 45% by culture and 80% by pyrosequencing method. results: radiological or macroscopic examination showed no signs for infection recurrence in any animal regardless of bacteria presence at the surgical site. however, organism identical with the causative bacterium for spinal infection was found in only two of nine culture-positive animals. conclusion: within the confines of the study, the use of metallic implants in an infected area did not lead to a clinically relevant infection although bacteria may exist at the surgical site. the use of metallic implants in an infected area of the spine is safe. the metallic implants may not  be the "culprit" for the persistence or recurrence of infection.

TI  == multiplex pcr assay for species identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop and evaluate a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneous detection of 10 bacterial species causing bovine mastitis namely, staphylococcus  aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus sciuri, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus simulans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis and escherichia coli in milk. methods and results: a two-tube mpcr assay was developed. the accuracy of the mpcr was evaluated using 56 standard reference strains and 705 strains comprising of e. coli (n = 99), staphylococci (n = 522) and streptococci (n = 84). the threshold of detection of the mpcr assay was 10 fg of genomic dna and <10(3) cfu ml(-1). a comparative evaluation of mpcr with culture method using 115 milk samples from subclinical mastitis showed mpcr to be more efficacious. subsequently, the mpcr showed successful detection of target bacteria, when applied directly for the assessment of 36 bulk milk samples. conclusion: the developed mpcr assay was found to be simple, rapid, reliable and specific in species identification of 10 bacteria at a time. significance and impact of the study: the assay will be useful for the detection of mastitis, testing bacteriological safety of milk and for species level differentiation. the assay will be of value in the dairy sector for diagnosis and research. the early and accurate identification of pathogens will enable timely interventions for the treatment and control of bovine mastitis.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and streptococci from bovine subclinical mastitis cases.
AB  == the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of staphylococci and streptococci were assessed from subclinical mastitis cases. one hundred coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and 34 streptococci were identified. the most frequently isolated species were staphylococcus haemolyticus (27%) and staphylococcus simulans (24%). susceptible cns species revealed the highest resistance to penicillin g (58%), ampicillin (48%), neomycin (20%), and oleandomycin (14%). cns methicillin resistance rates within 82 isolates were 21.95% and 1.22% by disk diffusion and pcr methods, respectively. these results suggested the disk diffusion method was more prone to yield false positives. partial sequencing of the 16s rrna region from the meca carrying isolate (s. haemolyticus) was homologous with s. haemolyticus sequences/accessions obtained from genbank. however, the meca gene sequence from this isolate was more closely  allied with the s. aureus meca gene of human origins. identical sequence data was acquired from the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) database,  suggesting horizontal gene transfer between the two species. cns beta-lactamase activity within 81 isolates was 29.63%. the most frequently isolated streptococcus species were s. uberis (52%) and s. agalactiae (15%). oleandomycin  was the least effective antimicrobial agent on these isolates with 59% susceptibility. results indicated that cns and streptococci exhibited various antimicrobial resistance responses. consequently, isolation and identification of udder pathogens in herds suffering from subclinical agents is essential to select the most effective antimicrobial agent. moreover, multiple resistance features of methicillin resistant (mr) isolates should be considered during antimicrobial susceptibility tests.

TI  == microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  == background: the bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (olp) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. methods: bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed olp from the stomatology service, department of oral surgery and stomatology, school of dental medicine, university of bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. samples were taken from olp lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. the control population did not have olp and  was recruited from the student clinic. all samples were processed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. results: significantly higher bacterial counts of bacteroides ureolyticus (p = 0.001), dialister species (sp.) (p = 0.006), staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.007), and streptococcus agalactiae (p = 0.006) were found in  samples taken from olp lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of olp. significantly higher bacterial counts were found for capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus crispatus, mobiluncus curtisii, neisseria mucosa, prevotella bivia, prevotella intermedia, and s. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with olp compared to sites in control subjects (p  <0.001). conclusions: microbiologic differences were found between sites with olp and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of olp. specifically, higher counts of  staphylococci and s. agalactiae were found in olp lesions.

TI  == spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in kuwait.
AB  == objectives: to determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in kuwait over a period of 1 year. materials and methods: the vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the vitek automated system. in addition,  gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. results: the six overall most common isolates were: escherichia coli, accounting  for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by candida spp. (10.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), streptococcus agalactiae (gbs; 9.5%), enterococcus  faecalis (4.2%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. for the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to  the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. none of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. conclusion: these data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract  infection in the two hospitals studied.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == evaluation of the vitek 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the new vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n = 100), enterococcus spp. (n = 89), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the id-gpc identification card and with the ast-p515 (for staphylococci), ast-p516 (for enterococci and s. agalactiae) and ast-p506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. the identification comparison methods were the api staph for staphylococci and the api 20 strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was used. the vitek 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of s. aureus, 96.5% of s. agalactiae, 96.9% of s. pneumoniae, 92.7% of enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). more than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. according to the nccls breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for s. aureus, from 90 to 100% for cns, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for s. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for s. pneumoniae. microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were cns-erythromycin, cns-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. major errors were observed for cns-oxacillin and s. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the vitek 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == sample preparation of gram-positive bacteria for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.
AB  == a new sample preparation method was developed for fresh, whole-cell gram-positive bacteria to be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi tof ms). with fresh, whole-cell gram-negative bacteria of the enterobacteriaceae family, we had previously achieved spectra consisting of >50 peaks and mass ranges of 2-25 kda. because similar spectral quantity could not be achieved for gram-positive bacteria, using this same protocol, we investigated an alternative approach that focuses on the thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. gram-positive bacteria were incubated with 0.05-0.5 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min prior to being analyzed by maldi tof ms.  lysozyme is an enzymatically stable, 14-kda protein that specifically cleaves between peptidoglycan disaccharide subunits. a significant increase in overall number of peaks (>50) in the 2-14 kda range was observed without interference from the presence of lysozyme. we show that for four different species (staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, and s. agalactiae) reproducible subset of peaks were found within spectra from a reference strain and two unrelated clinical isolates. the data suggests that this sample preparation may be useful for increasing the overall number of peaks within spectra for subsequent development of bacterial identification strategies.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == internal bacterial flora of solid uterine cervical cancer.
AB  == twenty-five patients with uterine cervical cancer (two cases stage o; four cases  stage ia; five cases stage ib; one case stage iia; ten cases stage iib; two cases stage iiia; one case stage iva) served as the subjects. the bacterial flora inside the cervical cancers was investigated using the optimal technique. there was mixed abnormal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in all subjects. the average number of bacterial species isolated from inside the cervical cancers was 6.3. the predominant bacteria isolated were the aerobes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis, and prevotella bivia. as the stages of cervical cancer progressed, g.  vaginalis, b. distasonis and p. bivia were detected at higher rates and higher counts than other bacteria. these findings suggest that there is a relationship between g. vaginalis, b. distasonis and p. bivia and the onset and growth of cervical cancer.

TI  == cell wall deficient bacteria as a cause of idiopathic hematuria.
AB  == idiopathic hematuria in the absence of bacteriuria is a medical challenge. routine cultures of catheterized bladder and endoscopically obtained ureteral urine specimens from a 22-year-old woman with a 6-week history of hematuria showed no growth after 24 to 48 hours of incubation. however, bacterial variants  were grown on enriched media. colonies were typical cell wall deficient/defective bacteria. phase and electron microscopy of cystoscopic urine specimens obtained by retrograde ureteral catheterization as well as phase microscopy of the cultures revealed the classic morphology of these organisms. when the variant cultures were subcultured the organisms reverted to their related walled forms, that is streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus haemolyticus. because the colonies of these organisms showed various patterns of biochemical reactivity, each phenotype was tested against 15 antimicrobials. collectively, all biotypes had a common susceptibility to only nitrofurantoin. the patient was treated with  nitrofurantoin for 6 weeks. four days after initiation of therapy she had complete remission of hematuria. during the next 3 years she remained well and free of hematuria.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == [resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections (author's transl)].
AB  == the present status of resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections is reviewed. schematically it can outlined as follows. streptococcus b-haemolyticus as well as pneumococcus did not change their sensitivity to penicillin, but some strains are now resistant to tetracycline. streptococcus viridans, enterococcus and h. influenzae did not change substantially their sensitivity to antibiotics. staphylococcus aureus is the bacterial species that always poses some problems with regard to antibiotic resistance. due to the selection of strains penicillinase-producing because of the large use of penicillin, the most part of clinical isolates of staphylococci  is now resistant to penicillin. in addition an increased number of strains resistant to the other antibiotics has been registered as soon as they has been introduced in therapy. the resistant strains spread in a particularly rapid way in hospital. the introduction in therapy of penicillinase-resistant penicillins constituted a remarkable advance in therapy of staphylococcal infection. however, there is now a growing number of indications about the emergence of methicillin resistant strains of staphylococci. on the other hand it must be recalled that since 1960 a marked reduction of incidence and mortality in severe staphylococcal infections has been noted. incidence and mortality of respiratory infections due  to gram-negative bacilli is augmented particularly in connection with a larger use of immunosuppressive and antineoplastic therapies, of particular surgical or  reanimation procedures, of intensive courses of antibiotic therapy etc. emergence of pseudomonas, proteus, serratia, providencia, etc. infections poses many difficult problems of chemotherapy since these species are scarcely sensitive to  antibiotics. carbenicillin, cephalosporins, sisomicin, tobramycin, amikacin are the more recent drugs that alone or in combination may offer some chances of success in this field.
