TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. method and materials: the agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the  antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices activ point (chlorhexidine; roeko) and calcium hydroxide plus point (roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative  oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. the efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (wilcoxon's  signed rank test). results: activ point produced significantly larger inhibition  zones (p < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. conclusion: the chlorhexidine slow-release device (activ point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == extraction, partial purification and characterization of a bacteriocin (fragicilin) produced by a strain of bacteroides fragilis isolated from callithrix penicillata.
AB  == a strain of bacteroides fragilis, isolated from the marmoset callithrix penicillata, produced protein(s) with bacteriocin activity (fragicilin). two active fractions (36 and 150 kda) were isolated by chromatography. the bacteriocin exhibited iso- and heteroantagonism. it remained stable between ph 3  and 10 and at 60 degrees c for 24 h. pronase, trypsin, proteinase k and type vii  protease inactivated the bacteriocin, giving evidence of its protein nature.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == characterization of the streptococcus mutans gs-5 frua gene encoding exo-beta-d-fructosidase.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence (5,010 bp) of the fructanase gene (frua) and flanking regions of the chromosome of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was determined. the frua gene appears to be the sole transcript arising from a proximal promoter. the presumed precursor of the secreted frua protein consists of 1,423 amino acids, and it has an m(r) of 158,656 and a pi of 4.82. the n terminus of frua has characteristics in common with signal peptides of gram-positive organisms. the c  terminus consists of a serine- and threonine-rich region, followed by the peptide lpdtgd, 4 charged amino acids, 21 amino acids with a strongly hydrophobic character, and a charged pentapeptide tail, which are proposed to correspond to the wall-spanning region, the lpxtgx consensus sequence, and the membrane-spanning domains of surface-associated proteins of gram-positive cocci.  the frua protein has significant homology with the bacillus subtilis levanase (sacc), the bacteroides fragilis levanase (scrl), yeast invertases, and a number  of other beta-fructosidases but not with fructosyltransferase, glucosyltransferases, or glucan-binding proteins of oral streptococci. genes with homology to frua were detected in s. mutans serotype c, e, and f strains, streptococcus rattus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis. a deletion derivative of frua lacking the c-terminal 437 amino acids was still functional and could hydrolyze beta-(2,6)- and beta-(2,1)-linked sugars, but with altered preference for substrates. the data begin to define functional domains of the frua protein and potential regulatory sites for induction, repression, growth rate control, and posttranslational localization of this multifunctional enzyme.

TI  == microbial surface interactions: reduction of the haemagglutination activity of the oral bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum by absorption with streptococcus and bacteroides.
AB  == oral strains of fusobacterium nucleatum showed haemagglutination (ha) of sheep red blood cells and attachment of ha-active f. nucleatum fragments to other microorganisms allowed a means of studying microbial surface interactions. ha-active sonicated fragments (sf) prepared from f. nucleatum were mixed with whole cell suspensions of 48 bacterial strains and, after incubation, the whole cells were separated from the non-absorbed fragments by differential centrifugation. attachment of f. nucleatum fragments to the cells was indicated by a reduction in the ha activity of the sf in the supernatant fluid remaining after absorption with whole cells. ha activity of the microbial cells used for absorption and the detection of f. nucleatum fragments on these cells by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique provided further evidence of attachment.  of the 48 strains tested, 10 absorbed f. nucleatum ha-active fragments. they included bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides fragilis subsp. distasonis, bacteroides corrodens, streptococcus morbillorum, streptococcus sanguis (blackburn and jc 74) and streptococcus mutans aht, bht, 10449 and 6715. chelators revealed that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a ca2+-dependent interaction. sugar inhibition demonstrated that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a d-galactose-containing moiety on their surface. a reduction in the absorption of f. nucleatum ha-active fragments by strep. mutans grown in a higher concentration of sucrose was observed.
