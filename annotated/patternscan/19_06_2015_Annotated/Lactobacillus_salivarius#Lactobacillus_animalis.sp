TI  == probiotics in the prevention of eczema: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == objective: to evaluate a multistrain, high-dose probiotic in the prevention of eczema. design: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. settings: antenatal clinics, research clinic, children at home. patients:  pregnant women and their infants. interventions: women from 36 weeks gestation and their infants to age 6 months received daily either the probiotic (lactobacillus salivarius cul61, lactobacillus paracasei cul08, bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium bifidum cul20; total of 10(10) organisms/day) or matching placebo. main outcome measure: diagnosed eczema at age 2 years. infants were followed up by questionnaire. clinical examination and skin prick tests to common allergens were done at 6 months and 2 years. results: the cumulative frequency of diagnosed eczema at 2 years was similar in the probiotic (73/214, 34.1%) and placebo arms (72/222, 32.4%; or 1.07, 95% ci 0.72 to 1.6). among the secondary outcomes, the cumulative frequency of skin prick sensitivity at 2 years was reduced in the probiotic (18/171; 10.5%) compared with the placebo arm (32/173; 18.5%; or 0.52, 95% ci 0.28 to 0.98). the  statistically significant differences between the arms were mainly in sensitisation to cow's milk and hen's egg proteins at 6 months. atopic eczema occurred in 9/171 (5.3%) children in the probiotic arm and 21/173 (12.1%) in the  placebo arm (or 0.40, 95% ci 0.18 to 0.91). conclusions: the study did not provide evidence that the probiotic either prevented eczema during the study or reduced its severity. however, the probiotic seemed to prevent atopic sensitisation to common food allergens and so reduce the incidence of atopic eczema in early childhood. trial registration number: isrctn26287422.

TI  == assessment of probiotics supplementation via feed or water on the growth performance, intestinal morphology and microflora of chickens after experimental  infection with eimeria acervulina, eimeria maxima and eimeria tenella.
AB  == in this study, the effect of probiotic supplementation via drinking water or feed on the performance of broiler chickens experimentally infected with sporulated oocysts of eimeria acervulina (5 x 10(4)), eimeria maxima and eimeria tenella (2  x 10(4) each one) at 14 days of age was evaluated. two hundred and forty 1-day-old ross 308 male chicks were separated into eight equal groups with three  replicates. two of the groups, one infected with mixed eimeria oocysts and the other not, were given a basal diet and served as controls. the remaining groups were also challenged with mixed eimeria species and received the basal diet and either water supplemented with probiotic (three groups) or probiotic via feed (two groups); the probiotic used consisted of enterococcus faecium #589, bifidobacterium animalis #503 and lactobacillus salivarius #505 at a ratio of 6:3:1. probiotic supplementation was applied either via drinking water in different inclusion rates (groups w1, w2 and w3) or via feed using uncoated (group fn) or coated strains (group fc). the last group was given the basal diet  supplemented with the anticoccidial lasalocid at 75 mg/kg. each experimental group was given the corresponding diet or drinking water from day 1 to day 42 of  age. throughout the experimental period of 42 days, body weight and feed intake were recorded weekly and feed conversion ratios were calculated. seven days after infection, the infected control group presented the lowest weight gain values, while probiotics supplied via feed supported growth to a comparable level with that of the lasalocid group. probiotic groups presented lesion score values and oocyst numbers that were lower than in control infected birds but higher than in  the lasalocid group. in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, the highest villous height values were presented by probiotic groups. in conclusion, a mixture of probiotic substances gave considerable improvement in both growth performance and intestinal health in comparison with infected control birds and fairly similar improvement to an approved anticoccidial during a mixed eimeria infection.

TI  == lactobacillus faecis sp. nov., isolated from animal faeces.
AB  == three lactic acid bacteria were isolated from faeces of a jackal (canis mesomelas) and raccoons (procyron lotor). the isolates formed a subcluster in the lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic group, closely related to lactobacillus animalis, lactobacillus apodemi and lactobacillus murinus, by phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna and reca gene sequences. levels of dna-dna relatedness revealed that the isolates belonged to the same taxon and were genetically separated from their phylogenetic relatives. the three strains were non-motile, obligately homofermentative and produced l-lactic acid as the main end-product from d-glucose. the strains metabolized raffinose. the major cellular fatty acids in the three strains were c16 : 0, c18 : 1omega9c and c19 : 1 cyclo 9,10. based on the data provided, it is concluded that the three strains represent a novel species of the genus lactobacillus, for which the name lactobacillus faecis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is afl13-2(t) ( = jcm 17300(t) = dsm 23956(t)).

TI  == analysis of the human intestinal epithelial cell transcriptional response to lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, bifidobacterium lactis and escherichia coli.
AB  == the complex microbial population residing in the human gastrointestinal tract consists of commensal, potential pathogenic and beneficial species, which are probably perceived differently by the host and consequently could be expected to  trigger specific transcriptional responses. here, we provide a comparative analysis of the global in vitro transcriptional response of human intestinal epithelial cells to lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420, and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec). interestingly, l. salivarius ls-33 dce-induced changes were overall more similar to those of b. lactis 420 than to l. acidophilus ncfm, which is consistent with previously observed in vivo immunomodulation properties. in the gene ontology and pathway analyses both specific and unspecific changes were observed. common to all was the regulation of apoptosis and adipogenesis, and lipid-metabolism related regulation by the probiotics. specific changes such as regulation of cell-cell adhesion by b. lactis 420, superoxide metabolism by l. salivarius ls-33, and regulation of mapk  pathway by l. acidophilus ncfm were noted. furthermore, fundamental differences were observed between the pathogenic and probiotic treatments in the toll-like receptor pathway, especially for adapter molecules with a lowered level of transcriptional activation of myd88, trif, irak1 and traf6 by probiotics compared to ehec. the results in this study provide insights into the relationship between probiotics and human intestinal epithelial cells, notably with regard to strain-specific responses, and highlight the differences between transcriptional  responses to pathogenic and probiotic bacteria.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == dietary supplementation with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria is well tolerated and not associated with adverse events during late pregnancy and early infancy.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are increasingly being administered to pregnant women and infants with the intention of improving health. although these organisms have a long record of safe use, it is important to identify any adverse effects in potentially vulnerable populations. in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the safety of a bacterial dietary supplement for the prevention of atopy in infants. two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus salivarius cul61 and lactobacillus paracasei cul08) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20) with a total of 1 x 10(10) colony-forming units were administered  daily to women during the last month of pregnancy and to infants aged 0-6 mo. adverse events (ae) were classified according to who international statistical classification of diseases criteria. common symptoms were recorded by regular questionnaires. baseline characteristics of 220 mother-infant dyads in the treatment and 234 in the placebo group were similar. compliance with the trial interventions, loss to follow-up, symptoms, drug usage, infant growth, method of  feeding, visits to the doctor, and mothers' assessment of infant health were similar in the 2 groups. fifteen (6.8%) mothers and 73 (33.2%) infants in the treatment group and 21 (9.0%) mothers and 75 (32.1%) infants in the placebo group reported ae (p = 0.49 and p = 0.84, respectively). severe ae occurred in 18 mothers and 63 infants with a similar frequency in each group. none of the ae were attributed to the intervention. our findings support the safe use of this consortium of organisms during pregnancy and early infancy.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria and other gut bacteria in pigs by a macroarraying method.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) consist of many genera, gram-positive, and nonspore-forming micro-organisms; some members being used as probiotics while some others have negative effects on pig health. bacterial species in the gastrointestinal tract can produce antibacterial substances, reduce serum cholesterol in their host, or can be responsible for growth reduction, diarrhea,  and intestinal epithelial damage. it is therefore important for the pig industry  to evaluate the impact of food and farm management on the presence of "good" or "bad" bacteria and the risk for consumers. this articles focuses on the molecular identification of gut microflora species following different diets given to pigs  in uk and correlating the data on growth, health, and welfare. first of all, pig  feces were individually collected from sows before and after farrowing and also from piglets before and after weaning over several months. bacteria colonies were grown on mrs agar plates from feces and dna was extracted (qiaamp dna stool kit)  and amplified using 16s rdna (27f and 519r) primers. dna sequencing and sequence  alignment allowed us to identify species-specific zones, which were used as probes in a macroarray system also known as reverse line blot hybridization. some probes were found to be species specific for the following species: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. animalis, l. gallinarum, l. kitasanotis, l salivarius, streptococcus alactolyticus, s. hyointestinalis, and sarcina ventriculi. actual studies are now focusing on the impact of diets of the microflora in different gut parts and at different stages of the animal's life.

TI  == development of a competitive exclusion product for poultry meeting the regulatory requirements for registration in the european union.
AB  == competitive exclusion treatment is able to increase the pathogen colonization resistance of day-old chicks by applying probiotic bacteria stabilizing the indigenous microflora. in order to develop a safe microbial feed additive, various bacterial strains were isolated out of the gastrointestinal tract of healthy chickens. one hundred twenty-one representatives were selected based on differences in whole-cell protein patterns and screened for antagonistic properties. five effective strains (pediococcus acidilactici, enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. animalis, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salivarius) exhibited in vitro the ability to inhibit a range of common pathogens and were evaluated with regard to the risks associated with genetic transfer of antibiotic resistances from animals to humans via the food chain. the probiotic strains were sensitive to several clinically effective antibiotics, though some of them showed single resistances. none of the vancomycin-resistant (r) strains carried the enterococcal vana gene. two tetracycline r strains were shown to harbor a tet(m)-associated resistance. the strains contained no extrachromosomal dna and were not able to transfer the resistance by means of conjugation. on basis of the collected data the presence of easy transferable resistances was excluded and the chicken strains were considered to be suitable for the use as feed additive.

TI  == characterization of lactobacilli towards their use as probiotic adjuncts in poultry.
AB  == aims: a total of 112 strains of lactic acid bacteria of duck origin were studied  for their use as a probiotic feed supplement. methods and results: in vitro studies included aggregation, co-aggregation, cell surface hydrophobicity and adhesion activities on poultry crop cells and human hep2-cells. additionally, growth with bile acids (chicken bile, ox gall and taurocholic acid) and tolerance to acidic ph were tested. among all the isolates, two strains (lactobacillus animalis tmw 1.972 and lactobacillus salivarius tmw 1.992) were selected for a survival test in poultry. monitoring and differentiation of these strains was achieved by selective detection as rifampicin and erythromycin double-resistant mutants. after a single feed administration, both micro-organisms were shown to persist in the crop and caecum of ducks for a period of 18 and 22 days, respectively. for identification of lact. animalis and lact. salivarius, two specific pcrs targeted against 16s rdna were developed. conclusions: within the autochtoneous microflora of ducks, two strains of lactobacilli exhibited strong potential as probiotic adjuncts. the results indicate that the natural gut microflora of poultry serves as an excellent source for optimal strains. significance and impact of the study: a general strategy for the selection of probiotic strains is presented. the suggested sequence of tests allows identification of the most promising candidates within complex ecosystems or large strain collections with minimal expenditure.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == phylogeny of the defined murine microbiota: altered schaedler flora.
AB  == the "altered schaedler flora" (asf) was developed for colonizing germfree rodents with a standardized microbiota. the purpose of this study was to identify each of the eight asf strains by 16s rrna sequence analysis. three strains were previously identified as lactobacillus acidophilus (strain asf 360), lactobacillus salivarius (strain asf 361), and bacteroides distasonis (strain asf 519) based on phenotypic criteria. 16s rrna analysis indicated that each of the strains differed from its presumptive identity. the 16s rrna sequence of strain asf 361 is essentially identical to the 16s rrna sequences of the type strains of lactobacillus murinis and lactobacillus animalis (both isolated from mice), and all of these strains probably belong to a single species. strain asf 360 is a novel lactobacillus that clusters with l. acidophilus and lactobacillus lactis. strain asf 519 falls into an unnamed genus containing [bacteroides] distasonis, [bacteroides] merdae, [bacteroides] forsythus, and cdc group df-3. this unnamed genus is in the cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum and is most closely related to the genus porphyromonas. the spiral-shaped strain, strain asf 457, is  in the flexistipes phylum and exhibits sequence identity with rodent isolates of  robertson. the remaining four asf strains, which are extremely oxygen-sensitive fusiform bacteria, group phylogenetically with the low-g+c-content gram-positive  bacteria (firmicutes, bacillus-clostridium group). asf 356, asf 492, and asf 502  fall into clostridium cluster xiv of collins et al. morphologically, asf 492 resembles members of this cluster, roseburia cecicola, and eubacterium plexicaudatum. the 16s rrna sequence of asf 492 is identical to that of e. plexicaudatum. since the type strain and other viable original isolates of e. plexicaudatum have been lost, strain asf 492 is a candidate for a neotype strain. strain asf 500 branches deeply in the low-g+c-content gram-positive phylogenetic  tree but is not closely related to any organisms whose 16s rrna sequences are currently in the genbank database. the 16s rrna sequence information determined in the present study should allow rapid identification of asf strains and should  permit detailed analysis of the interactions of asf organisms during development  of intestinal disease in mice that are coinfected with a variety of pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == homofermentative lactobacillus species predominantly isolated from canine feces.
AB  == lactobacillus salivarius group biovars via and vib, which are homofermentative lactobacillus, were predominantly isolated from canine feces. identification and  biotyping of l. salivarius group biovars via and vib were originally done by mitsuoka et al. (1976). these strains were tentatively identified as l. salivarius by their phenotypic characteristics. they are, however, more similar to those of some new lactobacillus species, particularly l. animalis and l. murinus, than those of l. salivarius and have now been identified as l. animalis  by dna-dna homology.
