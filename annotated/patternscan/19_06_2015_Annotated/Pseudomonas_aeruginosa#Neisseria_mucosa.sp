TI  == isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  == endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. tree shrews (tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. to clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16s rdna full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), staphlococcus aureus (33%), s. epidermidis (75%), micrococcus luteus (25%), kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: neisseria mucosa (58%), streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: enterococcus faecalis (17%), lactococus lactis (33%), escherichia coli (92%), salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified  from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: s. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: n.mucosa (67%); anus: l. lactis (33%), e. coli (100%). these  results indicate that s. epidermidis, n. mucosa, l. lactis and e. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, s. aureus, m. luteus, k. gibsonii, e. faecalis  and s. typhosa were species-specific flora. this study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.

TI  == mucosal vaccination against bacterial respiratory infections.
AB  == mucosal vaccination offers attractive advantages to conventional systemic vaccination, such as higher levels of antibodies and protection at the airway surface. this review gives an overview of recent experimental and clinical data on nasal, oral and sublingual vaccines against bacterial respiratory pathogens, such as streptococcus pneumoniae , haemophilus influenzae , neisseria meningitidis , moraxella catarrhalis , bordetella pertussis , pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium tuberculosis . subsequently, we discuss further vaccine development that opens the focus to clinical use.

TI  == [the changes of bacteria group on oral mucosa after radiotherapy of postoperative patients of oral carcinoma].
AB  == objective: to investigate the microbial contents presented on the surface of mucosa in the oral cavity of patients who accepted radiotherapy, and to provide the evidences of controlling post-radiotherapeutic infections. methods: 32 patients (19 males and 13 females) aged from 37 - 72 received radiotherapy after  oral squamous cell carcinomas operation were selected. samples of saliva were obtained from the radiated center and opposite mucosa before and after radiotherapy. the detective amount, detective ratio and constituent ratio were analysed by cultivation and identification. results: streptococci, candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa significantly increased on both sides of the  oral mucosa while neisseria and actinobacillus decreased on radiated region after the radiotherapy. conclusion: radiotherapy has great effects on oral bacteria and pathogenic organism may play a role in post-radiotherapy infections. it is necessary to do bacteria culture and choose sensitive antibiotics regularly for post-radiotherapeutic patients.

TI  == phosphorylcholine decoration of lipopolysaccharide differentiates commensal neisseriae from pathogenic strains: identification of lica-type genes in commensal neisseriae.
AB  == phosphorylcholine (chop) is a potential candidate for a plurispecific vaccine, because it is present on surface components of many mucosal organisms, including  haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, chop has been detected on pili of neisseria meningitidis and neisseria  gonorrhoeae. in this study, we demonstrate the presence of the phosphorylcholine  epitope on the lipopolysaccharides (lpss) of several species of commensal neisseriae (cn), a property that differentiates commensal from the pathogenic strains of neisseriae. in an extended survey of 78 strains, we confirmed the exclusive expression of the chop epitope on pili of pathogenic neisseriae. despite the presence of pili on cn, which are homologous to class ii pili of n. meningitidis, they did not react with anti-chop antibody. this observation was further supported by the fact that 14c-labelled choline was incorporated only in  the lpss of cn. analysis of the lps of n. lactamica strain nl4 revealed two distinct and interconvertible molecular species of lps with high and low levels of reactivity with anti-chop antibody. in addition, on/off phase variation gave rise to frequent modulation in the levels of antibody reactivity. a concurrent modulation was also observed in the binding of c-reactive protein, crp, a chop-binding reactant that is implicated in bacterial clearance. genetic analysis showed the presence of a gene in several cn spp. with significant sequence identity to h. influenzae lica. this gene encodes choline kinase and is also involved in phase variation of the lps-associated chop in h. influenzae. in contrast, lica-like genes were not identified in the pathogenic neisseria strains tested. they are absent from n. meningitidis strain z2491 genome database. these  data suggest that the genetic basis for chop incorporation in cn lps resembles that in h. influenzae spp. and may be distinct from that generating the chop epitope on pili of pathogenic neisseriae. further, the modulation of chop expression on cn lps, and corresponding modulation of crp binding, has the potential to confer the property of immune avoidance and thus of persistence on mucosa.

TI  == [characteristics of fauces microflora in children treated in intensive care units].
AB  == characteristic features of fauces aerobic microflora in children treated in intensive care units (icu) were analysed. for comparison fauces microflora in children outpatients and in children patients from general surgical units was investigated. a retrospective analysis of all the smears without exception for 2  years (a total of 2120) revealed a direct dependence of the changes in the fauces microflora composition on the patient condition and the antibiotic load. it was shown that the fauces indigenic microflora in icu patients was more often replaced by enterococci, gramnegative enteric bacteria and nonfermenting bacteria which are not usual under the normal conditions. the flora in such cases was represented by monoculture. thus, microorganisms natural for the fauces i.e. haemophilus influenzae and neisseria spp. were not practically detected in the fauces of the icu patients (0.5 and 0.4 per cent, respectively). grampositive cocci in the children of the surgical units and in the outpatients included alpha-hemolytic streptococci in association with beta-hemolytic or nonhemolytic streptococci. no such bacteria were isolated from the icu newborns. the associations of gramnegative organisms from the icu patients included 40 variants. seventy-eight association variants of pseudomonas aeruginosa were mainly represented by the combinations with serratia spp. and klebsiella spp. as  well as with coagulase negative staphylococci or enterococci, especially in the icu newborns. the results of the study demonstrated that the target-aimed antibiotic therapy providing eradication of p.aeruginosa in the icu patients was  not always justified because of possible superinfection practically due to any organism from the association. massive antibiotic therapy with pressing on gramnegative flora in the icu patients induced selective contamination of the mucosa by polyresistant enterococci thus increasing their potential role in the development of hospital infections.

TI  == binding of progesterone to neisseria gonorrhoeae and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the binding of [1,2-(3)h]progesterone to progesterone-sensitive neisseria gonorrhoeae cs-7 and the progesterone-insensitive neisseria mucosa, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium (rough and smooth strains) was investigated. the kinetics of binding to n. gonorrhoeae cs-7 demonstrated that the majority of the progesterone binding occurred and equilibrium was reached within the first 30 min. despite the rapid binding of progesterone, only about 20% of the added steroid was bound at the cell concentration used throughout this study. whole cells of progesterone-insensitive bacteria bound progesterone less efficiently than the progesterone-sensitive n. gonorrhoeae cs-7. n. mucosa bound  low amounts of this steroid (20% of that bound by n. gonorrhoeae cs-7) whereas the other gram-negative bacteria exhibited little progesterone binding (<3% of that bound by n. gonorrhoeae cs-7). the outer membrane permeability of n. gonorrhoeae cs-7, as measured by crystal violet uptake and inhibition, was similar to the deep rough mutant of s. typhimurium ta 1535. the latter organism neither bound nor was inhibited by progesterone. however, isolated cell envelopes of n. gonorrhoeae and progesterone-insensitive bacteria all bound progesterone equally well. cortisone and cholesterol, althouh structurally similar to progesterone, were not inhibitory to n. gonorrhoeae and did not bind to whole cells as well as progesterone. the major site of progesterone binding appeared to be the cytoplasmic membrane, which bound four times more progesterone than the outer membrane. in addition, isolated cytoplasmic membrane proteins bound more than three times more progesterone per milligram of protein than the intact membrane.
