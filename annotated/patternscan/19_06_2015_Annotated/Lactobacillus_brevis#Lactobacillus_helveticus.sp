TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == species-specific quantification of probiotic lactobacilli in yoghurt by quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli strains with probiotic effects have been widely used in dairy  products such as yoghurts as well as in food additives and pharmaceuticals. despite their successful commercial application, the current species identification and quantification methods of the genus lactobacillus are time-consuming and labour-intensive. methods and results: to fulfil the requirements of a robust quality management, we have developed a quantitative real-time pcr assay based on the heat shock protein 60 gene (hsp60) for accurate  identification and quantification of five commercially important lactobacillus species. the developed assay allows an unambiguous species-specific detection of  the species lact. acidophilus, lact. brevis, lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lact. helveticus and lact. reuteri from bacterial cultures as well as directly from dairy products for instance yoghurt. conclusions: with the assay, we were able to specifically detect lactobacilli strains down to 10(5) cfu ml(-1) directly from yoghurt, which is a sufficient detection limit as commercial products usually contain 10(6) -10(12) cfu ml(-1) of probiotic strains. significance and impact of the study: the real-time pcr assay developed here might become a convenient tool enabling an accurate, fast and sensitive detection of probiotic lactobacilli commercially used in food.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  == strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included lactobacillus casei/lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus and pediococcus acidilactici. the susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in escherichia coli for comparison. analysis of l. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. e. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and  florfenicol. no extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == growth characterization of individual rye sourdough bacteria by isothermal microcalorimetry.
AB  == aims: the present work tests the feasibility of the isothermal microcalorimetry method to study the performance of individual lactic acid bacteria during solid-state fermentation in rye sourdough. another aim was to elucidate the key factors leading to the formation of different microbial consortia in laboratory and industrial sourdough during continuous backslopping propagation. methods and  results: strains of the individual lab isolated from industrial and laboratory sourdough cycle were grown in 10 kgy irradiated rye dough in vials of an isothermal calorimeter and the power-time curves were obtained. sugars, organic acids and free amino acids in the sourdough were measured. the od-time curves of  the lab strains during growth in flour extract or mrs (de man, rogosa and sharpe) broth were also determined. the maximum specific growth rates of lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus and leuconostoc citreum strains that dominated in backslopped laboratory sourdough were higher than those of lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus panis, lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus pontis strains originating from industrial  sourdough. industrial strains had higher specific growth rates below ph 4.8. it was supposed that during long-run industrial backslopping processes, the oxygen sensitive species start to dominate because of the o(2) protective effect of rye  sourdough. conclusions: measurements of the power-time curves revealed that the lab strains dominating in the industrial sourdough cycle had better acid tolerance but lower maximum growth rate and oxygen tolerance than species isolated from a laboratory sourdough cycle. significance and impact of the study: isothermal microcalorimetry combined with chemical analysis is a powerful method  for characterization of sourdough fermentation process and determination of growth characteristics of individual bacteria in sourdough.

TI  == characterization and separate activities of the two promoters of the lactobacillus brevis s-layer protein gene.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis atcc 8287 possesses a surface (s)-layer protein slpa, the gene of which is very efficiently expressed. to study the expression signals of the slpa gene, several different reporter plasmids, based on the low-copy-number  vector pkth2121 derived from pgk12, were constructed. in the reporter plasmids, only one of the two consecutive slpa promoters (p1, p2) was placed upstream of the lactobacillus helveticus proline iminopeptidase (pepi) gene, and defined parts of the sequences upstream of the promoter were deleted. as indicated by reporter enzyme activities, both promoters were efficiently recognized at different growth stages in l. brevis. an upstream region important for the full activity of p1 was identified. the quantification of pepi-specific mrna in l. brevis and sds-page indicated that slpa expression is not regulated at the post-transcriptional level and revealed no regulation of slpa promoters under the conditions tested. the high expression levels of both slpa and the reporter gene  in l. brevis were found to remain at a high level after the addition of bile or pancreatin in the growth medium or after a change of the carbon source, which is  advantageous for the potential use of slpa as a carrier in live oral vaccines.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of ugandan ghee.
AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

TI  == characterization of four plasmids harboured in a lactobacillus brevis strain encoding a novel bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, and construction of a shuttle vector for lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli.
AB  == in this study we isolated over 250 lactic acid bacteria (lab) candidates from fruit, flowers, vegetables and a fermented food to generate an lab library. one strain, designated 925a, isolated from kimchi (a traditional korean fermented dish made from chinese cabbage) produced a novel type of bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, which is effective against certain lab, including strains of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, bacillus and listeria. strain 925a, identified as lactobacillus brevis, harboured at least four plasmids and we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of each one. the four plasmids were designated plb925a01-04, and have molecular sizes of 1815, 3524, 8881 and 65 037 bp, respectively. we obtained bacteriocin non-producing derivatives by treatment of strain 925a with novobiocin. all of these derivatives, which were susceptible to  their own antibacterial product, lost the largest plasmid, plb925a04, suggesting  that the genes for bacteriocin biosynthesis (breb and brec) and immunity (bree) are located on plb925a04. the partial amino acid sequence of purified brevicin 925a and sequence analysis of plb925a04 showed that breb is the structural gene for brevicin 925a. we constructed a shuttle vector (ples003, 6134 bp) that can replicate in both escherichia coli and lab such as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus hilgardii and enterococcus hirae. to determine the function of gene bree, which displays no significant similarity  to any other sequences in the blast search database, the gene was inserted into ples003. a plb925a04-cured derivative transformed with ples003 carrying bree acquired immunity to brevicin 925a, suggesting that bree encodes an immunity protein.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == surface-layer protein extracts from lactobacillus helveticus inhibit enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 adhesion to epithelial cells.
AB  == adherence of intestinal pathogens, including escherichia coli o157:h7, to human intestinal epithelial cells is a key step in pathogenesis. probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus helveticus r0052 inhibit the adhesion of e. coli o157:h7  to epithelial cells, a process which may be related to specific components of the bacterial surface. surface-layer proteins (slps) are located in a paracrystalline layer outside the bacterial cell wall and are thought to play a role in tissue adherence. however, the ability of s-layer protein extract derived from probiotic bacteria to block adherence of enteric pathogens has not been investigated. human epithelial (hep-2 and t84) cells were treated with s-layer protein extract alone, infected with e. coli o157:h7, or pretreated with s-layer protein extract prior to infection to determine their importance in the inhibition of pathogen adherence. the effects of s-layer protein extracts were characterized by phase-contrast and immunofluorescence microscopy and measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance of polarized monolayers. pre-treatment of host epithelial cells with s-layer protein extracts prior to e. coli o157:h7 infection decreased pathogen adherence and attaching-effacing lesions in addition to preserving the barrier function of monolayers. these in vitro studies indicate that a non-viable constituent derived from a probiotic strain may prove effective in interrupting the infectious process of an intestinal pathogen.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in kefir grains and kefir made from them.
AB  == in an investigation of the changes in the microflora along the pathway: kefir grains (a)-->kefir made from kefir grains (b)-->kefir made from kefir as inoculum (c), the following species of lactic acid bacteria (83-90%) of the microbial count in the grains) were identified: lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and lactobacillus brevis. yeasts (10-17%) identified were kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida inconspicua and candida maris. in  the microbial population of kefir grains and kefir made from them the homofermentative lactic streptococci (52-65% and 79-86%, respectively) predominated. within the group of lactobacilli, the homofermentative thermophilic species l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and l. helveticus (70-87% of the isolated bacilli) predominated. along the pathway a-->b-->c, the streptococcal proportion in the total kefir microflora increased by 26-30% whereas the lactobacilli decreased by 13-23%. k. marxianus var. lactis was permanently present in kefir grains and kefirs, whereas the dominant lactose-negative yeast in the total yeast flora of the kefir grains dramatically decreased in kefir c.

TI  == the expression signals of the lactobacillus brevis slpa gene direct efficient heterologous protein production in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a cassette based on the expression signals of the lactobacillus brevis surface (s)-layer protein gene (slpa) was constructed. the low-copy-number vector pkth2095, derived from pgk12, was used as the cloning vector. the efficiency of slpa promoters in intracellular protein production was studied using three reporter genes, beta-glucuronidase (gusa), luciferase (luc) and aminopeptidase n  (pepn) in three different lactic acid bacteria hosts: lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus gasseri. the s-layer promoters were recognized in each strain and especially l. lactis and lb. plantarum exhibited high levels of transcripts. the production kinetics of reporter proteins was studied as a function of growth. the gusa, luc and pepn activities varied considerably among the lactic acid bacterial strains studied. the highest levels  of beta-glucuronidase and luciferase activity were obtained in l. lactis. the level of gusa obtained in l. lactis corresponded to over 15% of the total cellular proteins. the highest level of aminopeptidase n activity was achieved in lb. plantarum where pepn corresponded up to 28% of the total cellular proteins at the late exponential phase of growth. this level of pepn activity is 30-fold higher than that in lb. helveticus, which is the species from which the pepn gene originates.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == the lysins of bacteriophages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == this short review highlights the complete absence of literature on lysins of bacteriophages infecting species like s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, pediococcus and leuconostoc species, l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum  and l. brevis, which are also widely used in the dairy industry. the lysins described share some similar biochemical characteristics: optimal ph and temperature, site of hydrolysis inside the peptidoglycan, and some activators and inhibitors. the cloning of the genes encoding these lysins only began in the last few years and four of them have been completely sequenced. in the future, these lysin genes could be interestingly compared to the host autolysin(s) gene(s). by  contrast, the passage of phage lysins through the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell in order to reach the peptidoglycan (via a signal sequence or the presence of a holin) seems not to be clearly resolved. the presence of a second open-reading frame upstream from the gene of the lysin, enabling a putative holin to be encoded, has already been suggested. no doubt our ever increasing knowledge about bacteriophage genome organization will help to elucidate this question. meanwhile the obtention of a lactococcus strain with an autolytic phenotype, using a bacteriophage lysin gene, as well as the successful use of purified pl1 lysin to obtain protoplasts of l. casei encourage us to continue to explore the field of bacteriophage lysins.

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  == [bacteriocin typing of lactobacillus cultures using a basic set of bacteriocinogenic strains].
AB  == lactic bacilli of 15 species were divided into 78 bacteriocin types by their sensitivity spectra with respect to the main set of the bacteriocinogenic strains. l. acidophilus-l. salivarious, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. buchneri, l. helveticus, l. lactis and l. leichmannii were used in the study. the cultures were divided into 30, 9, 7, 25, 5, 20, 13, 8, 2.2 and 2 bacteriocin types respectively. the method of determining the lactic bacilli sensitivity spectra to 8 bacteriocinogenic strains of the main kit is simple and economic. it allows marking of lactic bacilli and their dividing into  bacteriocin types within the species. this may be used in taxonomy and epidemiological studies.

TI  == [sensitivity of lactobacilli of the subgenus thermobacterium to the action of bacteriocins].
AB  == sensitivity of 278 cultures of thermobacterium to 30 types of bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied with the method of delayed antagonism. it was shown that all cultures of l. salivarius, l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii and 94.1  per cent of l. acidophilus were sensitive to one or several bacteriocin types. the cultures of l. acidophilus, l. salivarius and l. jugurti, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. bulgaricus and l. delbrueckii were sensitive to 26, 15, 28, 2 and 29 lactocin types respectively.

TI  == [sensitivity of the lactobacilli of the subgenus streptobacterium to bacteriocins of lactobacilli of different species].
AB  == sensitivity of 167 cultures of lactobacilli of streptobacterium to 39 bacteriocins produced by l. acidophilus, l. jugurti, l. salivarius, l. lactis, l. helveticus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. fermenti, l. brevis and l. buchneri was studied. it was found that the cultures of l. casei were sensitive to 30 types of bacteriocins, while the cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to 9 bacteriocin  types. 89.6 per cent of the cultures of l. casei and all cultures of l. plantarum were sensitive to one or several bacteriocins produced by lactobacilli of different species.

TI  == pure culture fermentation of brined cucumbers.
AB  == the relative abilities of pediococcus cerevisiae, lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, and several other species of lactic acid bacteria to grow and produce acid in brined cucumbers were evaluated in pure culture fermentations. such fermentations were made possibly by the use of two techniques, gamma radiation (0.83 to 1.00 mrad) and hot-water blanching (66 to 80 c for 5 min), designed first to rid the cucumbers of naturally occurring, interfering, and competitive microbial groups prior to brining, followed by inoculation with the desired lactic acid bacteria. of the nine species tested, strains of the three common to  cucumber fermentations, p. cerevisiae, l. plantarum, and l. brevis, grew to the highest populations, and produced the highest levels of brine acidity and the lowest ph values in fermentations at 5.4 to 5.6% nacl by weight; also, their sequence of active development in fermentations, with the use of a three-species  mixture for inoculation, was in the species order just named. this sequence of occurrence was similar to that estimated by others for natural fermentations. the rates of growth and acid production in fermentations with a mixture of p. cerevisiae, l. plantarum, and l. brevis increased as the incubation temperature was increased from 21 to 27 to 32 c; however, the maximal populations and acidities attained were essentially the same for fermentations at each temperature. further, these same three species were found to be the most salt tolerant of those tested; their upper limit for appreciable growth and measurable acid production was about 8% salt, whereas thermophilic species such as l. thermophilus, l. lactis, l. helveticus, l. fermenti, and l. delbrueckii exhibited a much lower salt tolerance, ranging from about 2.5 to 4.0%. however, certain strains of l. delbrueckii grew very rapidly in cucumbers brined at 2.5 to 3.0% salt, and produced sufficient acid in about 30 hr at 48 c to reduce the brine ph  from above 7.0 to below 4.0. an inexpensive, pure culture fermentor which was suitable for gamma radiation, resistant to salt and acid, and which permitted repeated aseptic sampling of the fermenting brine, is illustrated and the specifications are given.
