TI  == treatment of acute otitis media with probiotics in otitis-prone children-a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study.
AB  == background & aims: to examine whether probiotics would reduce the occurrence or duration of acute otitis media (aom), or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children. methods: during this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week intervention, 309 otitis-prone children (10 months-6 years) consumed either one probiotic capsule (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii js) (n=155) or placebo (n=154) daily. clinical examinations were carried out and nasopharyngeal samples taken three times. parents recorded the symptoms of upper respiratory infection (uri) in a diary. results: probiotic treatment did not reduce the occurrence (probiotic vs. placebo: 72% vs. 65%, or=1.48, 95% ci 0.87-2.52, p=n.s.) or the recurrence ( three) of aom episodes (18% vs. 17%, or=1.04, 95% ci 0.55-1.96, p=n.s.). the median duration of aom episodes was 5.6 (iqr 3.5-9.4) vs. 6.0 (iqr 4.0-10.5) days, respectively (p= n.s.). there was a tendency showing a reduction in the occurrence of recurrent (4 to 6) respiratory infections in the probiotic group (or for 4 uris: 0.56, 95%ci 0.31-0.99, p=0.046; or for 6 uris: 0.59, 95% ci 0.34 to 1.03, p=n.s.). probiotics did not affect the carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae, but increased the prevalence of moraxella catarrhalis (or=1.79, 95% ci 1.06-3.00, p=0.028). conclusions: probiotics did not prevent the occurrence of aom or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children.  a tendency showing a reduction in recurrent respiratory infections must be confirmed in further studies.
