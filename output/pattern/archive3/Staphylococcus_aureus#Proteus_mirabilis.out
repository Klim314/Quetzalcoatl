antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of portuguese foeniculum vulgare fruits.
the aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the centre and south of portugal. composition of essential oils was established by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (gc-fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis. the obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. a total of 16 compounds were identified. the main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). the percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: aspergillus niger, a. japonicus, a. oryzae, fusarium oxysporum, rhizophus oryzae and r. stolonifer. antibacterial activity was assessed against three gram-positive strains: enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228 and s. aureus atcc 28213; and against six gram-negative strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922; morganella morganii lfg 08; proteus mirabilis lfg 04; salmonella enteritidis lfg 05; s. entiritidis serovar typhimurium lfg 06 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. the mic values varied from 62.5 (e. coli atcc 25922) to 2000 microml (p. aeruginosa atcc 27853).
antimicrobial and antifungal activity of pelargonium roseum essential oils.
purpose: the antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the xx(th) century. in the current study essential oils obtained from pelargonium roseum (geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the pelargonium essential oil was tested against gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and fungi (candida albicans). disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. results: inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. in the case of candida albicans, the complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. in the cases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. conclusion: the volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. there were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available pelargonium oils.
biomaterial modification of urinary catheters with antimicrobials to give long-term broadspectrum antibiofilm activity.
catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the commonest hospital-acquired infection, accounting for over 100,000 hospital admissions within the usa annually. biomaterials and processes intended to reduce the risk of bacterial colonization of the catheters for long-term users have not been successful, mainly because of the need for long duration of activity in flow conditions. here we report the results of impregnation of urinary catheters with a combination of rifampicin, sparfloxacin and triclosan. in flow experiments, the antimicrobial catheters were able to prevent colonization by common uropathogens proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli for 7 to 12weeks in vitro compared with 1-3days for other, commercially available antimicrobial catheters currently used clinically. resistance development was minimized by careful choice of antimicrobial combinations. drug release profiles and distribution in the polymer, and surface analysis were also carried out and the process had no deleterious effect on the mechanical performance of the catheter or its balloon. the antimicrobial catheter therefore offers for the first time a means of reducing infection and its complications in long-term urinary catheter users.
the preliminary assessment of anti-microbial activity of hplc separated components of kirkia wilmsii.
background: most communities in developing countries rely on traditional medicines for the treatment of diseases. in south africa, the limpopo province, within the lebowakgomo district, uses tuberous roots of kirkia wilmsii, after infusion in water for the treatment of a wide range of diseases by sotho communities. materials and methods: the main objective of the study was to assess the anti-microbial activity of separated aqueous components of the kirkia wilmsii tuberous roots. the clear aqueous extracts that were obtained after a 0.45 microm membrane filtration (millipore millex-hv hydrophillic pvdf filter), were then injected into a preparative high performance liquid chromatography instrument in which pure components, as shown by peaks, were collected and evaluated for anti-microbial activity against a range of microorganisms. results: the eight separated components were obtained, out of which four components showed anti-microbial activity (ama). the freeze dried components were re-dissolved in deionised water and then evaluated for ama against vibrio cholerae, shigella dysenteriae, aeromonas hydrophilia, salmonella typhi proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and enterobacter aerogenes. component one exhibited antimicrobial activity against shigella dysenteriae, aeromonas hydrophilia, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), of 3.445 mg/ml. component five was only active against proteus mirabilis with a mic of 0.08 mg/ml. component 7, was active against shigella dysenteriae, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli with a mic of 0.365 mg/ml against both shigella dysenteriae and staphylococcus aureus and 0.091 mg/ml against escherichia coli. component 8, was active against shigella, aeromonas hydrophilia, salmonella, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli with a mic of 155 mg/ml. conclusion: only four out of eight aqueous extracts showed ama against both gram negative and positive bacteria and showed no ama against candida albicans, enterobacter aerogenes and vibrio cholerae. therefore the kirkia wilmsii plant root may be used as a broad spectrum antibiotic.
antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of mentha longifolia l. and hydroalcoholic extract of zataria multiflora boiss. plants against important human pathogens.
objective: to determine the potential antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts from mentha longifolia l. (m. longifolia) and hydroalcoholic extract of zataria multiflora boiss. (z. multiflora) against important human pathogens. methods: pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella dysenteriae, klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumonia), enterobacter cloacae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus were kinds of pathogenic bacteria to determine the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of m. longifolia and hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora using broth microdiluation method. results: the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.25 and 2.5 mg/ml) were observed by the hydroalcoholic extract of z. multiflora and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for k. pneumonia and serratia marcescens (2.5 and 5 mg/ml) were observed by the aqueous extracts of m. longifolia. conclusions: in conclusion, it seems that z. multiflora and m. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of the mentioned bacteria.
anti-biofilm activity of biogenic selenium nanoparticles and selenium dioxide against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-biofilm activity of biologically synthesized selenium nanoparticles (se nps) against the biofilm produced by clinically isolated bacterial strains compared to that of selenium dioxide. thirty strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were isolated from various specimens of the patients hospitalized in different hospitals (kerman, iran). quantification of the biofilm using microtiter plate assay method introduced 30% of s. aureus, 13% of p. aeruginosa and 17% of p. mirabilis isolates as severely adherent strains. transmission electron micrograph (tem) of the purified se nps (produced by bacillus sp. msh-1) showed individual and spherical nano-structure in the size range of 80-220nm. obtained results of the biofilm formation revealed that selenium nanoparticles inhibited the biofilm of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and p. mirabilis by 42%, 34.3%, and 53.4%, respectively, compared to that of the non-treated samples. effect of temperature and ph on the biofilm formation in the presence of se nps and seo2 was also evaluated.
bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
in vitro activity of plazomicin against 5,015 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals as part of the canward study, 2011-2012.
plazomicin is a next-generation aminoglycoside that is not affected by most clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. the in vitro activities of plazomicin and comparator antimicrobials were evaluated against a collection of 5,015 bacterial isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between january 2011 and october 2012. susceptibility testing was performed using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method, with mics interpreted according to clsi breakpoints, when available. plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with all species except proteus mirabilis having an mic90 of </=1 mug/ml. plazomicin was active against aminoglycoside-nonsusceptible escherichia coli, with mic50 and mic90 values identical to those for aminoglycoside-susceptible isolates. furthermore, plazomicin demonstrated equivalent activities versus extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-esbl-producing e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, with 90% of the isolates inhibited by an mic of </=1 mug/ml. the mic50 and mic90 values for plazomicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa were 4 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively, compared with 4 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively, for amikacin. plazomicin had an mic50 of 8 mug/ml and an mic90 of 32 mug/ml versus 64 multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates. plazomicin was active against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, with both having mic50 and mic90 values of 0.5 mug/ml and 1 mug/ml, respectively. in summary, plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a diverse collection of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci obtained over a large geographic area. these data support further evaluation of plazomicin in the clinical setting.
antibacterial activity of the roots, stems and leaves of alchornea floribunda.
ethnopharmacological relevance: alchornea floribunda mull. arg. is used in traditional medicine across africa for the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and inflammatory disorders. aim of the study: to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the crude extracts of different plant parts in order to provide a scientific rationale for the proposed broad efficacy of alchornea floribunda in the treatment of bacterial infections. materials and methods: extracts of roots, stems and leaves were prepared using solvents of various polarities in order to extract a wide range of phytochemicals. the antibacterial activity of these crude extracts was evaluated by micro-dilution assay, against gram-positive (i.e. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus saprophyticus) as well as gram-negative (i.e. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and proteus mirabilis) bacteria. results: generally, the ethanol (etoh), methanol (meoh), ethyl acetate (etoac) and chloroform (chcl3) extracts demonstrated the best activities, with the leaves exhibiting the highest average activity for six of the eight pathogens. of these, the ethanolic leaf extract was the most active against staphylococcus aureus with an mic value of 50microg/ml. some other notable activity was observed for the ethyl acetate and chloroform root extracts against staphylococcus aureus (50microg/ml), and for selected stem extracts against staphylococcus aureus (50microg/ml), klebsiella pneumoniae (63microg/ml) and staphylococcus saprophyticus (63microg/ml). conclusion: this study demonstrates the promising antibacterial activity of alchornea floribunda against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria responsible for gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and urinary ailments, and validates its use in the ethnopharmacology of the region.
evaluation of antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles green-synthesized  using pineapple leaf (ananas comosus).
pineapple leaf was used in this study for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles based on the search for sustainable synthetic means. indeed, this offered an economical and sustainable synthetic route relative to expensive and toxic chemical methods. the leaf extract was used and the corresponding nanoparticles obtained were subjected to uv-vis analysis at different times. the uv-vis was used to monitor the silver nanoparticle formation through sampling at time intervals. the formation of silver nanoparticles was apparently displayed within 2 min with evidence of surface plasmon bands (spb) between 440 and 460 nm. the crystals was equally characterized using ftir, x-ray diffraction methods and tem. the different results obtained suggested the appearance of silver nanoparticles (snps) as determined by the process parameters with a particle size of 12.4 nm. the sample was further screened against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli using gentamicin as control. from the results, there is evidence of inhibition towards bacteria growth. it can now be inferred from the studies that biosynthesis of nanoparticles could be a gateway to our numerous health issues.
identification of three novel avian beta-defensins from goose and their significance in the pathogenesis of salmonella.
here, we report the characterization of three avian beta-defensins (avbds) from the goose, named anser_avbd1, avbd3, and avbd6, respectively. all of anser_avbds exhibited broad antibacterial activity. in addition, the antibacterial activity of all of the avbds against staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis decreased significantly in the presence of 100mm nacl (p<0.01). none of the avbds showed hemolytic activity. in order to assess the significance of these anser_avbds in the infection of salmonella enteritidis, mrna expression of toll-like receptor (tlr) 4 and anser_avbds in tissues of both control and infected geese was evaluated. we observed a significant up-regulation of tlr4, anser_avbd1, 3, and 6 in some immune tissues evaluated, in response to s. enteritidis infection. these data demonstrated that tlr4 may serve a possible role in eliciting host immune responses to pathogens, and beta-defensins may play a pivotal role in the host defense mechanisms of the goose.
convenient syntheses of cyanuric chloride-derived nhc ligands, their ag(i) and au(i) complexes and antimicrobial activity.
convenient syntheses of mono- and bis-imidazolium 1,3,5-triazine derivatives bearing piperidine and morpholine substituents are reported. in situ deprotonation of the mono-imidazolium salts and reaction with ag2o or au(tht)cl (tht = tetrahydrothiophene) precursors affords the corresponding ag(nhc)cl and au(nhc)cl carbene complexes. in the presence of ag(i) or au(i) salts the bis-imidazolium pincers eliminate the imidazolium group to afford -ome or -nme2 substituted triazines depending on the solvent used. in solution, the ag(i) and au(i) complexes show a barrier to rotation about the ctriazine-namine bonds, with calculated deltag( not equal) barriers in the region of 70 kj mol(-1). single crystal x-ray structures of several of the proligands and their corresponding ag(i) and au(i) complexes were obtained. these universally reveal an extended, rigidly planar pi-conjugated network between the triazine core, imidazolium/imidazolylidene substituents and exocyclic amine functions, to which the origin of the rotational barrier observed in solution is attributed. only very weak ntriazine-metal interactions are observed in the solid state, as indicated by small deviations of the cnhc-ag-cl bond angles from 180 degrees and also supported by dft calculations on the ag(nhc)cl complex (nhc = 4,6-dipiperidinyl-2-methylimidazolylidene triazine). preliminary antimicrobial susceptibility studies against five microorganisms (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus nctc 13277, s. aureus nctc 6571, pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc 10662, proteus mirabilis nctc 11938 and candida albicans atcc 90028) show that the above triazine-based ag-nhc complexes are active antimicrobial and antifungal agents.
antimicrobial activity of willowherb (epilobium angustifolium l.) leaves and flowers.
since the aetiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (bhp) is still unknown, the use of medicinal herb extracts and products prepared thereof are recommended due to their antimicrobial activity, especially during early stages of bhp. a comparison was performed of the in vitro antimicrobial activity (using broth microdilution assay) of flowers and leaves of willowherb (epilobium angustifolium l., onagraceae) from mt. velebit (croatia). the strains (standard atcc and clinical isolates) of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli (including p-fimbriae positive strain), pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, candida albicans, c. tropicalis, c. dubliniensis and saccharomyces cerevisiae were susceptible with mic values between 4.6+/-0.2 and 18.2+/-0.8 mg/ml. the results of in vitro studies showed that no differences were found in the antimicrobial activity between the ethanol extracts of leaves and flowers of e. angustifolium. using the quantitative fluorescent assay with ethidium bromide and acridine orange, the viability of c. albicans atcc 10231 was assessed after in vitro exposure to e. angustifolium leaf and flower ethanol extracts. apoptosis of c. albicans blastospores dominated over necrosis in all treated samples after short-term exposure with 6 to 12 mg/ml of extracts. in addition to the valuable biological activity of e. angustifolium extracts, the data obtained from the in vitro diffusion, the dilution assay and antifungal viability fluorescent assay suggest that leaf and flower ethanol extracts of e. angustifolium l. are a promising complementary herbal therapy of conditions such as bhp.
antibacterial activity of mangrove leaf extracts against human pathogens.
the antibacterial activity of leaf extract of mangroves, namely, rhizophora mucronata, sonneratia alba and exoecaria agallocha from chorao island, goa was investigated against human bacterial pathogens staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sp., salmonella typhi, proteus vulgaris and proteus mirabilis. as compared to aqueous, ethanol extract showed broad-spectrum activity. the multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria salmonella typhi was inhibited by the ethanol extract of s. alba leaf whereas the other two resistant bacteria staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus sp. were inhibited by the ethanol extract of leaves of all the species. the aqueous extract of s. alba and e. agallocha showed their activity against p. vulgaris and p. mirabilis, respectively. phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of saponins, glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, phenol and volatile oils in the leaves of mangroves. further studies using different solvents for extraction are necessary to confirm that mangroves are a better source for the development of novel antibiotics.
serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of ssis.
background: despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (ssis) is still high. an improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. the aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. methods: a total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. results: after single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, and non-esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. moreover, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus viridans were also inhibited. we found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring: at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional ssis. conclusions: these preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of ssis in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.
chemical composition and antimicrobial and allelopathic activity of tunisian conyza sumatrensis (retz.) e.walker essential oils.
conyza sumatrensis (retz.) e.walker (asteraceae) is a spontaneous annual herb, fairly widespread throughout tunisia, which has rarely been studied or valued in any sector. essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation of different parts (flower heads, leaves, stems, and roots) of c. sumatrensis plants, which were collected in autumn (november 2007) at the flowering stage in the area of monastir, tunisia. in total, 98 compounds, representing 88.1-99.3% of the oil composition, were identified by gc-fid and gc/ms analyses. the root essential oil was distinguished by its high content in acetylenes (matricaria ester, 4; 74.3%), while those from flower heads and leaves were dominated by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (61.1 and 50.3%, resp.). the oils of c. sumatrensis from tunisia belonged to a matricaria ester/caryophyllene oxide chemotype. all the oils were evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, and allelopathic activities. the results indicate that the leaf oil exhibited significant in vitro antibacterial activity against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and proteus mirabilis and that the c. sumatrensis oils isolated from the aerial parts presented high mycelia-growth inhibition of candida albicans and the filamentous fungi tested. moreover, the essential oils of the different plant parts inhibited the shoot and root growth of raphanus sativus (radish) seedlings. indeed, the inhibition of the hypocotyl growth varied from 28.6 to 90.1% and that of the radicle from 42.3 to 96.2%.
the effect of copper(ii), iron(ii) sulphate, and vitamin c combinations on the weak antimicrobial activity of (+)-catechin against staphylococcus aureus and other microbes.
few attempts have been made to improve the activity of plant compounds with low antimicrobial efficacy. (+)-catechin, a weak antimicrobial tea flavanol, was combined with putative adjuncts and tested against different species of bacteria. copper(ii) sulphate enhanced (+)-catechin activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa but not staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis or escherichia coli. attempts to raise the activity of (+)-catechin against two unresponsive species, s. aureus and e. coli, with iron(ii) sulphate, iron(iii) chloride, and vitamin c, showed that iron(ii) enhanced (+)-catechin against s. aureus, but not e. coli; neither iron(iii) nor combined iron(ii) and copper(ii), enhanced (+)-catechin activity against either species. vitamin c enhanced copper(ii) containing combinations against both species in the absence of iron(ii). catalase or edta added to active samples removed viability effects suggesting that active mixtures had produced h(2)o(2)via the action of added metal(ii) ions. h(2)o(2) generation by (+)-catechin plus copper(ii) mixtures and copper(ii) alone could account for the principal effect of bacterial growth inhibition following 30 minute exposures as well as the antimicrobial effect of (+)-catechin-iron(ii) against s. aureus. these novel findings about a weak antimicrobial flavanol contrast with previous knowledge of more active flavanols with transition metal combinations. weak antimicrobial compounds like (+)-catechin within enhancement mixtures may therefore be used as efficacious agents. (+)-catechin may provide a means of lowering copper(ii) or iron(ii) contents in certain crop protection and other products.
1-alkyl-(n,n-dimethylamino)pyridinium bromides: inhibitory effect on virulence factors of candida albicans and on the growth of bacterial pathogens.
a homologous series of 1-alkyl-(n,n-dimethylamino)pyridinium bromides, termed compounds 1-11, was synthesized and studied for antibacterial and antifungal activity. of these, compound 8, containing a ten-carbon alkyl chain, showed maximum inhibition against all the tested bacterial strains. the highest antibacterial activity using a disc diffusion method was recorded against mycobacterium smegmatis [zone of inhibition (zoi): 45.75+/-0.25 mm], followed by escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, vibrio cholerae, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella typhi. in addition to antibacterial activity, compounds 3-11 displayed good inhibitory action against the human opportunistic yeast pathogens cryptococcus neoformans and various candida spp. the maximum zoi was observed against cryptococcus neoformans (51.5+/-0.5 mm) using compound 8, with zois of 23.5+/-0.5, 32.0+/-0.0, 27.75+/-0.25 and 41.5+/-0.5 mm against candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis and candida krusei, respectively. furthermore, compound 8 caused inhibition of the candidal yeast-hyphae transition at a concentration of 0.29 microm and also inhibited the secretion of extracellular hydrolytic enzyme such as secreted aspartyl proteinase at subinhibitory concentrations. compound 8 showed very little haemolytic activity at a concentration of 0.58 microm (1.315+/-0.75 %), with its highest haemolytic activity (47.806+/-2.32 %) observed at a concentration of 2.9 microm.
impact of ph on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
objective: although major impairment of activity at lower ph values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). until now, there is little evidence for the influence of ph on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. methods: bacterial growth curves of staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), klebsiella oxytoca (atcc 700324), proteus mirabilis (atcc 14153), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) were performed in mueller-hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a ph of between 5.0 and 8.0. bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the mic. results: while no difference in the bacterial growth of e. coli, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca was observed at different ph values, bacterial growth of e. faecalis was significantly reduced at low ph. acidification to ph 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. conclusion: the present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of utis should be carefully considered. while growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during utis, the most common pathogen, e. coli, was not affected by low ph. independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, ph values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.
antimicrobial activity of terminalia arjuna wight & arn.: an ethnomedicinal plant against pathogens causing ear infection.
ear infection is one of the common diseases occurring throughout the world. different etiological agents are responsible for ear infections. aim: to assess the antimicrobial potential of terminalia arjuna leaves and bark extracts against staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, escherchia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, pathogens causing ear infections and their comparison with locally available ear drops. materials and methods: methanol, ethanol, acetone, aqueous (hot and cold) extracts from the leaves and bark of t. arjuna were tested for their antimicrobial activity. results: of the three organic solvents evaluated, acetonic leaf extract was found to be best against s. aureus. organic bark extract showed almost equal inhibition of all tested gram negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. however, aqueous extract of t. arjuna bark exhibited good activity against s. aureus. all the extracts were unable to exhibit any antifungal activity. conclusion: organic extract obtained from the t. arjuna bark and leaves may be used to treat the bacterial ear pathogens especially s. aureus, which has shown greater inhibition zones than the herbal drops, however, we still need more detailed studies as in vivo testing and pharmacokinetics properties for their therapeutic utility in treating ear infections.
the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

objective: to screen the antimicrobial potential of three ethnomedicinal plants chassalia curviflora thw. (c. curviflora), cyclea peltata hook. f. & thomson (c. peltata) and euphorbia hirta l (e. hirta) used in folk medicines in aarukani hills kani tribe, tamil nadu, india against human bacterial pathogens. methods: antibacterial efficacy was performed by disc diffusion method against the pathogens viz., escherichia coli (e. coli) (atcc 35218), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) (atcc 6538), salmonella typhi (s. typhi) (mtcc 733), proteus vulgaris (p. vulgaris), proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis) and streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes) and incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c. results: the maximum degree of antibacterial activity was observed in c. peltata followed by c. curviflora. while e. hirta showed comparatively low degree of antibacterial activity. the methanolic extract of c. peltata showed the antibacterial activity against three pathogens viz., s. pyogenes, p. vulgaris and e. coli with the inhibition zones 12 mm, 10 mm and 9 mm, respectively. hexane extracts of c. peltata also showed the antibacterial activity against two selected pathogens viz., p. vulgaris and p. mirabilis with 15 mm and 12 mm of inhibition zones. all the three different concentrations (0.25, 0.50 & 0.75 mg/ml) of methanolic extract of c. peltata show the inhibitory effect on the three susceptible bacteria s. pyogenes, p. vulgaris and e. coli with the maximum inhibition in the highest concentration (0.75 mg/ml). the methanolic and hexane extracts of c. curviflora exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium each i.e. p. vulgaris and s. typhi with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively. the methanolic and hexane extracts of e. hirta exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium i.e. s. pyogenes with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively. conclusions: the present investigation revealed that the c. curviflora, c. peltata and e. hirta are potentially good source of antibacterial agents and demonstrates the importance of such plants in traditional medicines.
lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
synergistic combination of chitosan acetate with nanoparticle silver as a topical antimicrobial: efficacy against bacterial burn infections.
chitosan and nanoparticle silver are both materials with demonstrated antimicrobial properties and have been proposed singly or in combination as constituents of antimicrobial burn dressings. here, we show that they combine synergistically to inhibit the in vitro growth of gram-positive methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter baumannii), as judged by bioluminescence monitoring and isobolographic analysis, and also produce synergistic killing after 30 min of incubation, as measured by a cfu assay. the hypothesized explanation involves chitosan-mediated permeabilization of bacterial cells, allowing better penetration of silver ions into the cell. a dressing composed of freeze-dried chitosan acetate incorporating nanoparticle silver was compared with a dressing of chitosan acetate alone in an in vivo burn model infected with bioluminescent p. aeruginosa. the survival rates of mice treated with silver-chitosan or regular chitosan or left untreated were 64.3% (p = 0.0082 versus regular chitosan and p = 0.0003 versus the control), 21.4%, and 0%, respectively. most of the fatalities occurred between 2 and 5 days postinfection. silver-chitosan dressings effectively controlled the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. these data suggest that a dressing combining chitosan acetate with silver leads to improved antimicrobial efficacy against fatal burn infections.

ceftaroline activity against pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin  structure infections: results from an international surveillance study.
objectives: to assess the spectrum and potency of ceftaroline, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal cephalosporin, against a 2008 surveillance collection of clinical isolates from patients in the usa and europe. methods: a collection of 14 169 isolates of various bacterial species from complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) was tested for susceptibility to ceftaroline and 19 comparator agents in a central reference laboratory using clsi broth microdilution methods. organisms were received from 55 medical centres; 27 in the usa and 28 in europe (12 countries, including israel). the clonality of isolates of staphylococcus aureus with elevated ceftaroline mics (4 mg/l) was determined by pfge and single and multilocus sequence typing, and the mechanism of ceftaroline non-susceptibility was assessed by molecular methods (pcr amplification and sequencing). results: ceftaroline, the active component of the parenteral prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, was active against 2988 methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates, with an mi(9)(0) of 1 mg/l. the mic(9)(0) for methicillin-susceptible strains was 0.25-0.5 mg/l. ceftaroline was additionally active against coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic(9)(0), 0.5-1 mg/l), enterococcus faecalis (mic(5)(0), 2 mg/l), beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci (mic(9)(0), 0.015-0.25 mg/l) and three commonly isolated enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and proteus mirabilis; mic(9)(0) values of 0.25 to > 16 mg/l). all but four isolates of mrsa (0.13%) had ceftaroline mic values of </= 2 mg/l. the isolates for which ceftaroline mics were 4 mg/l were clonal (single greek hospital) and had detectable meca mutations (n146k, n204k, e150k and h351n). conclusions: the ceftaroline yearly (2008) surveillance for the usa and europe documented low mic(5)(0)/(9)(0) values for mrsa isolates at 1/1 and 1/2 mg/l, respectively. ceftaroline demonstrated promising potency and coverage against gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause csssis, including mrsa and beta-haemolytic streptococci.
bacterial contamination of ram semen, antibiotic sensitivities, and effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c.
this study was designed to determine the degree and type of bacterial contamination of ejaculated semen samples in fertile rams and its consequences on sperm quality during storage. in experiment 1, 68 ejaculates from 36 rams were divided into two aliquots, one of which was used for bacterial culture, while the other one was diluted, stored at 15 degrees c and assessed for plasma membrane integrity and motility at 0, 24 and 48h after dilution. from the 68 ejaculates, 66 were positive for aerobic bacteria, including 20 species of bacteria from 14 genera. the most frequently isolated bacteria were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermis, and staphylococcus aureus species. these 5 bacteria were present in 97% of all contaminated samples. all contaminant bacteria were found to be sensitive to gentamicin and to ceftiofur, with variable percentages of resistance to the other antibiotics evaluated. in samples with total enterobacteria count lower than 100 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, higher proportions of motile and progressive sperm and higher velocities of spermatozoa were observed at different times during storage. in experiment 2, pure cultures of the most frequently isolated bacteria were individually added to fresh semen samples of low contamination and tested for their effects on sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c. semen with e. coli showed a drastic reduction in motility, velocity and viability during storage. this reduction was also significant, but less drastic, in semen with e. cloacae and p. mirabilis, whereas it was partial and less pronounced in the other groups (s. epidermidis and s. aureus). in conclusion, the contamination of ram semen with enterobacterial species reduced sperm quality during storage at 15 degrees c, and the antibiotics gentamicin and ceftiofur showed the higher antimicrobial activities.
seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd in southern brazil.
the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd grown in southern brazil was analyzed by gc-ms, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. the yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. the results obtained from principal components analysis (pca) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. the samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. samples collected during winter contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). in autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. the observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. the essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, and enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), indicated that s. aureus, b. subtilis, and candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest mic values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/ml, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/ml, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/ml, respectively.
chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) fruits from different regions.
structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) obtained from different regions (germany, india, and turkey). the main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. it was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. the highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from germany and india was higher than that of kefe cumin fruits obtained from turkey. the fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris (fmc 1), proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus (fmc 19), aeromonas hydrophila (atcc 7965), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 15753), klebsiella pneumoniae (fmc 5), salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes (ccm 2531) and escherichia coli (atcc 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.
aim of the study: the aerial parts of thymus kotschyanus boiss. and hohen. (lamiaceae) and flower buds of dianthus caryophyllus l. (caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. in this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. materials and methods: compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: tlc, ftir spectra and hplc. the minimum inhibitory concentrations mic values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. results: two known compounds were isolated from the essential oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. the isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thymol mic values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and b. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a mic value of 15.6 microg/ml. eugenol achieved stronger mic values against most tested pathogens and the best mic value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes and k. pneumoniae whereas, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and e. coli were inhibited with a mic value of 31.2 microg/ml. combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the best synergistic result was seen against p. mirabilis and e. coli. conclusions: the isolation of two antibacterial compounds from thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
synthesis and structure of silver complexes with nicotinate-type ligands having antibacterial activities against clinically isolated antibiotic resistant pathogens.
the synthesis and low-temperature x-ray crystal structures of five new silver complexes, [ag(2)-mu-o,o'(2-aminonicotinium)(2)(no(3))(2)](n) (7), [ag(isonicotinamide)(2)-mu-o,o'(no(3))](2) (8), [ag(ethyl nicotinate)(2)](no(3)) (9), [ag(ethyl isonicotinate)(2)(no(3))] (10), and [ag(methyl isonicotinate)(2)(h(2)o)](no(3)) (11), are presented and fully characterized by spectral and elemental analysis. the antimicrobial activities of these complexes were screened using 12 different clinical isolates belonging to four pathogenic bacteria, s. aureus, s. pyogenes, p. mirabilis, and ps. aeruginosa, all obtained from diabetic foot ulcers. these tested bacteria were resistant for at least 10 antibiotics commonly used for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. compounds 7 and 8 had considerable activity against ps. aeruginosa (mic values 2-8 microg/ml), compound 9 against s. aureus (mic 4-16 microg/ml) and s. pyogenes (mic 2-4 microg/ml), and also 9 and 11 against p. mirabilis (mic 1-16 microg/ml). all complexes were non-toxic for daphnia at concentrations above 512 microg/ml overnight.
in vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of h2 receptor antagonists.
enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme dna gyrase. there are a number of drug interactions reported for enoxacin. on the other hand h2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. as the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. in present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a b.p. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and h2-receptor antagonists alone. the interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. these studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (ph 9) and buffers of ph 7.4 simulating blood ph at 37 degrees c. in order to support these interaction studies, the effect of h2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (mic) of enoxacin was also studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogens, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis. on the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with h2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in mic of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.
a new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
the use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. a marine bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from eal fish of baluchistan coast of pakistan. this strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. in this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of p. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa), salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, vibrio aliginolyticus, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter faecium but it is not active against g streptococci, candida albicans, aspergillus niger. minimal inhibitory concentration for gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg ml(-1) and for gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg ml(-1).
potency and spectrum of garenoxacin tested against an international collection of skin and soft tissue infection pathogens: report from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1999-2004).
the spectrum and potency of garenoxacin, a novel des-f(6)-quinolone, against a large international collection (11723 strains) of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens that cause skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) were evaluated for the years 1999 to 2004. consecutive nonduplicate bacterial isolates were collected from patients with documented community-acquired or nosocomial ssti in >70 medical centers participating in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program in north america (37.4%), europe (26.7%), latin america (16.7%), and the asia-pacific region (19.2%). all isolates were tested using the reference broth microdilution methods against garenoxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and representative comparator agents used for the empiric or directed therapy for ssti. ranking pathogens producing ssti during these years included staphylococcus aureus (42.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.1%), escherichia coli (9.0%), enterococcus spp. (7.3%), klebsiella spp. (4.8%), enterobacter spp. (4.7%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.5%), and acinetobacter spp. (2.1%). garenoxacin was the most potent agent tested against s. aureus and was at least 2-fold more active than gatifloxacin (mic(50), 0.06 mg/l) and 8-fold more active than levofloxacin (mic(50), 0.25 mg/l). furthermore, garenoxacin was 2- to 8-fold more potent than the fluoroquinolones against beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, as well as up to 4-fold more active against enterococci. garenoxacin was largely comparable with the comparator fluoroquinolones against e. coli, klebsiella spp., and acinetobacter spp., but it is less active than these agents against p. aeruginosa. in summary, garenoxacin was documented to be the most potent quinolone when tested against key gram-positive pathogens (s. aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci) and was similar in activity to these agents against other species (enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp.). these in vitro data suggest that garenoxacin warrants further clinical studies in ssti, especially against staphylococci and streptococcal pathogens.
an in vitro assessment of the antibacterial effect of garlic (allium sativum) on  bacterial isolates from wound infections.
background: garlic (allium sativum) has come to be seen as an all rounded treatment for preventing wound infection, common cold, malaria, cough and lung tuberculosis, hypertension, sexually transmitted diseases, mental illness, kidney diseases, liver diseases, asthma, diabetes. objective: the main objective of this study was to assess the antibacterial effect of crude preparation of garlic on bacterial isolates from the wound infections. methods: an experimental study was conducted in gondar university teaching hospital school of medical laboratory technology, microbiology laboratory from june 2004 to april 2005 by agar dilution technique. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of garlic to control strains of staphylococcus aureus attc 25923 and escherichia coli attcc 25922, as well as to clinical isolates of s. aureus, e. coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using agar dilution method the data was collected in triplicate. results: all the tested organisms were inhibited by 33.75 mg/ml of the crude preparation of garlic except control organism and clinical isolates of s. aureus, which were inhibited by 11.25 mg/ml of crude garlic. garlic did not reveal bactericidal effect up to a concentration of 37.5 mg/ml against all the tested organisms. conclusion: crude preparation of garlic could be used as an effective antibacterial agent for the tested organisms. nevertheless, clinical trial on the effect of garlic is essential before advocating large-scale therapy.
antibacterial activity of snake, scorpion and bee venoms: a comparison with purified venom phospholipase a2 enzymes.
aims: venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. methods and results: thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified pla(2)s and two l-amino acid oxidases (laao) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). several snake venoms (daboia russelli russelli, crotalus adamanteus, naja sumatrana, pseudechis guttata, agkistrodon halys, acanthophis praelongus and daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. daboia russelli russelli and pseudechis australis venoms exhibited the most potent activity against staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. the order of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -s. aureus > proteus mirabilis > proteus vulgaris > enterobacter aerogenes > pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against s. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). a stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). the mic were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). conclusion: the present findings indicate that viperidae (d. russelli russelli) and elapidae (p. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the pla(2) enzymes. the results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. significance and impact of the study: the activity of laao and pla(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.

1,2-bis-[2-(5-h/me/cl/no2)-1h-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (l1-l4), 1,4-bis-[2-(5-h/me/cl)-1h-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (l5-l7) and their complexes with zncl2, cdcl2 and hgcl2 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans. hgii complexes have a considerably higher antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms. some hgii complexes show higher antifungal activity than clotrimazole toward c. albicans. zn2(l3)cl4, zn2(l4)cl4, and cd(l3)cl2 were moderately effective against s. aureus and s. epidermidis; cd(l4)cl2 exhibited a weak activity only against s. epidermidis.
antimicrobial activity of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-r)-1h-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2-ethanediols, 1,4-bis-[2-(5-r)-1h-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2,3,4-butanetetraols and their feiii, cuii, and agi complexes.
1,2-bis-[2-(5-h/me/cl/no2)-1h-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (l1-l4), 1,4-bis-[2-(5-h/me/cl)-1h-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (l5-l7) and their complexes with fecl3, cucl2, and agno3 were synthesized; antibacterial activity of the compounds was determined toward staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis, and antifungal activity against candida albicans. the agi complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. some agi complexes show higher activity toward s. epidermidis than agno3 and cefuroxime. cu(l3)cl2 and fe(l3)cl3 show an antifungal effect on c. albicans but l3 itself has no activity.
the anti-microbial activity of electrolysed oxidizing water against microorganisms relevant in veterinary medicine.
standards of the german association of veterinary medicine (dvg) for the evaluation of chemical disinfectants were used to assess the anti-microbial efficacy of electrolysed oxidizing water (eow). enterococcus faecium, mycobacterium avium subspecies avium, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans were exposed to anode eow (ph, 3.0+/-0.1; oxidation-reduction potential (orp), +1100+/-50 mv; free chlorine, 400+/-20 mg/l cl2) and combined eow (7:3 anode:cathode, v/v; ph, 8.3+/-0.1; orp, 930-950 mv; free chlorine, 271+/-20 mg/l cl2). in water of standardized hardness (wsh), all bacterial strains were completely inactivated by a 30 min exposure to maximum 10.0% anode eow (approximately 40.0 mg/l cl2) or 50.0% combined eow (approximately 135.5 mg/l cl2). the sensitivity ranking order for anode eow to the bacterial test strains was p. mirabilis>s. aureus>m. avium ssp. avium>e. faecium>p. aeruginosa. p. mirabilis and s. aureus decreased to undetectable levels after 5 min of exposure to 7.5% anode eow (approximately 30.0 mg/l cl2). candida albicans was completely inactivated by a 5-min exposure to 5.0% anode eow. both, anode and combined eow exhibited no anti-microbial activities in standardized nutrient broth or after addition of 20.0% bovine serum to the wsh. further research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of eow as a disinfectant under operating conditions in animal production facilities.
antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of plagiochasma appendiculatum lehm. et lind.
plagiochasma appendiculatum (aytoniaceae) of the order marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by gaddi tribe in kangra valley for treating skin diseases. in this context, antimicrobical potential of plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. to validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. the plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: micrococcus luteus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi candida albicans and cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus spinulosus, aspergillus terreus and aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and salmonella typhimurium) with an mic of 2.5 microg/disc. the results show that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. the results also indicated that plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (sod) and catalase activity.
in vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide schiff's bases and their cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes.
isonicotinoylhydrazide schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their co (ii), cu (ii), ni (ii) and zn (ii) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glabrata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. the brine shrimp bioassay indicated schiff's bases, l3 and l6 and, their cu (ii) and ni (ii) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (ld50 > 1000).
in vitro efficacy of the successive or staggered use of eardrops.
chronic suppurative otitis media is still a significant health problem. several topical agents such as antibacterials, steroids and acid media eardrops are widely used alone or in combination to control active otorrhea and obtain a dry ear. patients frequently ask if there is any benefit or loss in the effect of these due to their use in a successive or staggered manner. this question led us to design this in vitro study to investigate the effect of the acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate on the antimicrobial effects of some ototopical antibiotics during their successive or staggered usage. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli were used for testing the antimicrobial activities of the selected antibiotic drops. six microliters of acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were used alone or together with 6 microl each of ciprofloxacin hcl, tobramycin and ofloxacin solution. drops were placed on whatman no. 1 paper disks with a diameter of 6 mm, and the disks were placed onto mueller-hinton agar plates on which bacteria had been swabbed over the entire surface. after overnight incubation of the plates at 35 degrees c, the diameters of the inhibition zones were recorded. there was no antibacterial effect in response to either acid solution or dexamethasone used alone. the inhibition zones of the antibiotics did not change with either steroid or acid media solution added onto the antibiotic disks alone or together. acid solution or steroids should be preferred to use in combination with antibacterial otic drugs in in-vivo settings; no negative or positive effects were seen in in-vitro conditions. therefore, prescribed eardrops can be used in a successive or staggered manner without any influence on the treatment results.
in-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
a series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
potency and spectrum of tigecycline tested against an international collection of bacterial pathogens associated with skin and soft tissue infections (2000-2004).
the antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, was evaluated against 5289 bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with skin and soft tissue infections during 2000-2004. strains were submitted from >70 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe, and were tested centrally using reference broth microdilution methods. the top 10 ranking pathogens (95% of total) recovered included staphylococcus aureus (55.2%), enterococcus spp. (9.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%), escherichia coli (5.6%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (5.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.9%), enterobacter spp. (2.8%), klebsiella spp. (2.6%), proteus mirabilis (1.7%), and indole-positive proteae (1.2%). all staphylococci (s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci), enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and e. coli were inhibited by < or =2 microg/ml of tigecycline; in addition, 97% of klebsiella spp., 95% of enterobacter spp., and 97% of acinetobacter spp. were inhibited at this concentration. only p. aeruginosa and all proteae (mic90, 16 microg/ml) displayed elevated mic values to tigecycline. the broad spectrum of activity exhibited by this glycylcycline included tetracycline-resistant organism subsets, as well as oxacillin-resistant s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enteric bacilli strains. tigecycline represents a new choice among broad-spectrum parenteral agents for the common gram-positive and -negative pathogens producing serious infections of skin and soft tissues.
antagonistic activity of a natural fungal population towards pathogenic bacteria. an in vitro study.
in the present work, we performed in vitro testing of 33 species of fungi of the  subdivision deuteromycotina isolated from water and sediment of the kolubara river for antagonistic action towards 11 species of pathogenic bacteria. of gram-negative bacteria, the species most sensitive to metabolic fluid of the fungi were proteus mirabilis, salmonella enteritidis, and shigella sonnei, while the most resistant were klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium. of gram-positive bacteria, the most sensitive species was staphylococcus aureus, while the most resistant was enterococcus faecalis. of the tested fungi, penicillium canescens, p. simplicissimum, p. thomii, aspergillus fumigatus, a. ochraceus, and fusarium culmorum exerted inhibitory action on the greatest number of species of pathogenic bacteria, while verticillium lateritium, v. tenerum, phoma humicola, and botrytis cinerea had an inhibiting effect on the least number of species.
species-dependent premature degradation of absorbable suture materials caused by  infection--impact on the choice of thread in vascular surgery.
background: in case of infection after vascular reconstruction, preference is often given to absorbable suture material with the aim of preventing persistence of infection. we have investigated the functional deficit of absorbable sutures on incubation with various different bacteria. material and methods: four suture materials dexon bicolor, vicryl, maxon and pds ii--were placed in contact with reference bacterial cultures (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeroginosa, e. coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci and proteus mirabilis). the bacteria were incubated for 7 days at 37 degrees c, together with the suture material. a logarithmic phase (group a) and a static phase (group b) were simulated. the linear tensile strength (lts) of the suture material was measured (instron tensiometer). results: in the case of staphylococcus aureus, a significant decrease in lts was established for dexon bicolor (group a: 31%, group b: 22%), and vicryl (53% and 43%), but not for the monofilament threads. with regard to the other bacteria, a considerably more dramatic effect was observed: in both groups the braided sutures had completely disintegrated after 7 days. the monofilament sutures also revealed a significant loss of function (maxon: 88%, pds ii 66%). conclusions: the absorbable sutures revealed a premature, species-dependent loss of function due to the presence of the bacteria. on the basis of our results, the use of absorbable threads for vessel sutures in case of infection cannot be recommended, with the exception of monofilament material in a monocultural staphylococcus aureus infection.
susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
the aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. we created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 january, 1990 through 31 december, 2000). improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. during the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). the mean annual number of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). the 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: escherichia coli (1494), staphylococcus aureus (1240), klebsiella pneumoniae (779), enterococcus spp. (631), pseudomonas aeruginosa (488), streptococcus pneumoniae (447), enterobacter spp. (338), acinetobacter spp. (298), proteus mirabilis (260) and candida spp. (254). no significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations) per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was e. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was candida (1, 0.3). forty percent of organisms (n=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ed), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (icus). trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ed enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the icu isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. the difference in susceptibility between ed and icu isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (p<0.001). a significant decrease in the susceptibility of e coli to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. in k. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of k. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. susceptibility of s. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (p<0.001). marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.
antimicrobial activity of some 2- and 3-pyridinyl-1h-benzimidazoles and their feiii, cuii, znii, and agi complexes.
2-(2-pyridinyl)- (li), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)- (lii), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-(liii), 2-(3-pyridinyl)- (liv), 2-(3-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-1h-benzimidazoles (lv) and their complexes with fe(no3)3, cu(no3)2, zn(no3)2, and agno3 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans. the methyl groups of liii increase the antimicrobial activity. the agi complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. some znii complexes show an antimicrobial effect against s. aureus and s. flexneri, although the ligands themselves have no effect. cuii complexes have a considerable antibacterial effect to s. aureus and s. epidermidis.
in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.
comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
antimicrobial activity of feiii, cuii, agi, znii and hgii complexes of 2-(2-hydroxy-5-bromo/nitro-phenyl)-1h- and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl/chloro/nitro-1h-benzimidazoles.
antimicrobial activity of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-r5-1h-benzimidazoles, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-r5'-phenyl)-1h-benzimidazoles and their feiii, cuii, agi, znii and hgii nitrate complexes was tested toward staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, and proteus mirabilis. antifungal activity was tested against candida albicans. benzimidazole benzene ring substituents increase the antimicrobial activity, phenol ring substituents decrease it. the ligands show an antibacterial effect against only s. aureus whereas agi and hgii complexes of the ligands have a higher activity with respect to the other complexes to all the bacteria. on the other hand, feiii complexes show a considerable activity against s. aureus and s. epidermidis.
chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of lantana  xenica.
the aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. the oil from the aerial parts of lantana xenica mold. (verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the major constituent of the oil was (e)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene d (6.6 %). the antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of l. xenica inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (e)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus showed a lower inhibition. the bacteria micrococcus luteus, klebsiella sp., escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (e)-caryophyllene.
synthesis and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some 2-[[alpha-(4-substituted benzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)- 1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
in this study, a new series of 1-[[alpha-(4-substitutedbenzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were obtained by condensation of 2-[(alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl or alpha-bromopropionyl)amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)1,3,4-oxadiazoles with sodium salts of 4-substituted benzoic acids. structures of the compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral data (uv, ir, 1h nmr, el ms) and elemental analyses. the antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538. staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans atcc 10231 were tested using disk diffusion method. compounds 4a, 4d and 4g were found to be active against s. aureus atcc 6538 (mic, 78, 39 and 78 microg ml(-1), respectively) and compound 4e against s. epidermidis atcc 12228 (mic, 156 microg ml(-1)).
activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
synthesis of mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
5-phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. the structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (ir, 1h-nmr, eims) methods. the antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri and proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against candida albicans atcc 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found to be active against s. aureus atcc 6538 (mic: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/ml respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against s. flexneri (mic: both 312.5 micrograms/ml). the minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(alpha-haloacyl)amino] thiazoles and 5-nonsubstituted/substituted 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones.
4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(chloroacetyl/alpha-chloropropionyl/al pha- bromobutyryl/alpha-chloro-(alpha-phenylacetyl)amino]thiazoles (i-iv) were synthesized by reacting 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-aminothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride, alpha-chloropropionyl chloride, alpha-bromobutyryl bromide and alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl chloride, respectively. furthermore, i-iv were refluxed with ammonium thiocyanate to give 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (v-viii). v was refluxed with various aromatic aldehydes to give 5-arylidene-2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-t hiazolidinones (ix-xiv). the structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, hydrolysis, uv, ir, 1h-nmr and ei mass spectral data. the antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by microbroth dilution technique using mueller-hinton broth and mueller-hinton agar. in this study, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 8739, klebsiella pneumoniae atcc 4352, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 1539, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis and candida albicans atcc 10231 were used as test microorganisms. among the tested compounds, xi and xiv showed activity against s. aureus (mic: 78 micrograms/ml, 1.6 micrograms/ml), whereas compound v had an activity against s. flexneri (mic: 39 micrograms/ml) and compound i against c. albicans (mic: 125 (micrograms/ml). compounds i, iv-xiv were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv using the bactec 460 radiometric system and bactec 12b medium. only compounds i and xiv showed 86% and 67% inhibition in the primary screen.
antimicrobial activity and spectrum of the new glycylcycline, gar-936 tested against 1,203 recent clinical bacterial isolates.
the in vitro activity of gar-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and several other antimicrobial agents. a total of 1,203 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth or agar dilution methods. among the members of the family enterobacteriaceae, gar-936 was generally two- to four-fold more active than minocycline, and two- to 16-fold more active than tetracycline. all enteric bacilli mic90 results were < or = 4 microg/ml; the exception being proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (> or = 8 microg/ml). gar-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with 90% of the penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates inhibited at 0.03 microg/ml, while the same isolates had a mic90 of 8 and > 8 microg/ml for minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. all enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 0.25 microg/ml of gar-936 (mic90, 0.12 or 0.25 microg/ml). although gar-936 (mic50, 0.25 microg/ml) was two-fold less active than minocycline (mic50, 0.12 microg/ml) against oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, all isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. gar-936 demonstrated good activity against nonfermentative bacteria such as acinetobacter spp. (mic90, 2 microg/ml) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 microg/ml), but the compound exhibited only modest activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 8 microg/ml). haemophilus influenzae (mic90, 1-2 microg/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.12 microg/ml), and various neisseria spp. (mic90, 0.12-0.5 microg/ml) were susceptible to gar-936. these results indicate that gar-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, and that several gram-positive and -negative isolates resistant to older tetracyclines and other drug classes remain susceptible to gar-936, the newest glycylcycline candidate for clinical use.
disk diffusion susceptibility test development for the new glycylcycline, gar-936.
the in vitro activity of gar-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and the disk diffusion susceptibility test was assessed. nearly 700 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution and disk diffusion (two disk contents) methods. among the enterobacteriaceae, gar-936 was generally two- to 16-fold more active than other tetracyclines. all enteric bacilli mic90 results were < or = 4 micrograms/ml; the exception being proteus mirabilis and indole-positive proteae (> or = 8 micrograms/ml). gar-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with enterococcus spp. (including vancomycin-resistant isolates) inhibited at 0.25 microgram/ml (gar-936 mic90, 0.12 or 0.25 microgram/ml) and the oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml. gar-936 demonstrated good potency against several non-fermentative bacteria, but possessed limited activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 8 micrograms/ml). in vitro susceptibility test methods were developed (disk diffusion versus reference mic results) and tentative breakpoints were proposed. using susceptibility criteria of either < or = 2 or < or = 4 micrograms/ml, gar-936 in vitro susceptibility tests demonstrated rare significant serious inter-method discords (< or = 1.2%) and an absolute agreement between test results of 92.3 to 96.2%. these results indicate that gar-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important rapidly growing pathogenic bacteria, and that this novel glycylcycline candidate for clinical use should be further developed.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
cyanobacteria--a potential source of new biologically active substances.
hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts of twelve cyanobacterial strains, isolated from fresh and brackish water, and two waterblooms, collected during the summer from the baltic sea, were investigated for their antibiotic activities against seven microorganisms. no inhibitory effects were found against the three gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens and the yeast candida maltosa. of all cyanobacterial samples, extracts from seven species inhibited the growth of at least one of the gram-positive bacteria micrococcus flavus, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis. m. flavus proved to be the most sensitive bacterium in the agar diffusion test system. in particular, the hexane and dichlormethane extracts showed antimicrobial effects. but only one water extract, prepared from material of a natural waterbloom, was found to be active.
aspects of the antimicrobial efficacy of grapefruit seed extract and its relation to preservative substances contained.
the antimicrobial efficacy as well as the content of preservative agents of six commercially available grapefruit seed extracts were examined. five of the six extracts showed a high growth inhibiting activity against the test germs bacillus subtilis sbug 14, micrococcus flavus sbug 16, staphylococcus aureus sbug 11, serratia marcescens sbug 9, escherichia coli sbug 17, proteus mirabilis sbug 47, and candida maltosa sbug 700. in all of the antimicrobial active grapefruit seed extracts, the preservative benzethonium chloride was detected by thin layer chromatography. additionally, three extracts contained the preserving substances triclosan and methyl parabene. in only one of the grapefruit seed extracts tested no preservative agent was found. however, with this extract as well as with several self-made extracts from seed and juiceless pulp of grapefruits (citrus paradisi) no antimicrobial activity could be detected (standard serial broth dilution assay, agar diffusion test). thus, it is concluded that the potent as well as nearly universal antimicrobial activity being attributed to grapefruit seed extract is merely due to the synthetic preservative agents contained within. natural products with antimicrobial activity do not appear to be present.
[in vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
[urinary bacteria in elderly patients with urinary incontinence and low levels of daily activity].
the results of bacteria isolated from the urine of inactive elderly patients with urinary incontinence in 1982, 87, 93 and 95 were compared and the chronological changes of urinary bacteria were analyzed. the following results were obtained: (1) the most common bacteria isolated from the patients in 1995 were d-group enterococcus, followed by providencia rettgeri, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis. it is thought that the main cause of the more frequent isolation of enterococcus is an abuse of cephems and fecal contamination. (2) the most common bacteriaisolated from the patients who were managed with an indwelling urethral catheter were proteus and providencia species, and their incidence tended to decrease from 1982 to 1995. (3) infection with pseudomonas species tended to increase, as did that staphylococcus species, especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and then decreased. based on these findings, it is important to assess and treat dysuria before inserting an indwelling urethral catheter, and to select an antibacterial agent that is effective in elderly patients with urinary incontinence and limited activity.
in vitro evaluation of bo-3482, a novel dithiocarbamate carbapenem with activity  against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
bo-3482, a dithiocarbamate carbapenem, inhibited clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (mrs) at 6.25 microg/ml (mic at which 90% of isolates tested are inhibited [mic90]), while the mic90 of imipenem was > 100 microg/ml. bo-3482 was generally less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, enterococci, and gram-negative bacteria, although bo-3482 showed better activity (mic90) than imipenem against enterococcus faecium, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis, and clostridium difficile. the affinities (50% inhibitory concentrations) of bo-3482 for penicillin-binding protein (pbp) pbp 2' of mrs and pbp 5 of e. faecium (both pbps have low affinities for ordinary beta-lactam antibiotics) were 3.8 and 20 microg/ml, respectively, reflecting the greater activity of bo-3482 against mrs than against e. faecium.

[comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1992). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
susceptibilities of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 11 hospitals during june 1992 to may 1993 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated utis, complicated utis without indwelling catheter, and complicated utis with indwelling catheter. the susceptibilities of e. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated utis to quinolones has decreased. as for s. aureus, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., p. mirabilis and serratia spp., which were detected very few in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. e. coli, all strains were highly susceptibilities to latamoxef and cefozopran. and the susceptibilities of e. coli isolated from uncomplicated utis and complicated utis without indwelling catheter to minocycline has decreased in 1991, but they has been indicated a trend of recovery in 1992. the difference in according uti's classification of the susceptibilities of klebsiella spp. to minocycline in 1991 has not recognized in 1992. and the susceptibilities of klebsiella spp. isolated from complicated utis without indwelling catheter to quinolones has decreased. the susceptibilities of p. aeruginosa isolated from complicated utis to quinolones has been indicated a trend of recovery. these data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
etiology and therapy of chronic suppurative otitis.
infectious diseases of the ear are important in adults due to their incidence and relapses. we carried out a study of aerobic microorganisms on 251 otic exudates from patients diagnosed as having chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma (119), chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma (85) and chronic external otitis (47). the microorganisms predominantly isolated were, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and other enterobacteriaceae. 86% of isolates were monomicrobial and 14% of isolates were polymicrobial. in these latter the predominantly isolated microorganisms were also p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, corynebacterium spp. and proteus mirabilis. p. aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated and showed the highest percentages of resistance against antimicrobial agents tested. p. aeruginosa was most susceptible to ciprofloxacin and imipenem, but much less susceptible to cefotaxime, moxalactam and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. s. aureus was highly sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin and teichoplanin. 100% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin g and ampicillin.
comparative antimicrobial activities of the penem wy-49605 (sun5555) against recent clinical isolates from five u.s. medical centers.
the in vitro activity of wy-49605 (sun5555) (wy) was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against 2,958 consecutive clinical isolates from five medical centers and 402 respiratory pathogens from 18 other facilities. most members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by wy (mic at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited [mic50], < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). mic90s of > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml were observed for enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp., and proteus mirabilis. wy was the most active drug against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml) and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). the four drugs were not active against nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. at 2.0 micrograms/ml, wy inhibited 82% of enterococcus faecalis strains and was equal to or superior to the other drugs against streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis.
evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
the antibacterial activity of minocycline (mino) and that of cefuzonam (czon) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. mino was highly active against methicilli-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, flavobacterium meningosepticum, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, peptostreptococcus spp. and propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia and alcaligenes xylosoxidans. czon was highly active against mssa, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, n. gonorrhoeae, m(b). catarrhalis, h. influenzae, h. pylori, p. mirabilis, peptostreptococcus spp. and p. acnes, but not effective against mrsa. it was minimally active against gram-negative rods (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
antimicrobial activity of bark extracts of bridelia ferruginea (euphorbiaceae).
water and ethanol extracts of bridelia ferruginea were examined for phytochemical and antimicrobial properties. the extracts, which were tested at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, produced in vitro antimicrobial activities in assays against hospital strains of staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, streptococcus lactis, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes and klebsiella sp. the zones of inhibition produced by the extracts in agar diffusion assays against the test micro-organisms ranged from 4 to 20 mm, while the chloramphenicol antibiotic control produced zones that measured 15-36 mm. preliminary phytochemical analysis of the plant extracts showed the presence of phenols and tannins. sesquiterpenes, anthroquinones, and saponins were not detected in the extracts. the gram-negative bacteria appeared to be more susceptible (4-20 mm) to the antimicrobial effect of the extracts than the gram-positive organisms (4-18 mm).
terpenoids from salvia sclarea.
from an acetone extract of the whole plant salvia sclarea, seven known diterpenes, sclareol, manool, salvipisone, ferruginol, microstegiol, candidissiol and 7-oxoroyleanone, and two new ones, 2,3-dehydrosalvipisone and 7-oxoferruginol-18-al, as well as two sesquiterpenes, caryophyllene oxide and spathulenol, alpha-amyrin, beta-sitosterol and the flavonoids apigenin, luteolin, 4'-methylapigenin, 6-hydroxyluteolin-6, 7,3',4'-tetramethyl ether, 6-hydroxy apigenin-7,4'-dimethyl ether were obtained. the diterpenoids and the sesquiterpenoids were tested for antimicrobial activity against standard bacterial strains and a yeast. 2,3-dehydrosalvipisone, sclareol, manool, 7-oxoroyleanone, spathulenol and caryophyllene oxide were found to be active against staphylococcus aureus, the first and third compound against candida albicans and the last compound against proteus mirabilis.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens. fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.
bactericidal properties of crude extracts of mitracarpus villosus.
mature leaves and inflorescence of mitracarpus villosus, collected from niger state, nigeria, were shade dried over a period of 5 days, ground into fine particles in a waring blender and extracted individually with hot distilled water and 95% ethanol. the crude extracts obtained were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activities using agar diffusion and tube dilution techniques. the extracts produced zones of inhibition (8-23 mm) against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus faecalis, while pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteus mirabilis were not inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the effective extracts were in the range 0.06-8.0 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were in the range 0.06-32.0 mg/ml. the ethanolic extracts appeared to exert more inhibitory action against the bacteria than the hot water extracts.
in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.
multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
[in vitro antibacterial activity of isoxazolyl++ naphthoquinones. i].
the in vitro antibacterial activity of 2-hydroxy-n-(3,4-dimethyl-5-isoxazolyl) 1,4 naphthoquinone-4-imine (i) and three of this derivatives against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis y morganella morganii was investigated. from the four naphthoquinone-imine studied, compound i exhibited activity against s. aureus. this effect was observed even in oxygen atmosphere with 5% co2 and in the presence of human albumin. the development of drug-resistant strains by serial passage in media with concentrations lower than the c.i.m. was determined in 31 strains of s. aureus from clinical material and one from collection. no significant differences in c.i.m. were observed.
comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
the in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a c-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. cefquinome inhibited members of the enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, salmonella shigella, proteus mirabilis, morganella, and providencia. although most citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. the majority of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. most enterococci had cefquinome mics of 4-8 micrograms/ml. cefquinome was extremely active against group-a streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with mics less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. it inhibited some enterobacter and citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of klebsiella, branhamella, and pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-5, and tem-9. its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for most species except for enterobacter were within a dilution of mics.
antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.
in vitro activity of the novel cephalosporin gr69153.
the in vitro activity of gr69153 was compared to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and gentamicin against a total of 702 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(8) cfu) were used throughout. gr69153 inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and proteus mirabilis at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and 90% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. citrobacter freundii (mic90 16 mg/l), morganella morganii (mic90 128 mg/l) and enterobacter spp. (mic90 greater than 128 mg/l) were considerably more resistant to gr69153. gr69153 was four-fold more active than ceftazidime against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus but was inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis group.
in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
[antimicrobial activities of gentamicin against fresh clinical isolates].
antimicrobial activities of gentamicin (gm), compared with activities of other aminoglycosides (ags) and beta-lactam antibiotics, were studied against clinical isolates obtained during a period of july-december 1989. 1. gm-resistant strains were noted in 24% of staphylococcus aureus, 12% of enterobacter spp., 24% of serratia marcescens, 7% of morganella morganii and 26% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, but no gm-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris. 2. a majority of gm-resistant strains of s. aureus were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and a large number of gm-resistant strains of enterobacter spp. was also resistant to new quinolones. gm showed, however, strong antimicrobial activities against new quinolones-resistant strains of s. marcescens, m. morganii and p. aeruginosa. 3. among all the isolates tested of s. marcescens, 24% were gm-resistant, 72% were tobramycin (tob)-resistant, 86% were dibekacin (dkb)-resistant and 64% were amikacin (amk)-resistant, hence the incidence of gm-resistant strains was the lowest. this tendency was also observed with p. vulgaris. however, among p. aeruginosa, 26% were gm-resistant, 14% tob-resistant, 18% dkb-resistant and 22% amk-resistant, thus the incidence rate for gm-resistance was somewhat higher. these results suggest that different ags-modification enzymes were produced by various clinical isolates under the present condition. 4. comparing the ratio of gm-resistant strains in the present study with those in 1980 and 1983, the ratio increased among s. aureus, while decreases were observed among enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris and p. aeruginosa, indicating that a unilateral tendency of increases in gm-resistant strains did not exist among clinical isolates over the years.
[bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
in bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpodoxime proxetil  (cpdx-pr, cs-807), the following results were obtained: 1. antibacteriological activity antibacteriological activity of r-3746 (na-salt of cefpodoxime), cefaclor (ccl), cephalexin, cefroxadine (cxd), cefazolin (cez), cephalothin (cet) and amoxicillin (ampc) were studied against clinical isolated bacteria following as: staphylococcus aureus (resistant or sensitive of methicillin), escherichia coli (resistant or sensitive to cez), klebsiella pneumoniae (resistant or sensitive to cez), proteus mirabilis and enterobacter cloacae. antibacterial activities of cxd and cet, however, were not tested against methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or cez resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. r-3746 showed stronger activities than any of the other oral antibiotics against these strains except s. aureus against which it showed slightly less activity than ampc. most frequent mic values of r-3746 to s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis were 1.56, 0.39, less than or equal to 0.10 and less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. against isolated strains of mrsa, mics of r-3746 were higher than 25 micrograms/ml with 23 strains (77%), which were similar to mic values of ccl and ampc against these organisms. mic values of r-3746 against cez resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae were superior to mics of other antibiotics, and the mic50 value was 0.20 micrograms/ml. against many isolated strains of e. cloacae mic values of r-3746 were relatively high ranging 0.78 to greater than 100 micrograms/ml. mic50 of r-3746 against e. cloacae was 12.5 micrograms/ml. 2. absorption and excretion serum concentration and urinary excretion of cpdx (the active form of cpdx-pr) were studied upon single oral administration of cpdx-pr at 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg (dry syrup) or 100 mg (tablet). the peak of serum concentration of cpdx was attained in 1-6 hours 1-4 hours and 2-6 hours after administration of cpdx-pr at the 3 different dosage levels, and they were 0.99-2.99 micrograms/ml, 4.30-7.05 micrograms/ml and 1.65-2.93 micrograms/ml, respectively. at 8 hours after administration, mean concentrations of cpdx for the 3 groups were 0.31, 0.83 and 0.66 micrograms/ml, respectively. as the average auc's for the 3 groups were 8.16, 25.97 and 10.79 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. urinary recovery rates of cpdx for the 3 groups were 20.9-56.2, 28.3-49.7 and 35.1-50.4%, respectively in the first 8 hours after administration.
[antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (cftm) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. antibacterial activities of cftm against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (ccl). 2. activities of cefixime (cfix) were superior to those of cftm against b. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to cftm against s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus. 3. activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of ccl against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and s. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to cftm and cfix against most of gram-negative rods. 4. sultamicillin (sbtpc) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its mics did not exceed the mics of ampicillin by itself. sbtpc showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.
comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
a total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. however, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of s. aureus and s. epidermidis. for escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
[clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
reliability of the cefamandole (cmd) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cmd). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cmd disc tests, which is normally used in japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. the results obtained with the disc method were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cmd disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. in this study, approximately 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by cmd at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to cmd at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. cmd was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. about 90% of staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml cmd of highly methicillin-resistant strains (mic greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of s. aureus were examined. ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to cmd, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
modulation of pulmonary defense mechanisms by acute exposures to nitrogen dioxide.
the effect of acute exposures to no2 on the antibacterial defenses of the murine  lung was assessed following inhalation challenges with staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, and pasteurella pneumotropica. animals were challenged with the bacteria and exposed for 4 hr to increasing concentrations of no2 after which pulmonary bactericidal activity was quantitated. with s. aureus pulmonary antibacterial defenses were suppressed at no2 levels of 4.0 ppm and greater. exposure to 10.0 ppm enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of p. mirabilis which correlated with an increase in the phagocytic cell populations lavaged from the lungs; at 20.0 ppm bactericidal activity against p. mirabilis was impaired. pulmonary antibacterial defenses against p. pneumotropica were impaired at 10.0 ppm which correlated with a decrease in the retrieved phagocytic lung cell population. reversing the order of treatment (ie., no2 exposure prior to bacterial challenge) raised the threshold concentration for no2-induced impairment of intrapulmonary bacterial killing. with s. aureus the effect was not observed at 5.0 ppm but at 10.0 ppm and with p. mirabilis not at 20.0 ppm but at 30.0 ppm intrapulmonary killing was enhanced. exposures up to 20.0 ppm of no2 did not effect the physical translocation mechanisms of the lung as quantitated by declines in pulmonary radiotracer activity following aerogenic challenge with 32p-labeled staphylococci. these studies demonstrate that no2 modulates pulmonary antibacterial defenses and points to the importance of the challenge organism and the exposure protocol in establishing a threshold dose for the adverse effect.
[clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
a comparison of cefonicid with other beta-lactams regarding the effect of human and mouse sera on antibacterial activity.
the effect of the addition of 50% human or mouse serum on the antibacterial activity of cefonicid, three first generation cephalosporins and ampicillin was studied. human serum added to the test system considerably reduced the activity of cefonicid against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains, and to a lesser degree against proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. human serum also reduced, albeit to a lesser extent, the activities of cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin, whereas it increased the activity of cephaloridine. in contrast, mouse serum did not or only insignificantly reduced the activity of cefonicid against some of the bacterial isolates; this is reflected in the excellent protective effect of cefonicid in experimental mouse infections.
sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
[in-vitro activity of cefonicid on hospital bacteria. regression line and proposal for critical values].
antimicrobial activity of cefonicid, a new second generation cephalosporin, against 315 hospital isolates (4th trimester 1984) was investigated. e. coli and proteus mirabilis were the most susceptible species. all e. coli strains except one were inhibited at 8 mg/l (modal mic: 0.5); mics of all indole + proteus were 8 mg/l (modal mic: 0.06). another group was moderately susceptible: mics of klebsiella and citrobacter ranged from 0.12 to 128 mg/l, but mics of 50% of these strains were less than or equal to 4 mg/l; mic was less than or equal to 8 mg/l for 75% of indole + proteus and providencia strains; tested proteus vulgaris were especially resistant (mics greater than 128 mg/l). most enterobacter and serratia strains showed little susceptibility (modal mic for both species greater than or equal to 128 mg/l). mics of all tested pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were greater than 128 mg/l. 20 of the 24 tested acinetobacter strains had a mic of greater than or equal to 128 mg/l. for staphylococcus aureus, 88% of methicillin-sensitive strains were inhibited by concentrations of 2 to 4 mg/l whereas methicillin-resistant strains were resistant to cefonicid (75%: mic greater than 64 mg/l). enterococci were resistant to cefonicid. a correlation curve was established (enterobacteria and staphylococci). on the basis of cefonicid's pharmacokinetic characteristics, critical concentrations are proposed.
comparative activity of ofloxacin and seven other antimicrobials against urea-splitting microorganisms.
urinary tract infections caused by urea-splitting bacteria are severe clinical conditions and very difficult to treat due to their association with calculi, and because such bacteria form ammonium hydroxide raising the urinary ph and thereby creating an unfavourable condition for the action of most antimicrobials. we tested ofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and nitrofurantoin against 143 gram-negative and 99 gram-positive bacteria, all urea-splitting, isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. all drugs were tested using media at two different phs (ph 7.4 and ph 8.5) and two inoculum sizes (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). although ofloxacin and norfloxacin had a similar spectrum of activity, ofloxacin had somewhat greater intrinsic activity against gram-positive organisms. mics of ofloxacin for 90% of proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and the corynebacterium group d2 were greater than or equal to 4 mg/l. the activity of the other drugs varied, but there were many strains resistant to these antimicrobials. the ph and inoculum size did not significantly affect the activity of ofloxacin so that this drug should be useful for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by the commonest urea-splitting bacteria involved in such infections.
[reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. the range of immunological specificity of escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
the antigenic specificity of e. coli m17 peptidoglycans (pg) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with pg opsonized with the whole and exhausted igg fraction of human serum. within the generic taxon, the pg under study were similar in their antigenic properties. the opsonic activity of igg exhausted with the preparations of different e. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. an essential difference of e. coli pg from similar components of other representatives of the family enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. after the removal of antibodies to pg of remote taxons (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). the results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of pg at different taxonomic levels.
aminophylline-induced suppression of pulmonary antibacterial defenses.
respiratory infections are frequently observed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indicating that host defenses are compromised. antibacterial defenses of the lung against such infections include the alveolar macrophage and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) that migrate into the lung to provide auxiliary phagocytic defenses. to test the hypothesis that aminophylline acutely impairs pulmonary antibacterial defenses, mice were challenged by aerosol inhalation with staphylococcus aureus or proteus mirabilis and injected intraperitoneally with aminophylline (20, 40, or 80 mg/kg). pulmonary bactericidal activity and total lavaged lung cell and differential counts were determined 4 h after bacterial challenge. the highest dose of aminophylline suppressed the killing of s. aureus so that 55 +/- 5% of the initial viable bacteria remained as compared with 22 +/- 4% in the control animals. in contrast, there was a dose-related suppression of pulmonary antibacterial defenses against gram-negative bacteria. with doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg, lung defenses were ablated, allowing the proliferation of p. mirabilis to 115 +/- 9% and 253 +/- 9%, respectively, the control value being 26 +/- 3%. the number of pmn obtained by lavage after aerosol challenge with p. mirabilis was also inhibited by aminophylline in a dose-dependent manner. from the lungs of untreated animals 5.0 +/- 0.3 x 10(6) pmn were recovered as compared with 3.3 +/- 0.1 x 10(6), 2.5 +/- 0.2 x 10(6), and 1.8 +/- 0.1 x 10(6), respectively, with increasing doses of aminophylline. the bactericidal activity of lavaged pmn from the lungs of aminophylline-treated rats challenged with the gram-negative bacterium in vivo was significantly depressed when compared with that in control animals.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

sch 34343 is a new penem antibiotic. its in-vitro activity was determined against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. sch 34343 inhibited 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp, citrobacter spp. and shigella spp. at less than 1 mg/1. ninety per cent of strains of enterobacter, morganella and providencia spp. were inhibited by less than 4 mg/1. sch 34343 did not inhibit pseudomonas spp., and it had slightly less activity against enterobacteriaceae than did cefotaxime or latamoxef (moxalactam), but it inhibited organisms resistant to cefoxitin, cefoperazone and piperacillin. sch 34343 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/1, and it inhibited haemolytic streptococci at less than or equal to 0.06 mg/1. sch 34343 inhibited bacteroides fragilis at 0.06 mg/1, including some cefoxitin-resistant isolates. sch 34343 was not hydrolysed by plasmid- or chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, was an excellent inhibitor of richmond-sykes type ia beta-lactamases, and also inhibited, although less effectively, the common plasmid beta-lactamases. it induced beta-lactamases, but inhibited enterobacter and citrobacter spp. in which it induced beta-lactamase activity.
the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome (hr 810), a pyridine cephalosporin agent active against staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new cyclopyridinium cephalosporin, was evaluated against 947 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. cefpirome inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, aeromonas spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp. and haemophilus and neisseria species at less than or equal to 0.4 mg/l. it had activity comparable to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and moxalactam against these species. only a few citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp. and serratia marcescens had mics above 3.1 mg/l. the activity of cefpirome against pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% mic of 12.5 mg/l, was superior to piperacillin, moxalactam, cefotaxime and cefoperazone. the 90% mic against staphylococcus aureus was 0.8 mg/l, but methicillin-resistant staphylococci were not inhibited. cefpirome was not significantly hydrolyzed by most plasmid beta-lactamases (tem, shv-1, pse, oxa) nor by chromosomal enzymes (p99, branhamella catarrhalis, k1). cefpirome did not inhibit chromosomal or plasmid beta-lactamases. mice systemically infected with e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were protected by concentrations of cefpirome ranging from 0.85 mg/kg for k. pneumoniae to 4.467 mg/kg for p. aeruginosa.
dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. the disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the united states were compared. no significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus faecalis for this period; enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. slight increases in susceptibility were observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., shigella sonnei, salmonella typhi, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. the activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against ps. aeruginosa. pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant ps. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant staph. aureus. strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
in vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to that of quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
pefloxacin is a new methyl-4-piperazinyl quinolone. it had mic90 values of less than 0.01 to 0.8 micrograms/ml for the majority of escherichia coli, klebsiella, oxytoca, citrobacter, providencia, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, morganella and proteus mirabilis. it inhibited ampicillin, cephalexin and nalidixic acid resistant isolates of these species. against pseudomonas the pefloxacin mic90 was 3.1 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus aureus had a mic50 of 0.4 micrograms/ml and a mic90 of 0.8 micrograms/ml and s. faecalis had a mic90 of 3.1 micrograms/ml. pefloxacin inhibited salmonella spp., salmonella typhi, shigella spp., yersinia, aeromonas, toxigenic e. coli at concentrations of less than 0.05 to 1.6 micrograms/ml, including ampicillin and trimethoprim resistant strains. there was a minimal difference in mic and mbc values in broth or serum, but major changes in mic and mbc values occurred in acid urine. increase in mic values occurred with repeated transfer in broth or urine.
in vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas sp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. the majority of pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml. haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. although most staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid ph than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. there was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.
pharmacokinetic and microbial susceptibility studies of ceftriaxone.
the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was tested  against 450 strains isolated from blood cultures and compared with that of various other antibiotics. the compound was comparable to cefotaxime for all species tested. it was more potent than cefoperazone, cefamandole and ticarcillin in inhibiting enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp. and serratia marcescens). the mic95 of ceftriaxone for these strains was 0.5 microgram/ml. the drug was less active against staphylococcus aureus than cefamandole, cloxacillin and vancomycin, but most isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftriaxone was comparable in activity to ticarcillin (mic95 = 64 micrograms/ml), and inferior to cefoperazone, ceftazidime and cefsulodine. levels of ceftriaxone in serum and various body fluids were determined by bio-assays. due to its very long half-life (8 h), ceftriaxone serum levels 24 h after i.v. or i.m. injection of 1 and 2 g were still above the mic95 of all strains tested except pseudomonas aeruginosa. levels in bile, synovial and cerebro-spinal fluids were high.
the turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 klett-summerson colorimeter units. the suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees c. turbidities for proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.
antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. in this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (mic) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group a and b streptococci streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens and haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. klebsiella, enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
new broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. iii. synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
the influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (iii) was investigated. introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (iiif--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against proteus mirabilis. displacement of the acetoxy group of iiib with pyridines (iiim--p) enhanced the activity against p. aeruginosa and e. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin iiid having a 3-(1-methyl-1h-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. as a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[d-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code no. sm-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
[laboratory and clinical studies of t-1982 (cefbuperazone in pediatric field].
the authors have carried out the laboratory and clinical studies of t-1982 (cefbuperazone). the results were as follows: the sensitivity was estimated by the plate dilution method on 28 strains of s. aureus 26 strains of e. coli, 27 strains of k. pneumoniae, 25 strains of s. marcescens and 14 strains of proteus sp. isolated from patients. the distribution of susceptibility of s. aureus was 1.25-25 micrograms/ml and the peak of distribution was 12.5 micrograms/ml. the strains of 84.6% of e. coli were inhibited at concentration of less than 0.39 micrograms/ml. the strains of 77.8% of k. pneumoniae were inhibited at concentration of less than 0.2 microgram/ml. the strains of 96% of s. marcescens was inhibited at concentration of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. the distribution of susceptibility of proteus sp. was 0.39-25 micrograms/ml. t-1982 was given to intravenous administration for 5 minutes and drip infusion for 30 minutes a single dose of 20 mg/kg of t-1982 to 2 and 2 children respectively. after intravenous administration of t-1982, the mean serum level was peak 88.4 +/- 8.7 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 52.5 +/- 2.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 4.6 +/- 0.15 micrograms/ml at 6 hours respectively. half-life was 89 minutes. and after drip infusion of t-1982, the mean serum level was 75.5 +/- 3.5 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes and 3.1 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml at 6.5 hours respectively. half-life was 82 minutes. the mean urinary excretion rate was 94.7%, 57.4 +/- 11.0% up to 6 hours after intravenous administration and drip infusion respectively. t-1982 was effective in 13 cases out of 13 cases with bacterial infections. no side effects were observed except for 1 case with elevation of serum got, 1 case with elevation of serum gpt and 2 cases with eosinophilia.
antibacterial activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin in comparison with cefotaxime, lamoxactam, cefoperazone, piperacillin gentamicin.
the in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk 0787), a new stable derivative of thienamycin was compared with that of lamoxactam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, piperacillin and gentamicin against 410 clinical isolates of common bacteria. in comparison with the other agents, mk 0787 was more or equally active against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., and serratia spp. it inhibited all isolates at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l, but was less active than cefotaxime and lamoxactam against proteus mirabilis and less active than cefotaxime, lamoxactam and cefoperazone against beta-lactamase positive haemophilus influenzae. strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to n-formimidoyl thienamycin than to other antibiotics.
antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365).
the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the enterobacteriaceae. the mic(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for s. aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. cefmenoxime was very active against haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis with mic(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., respectively. mics for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. in addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. the combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the enterobacteriaceae and 100% of p. aeruginosa strains tested. development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial mics but more rapid for those with higher initial mics. cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or s. aureus but was less effective against p. aeruginosa.
in vitro comparison of three new cephalosporins: ly-127935, cefotaxime and cefoperazone.
the comparative in vitro activity of three new cephalosporin antibiotics ly-127935 (ly), cefotaxime (ctx) and cefoperazone (cfp) was examined. ly, ctx and cfp had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis while cfp was less inhibitory than ly or ctx against klebsiella spp.; indole + proteus and gentamicin (gm)-susceptible serratia. ly and ctx were effective while cfp was inactive against enterobacter spp. and gm-resistant serratia. cfp was more active than ly or ctx against gm-susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa but was the least active agent against gm-resistant isolates. bacteroides fragilis were more susceptible to ly than ctx or cfp. combination studies against p. aeruginosa with cephalosporin-gm pairs demonstrated synergy.
comparative antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a, a derivative of fortimicin a.
the in vitro antimicrobial activity of o-demethylfortimicin a (odmf), a derivative of fortimicin a, was compared with those of fortimicin a and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. all three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp., and staphylococcus aureus, with odmf most active against proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus, and providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. activity of each of the antibiotics against group d streptococci was poor. the overall activity of odmf was superior to that of fortimicin a for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. both odmf and fortimicin a were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the exception of 3-n-acetyltransferase-i. odmf and fortimicin a showed similar rapid bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin g. the combination of carbenicillin with odmf, fortimicin a, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested. inactivation of odmf and fortimicin a when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. odmf, fortimicin a, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, s. aureus, or p. aeruginosa. gentamicin was the most active, followed by odmf and fortimicin a. the superior in vitro activity of odmf compared with fortimicin a against p. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.
in vitro activity of n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
n-formimidoyl thienamycin (mk0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin g, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. all of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. more than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of n-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of staphylococcus aureus and 80% of s. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by n-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. it inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. n-formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than ticarcillin. all 16 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of n-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. the marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it a promising new antibiotic.
susceptibility of 4410 clinical isolates to doxycycline.
in an 1100-bed hospital where doxycycline has been widely used, the susceptibility to doxycycline of 4410 clinical isolates was examined. ninety-one and 80.8 per cent of the staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae strains, respectively, were susceptible to 1 mg doxycycline/l. seventy-four per cent of the escherichia coli and 81.7 per cent of the klebsiella strains were inhibited by 4 mg/l. the enterobacter and enterococcus strains were less susceptible. nearly all proteus mirabilis isolates were resistant. the results are comparable to those of other studies.
in vitro antibacterial activity of moxalactam, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic.
the antibacterial activity of moxalactam was studied in vitro against 229 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms using the agar dilution technique. mueller-hinton agar was used as growth medium. the results were compared to those obtained with cefamandole. all isolates of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by moxalactam at a concentration of 8 microgram/ml or less. the concentrations of cefamandole with which the same effect was obtained were 0.5 microgram/ml and 2 microgram/ml respectively. moxalactam was highly inhibitory against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and proteus morganii - 90% of the strains were inhibited by 0.125 microgram/ml. moxalactam was highly superior against proteus rettgeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are usually resistant to cefamandole: the mic100 and mic90 were 0.25 microgram/ml and 8 microgram/ml respectively. high sensitivity was found in strains of salmonella species, nine of which were salmonella typhi: the mic90 was < 0.063 microgram/ml versus the eightfold higher concentration of cefamandole. the broad-spectrum activity and unusual mic patterns of moxalactam - eight or manyfold higher concentrations of cefamandole were needed to inhibit 90% of most gram-negative strains studied - make moxalactam an unusual and promising antibiotic.
in vitro investigations with fosfomycin on mueller-hinton agar with and without glucose-6-phosphate.
determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration of fosfomycin in the agar dilution test on mueller-hinton agar showed that the addition of glucose-6-phosphate to the nutrient medium potentiates the action of fosfomycin against escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter and staphylococcus aureus, sometimes by as much as 256-fold. such a potentiation of action was not detectable with serratia marcescens, the individual proteus species, pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococci. fosfomycin is very effective against most medically important bacterial species on mueller-hinton agar containing 25 micrograms/ml glucose-6-phosphate. over 90% of the cultures of e. coli, citrobacter, enterobacter, s. marcescens,proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and enterococci examined were inhibited by less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml fosfomycin.
in vitro activity of hr 756, a new cephalosporin compound.
the in vitro activity of hr 756, a new cephalosporin, has been determined against recent clinical isolates and compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the geometric means of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) for different isolates of escherichia coli (100 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (84), pseudomonas aeruginosa (121), proteus mirabilis (52), indole-positive proteus species (9), salmonella species (19), staphylococcus aureus penicillin-sensitive (29) and penicillin-resistant (39) were: 0.095, 0.124, 11.1, 0.095, 0.0107, 0.078, 1 and 0.95 mcg/ml, respectively. its activity was affected by rise in inoculum against s. aureus and p. aeruginosa but not against k. pneumoniae and e. coli. bactericidal activity was determined by membrane filtration method. hr 756 was found to be bactericidal to e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and proteus species. although the mics of the tested s. aureus strains were 1 mcg/ml, 5 mcg/ml of hr 756 failed to kill 99% of the inoculum within 24 hours.
clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from streptomyces clavuligerus.
a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor has been isolated from streptomyces clavuligerus atcc 27064 and given the name clavulanic acid. conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. this compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. the cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae p99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of e. coli are less well inhibited. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, k. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and e. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.
in vitro activity of netilmicin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
the in vitro activity of netilmicin (sch 20569), a new semisynthetic derivative of gentamicin, was compared with that of gentamicin and amikacin. one hundred and ninety-two clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were tested using both agar and broth dilution techniques. netilmicin was comparable to gentamicin, with the following exceptions: (i) for serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa, gentamicin was more active than netilmicin; (ii) all strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, and citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to gentamicin, were susceptible to netilmicin; (iii) some strains of s. marcescens, indole-positive proteus, and providencia, which were resistant to gentamicin, were susceptible to netilmicin. netilmicin was more active than amikacin for all enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus and equal to amikacin in activity against gentamicin-susceptible strains of p. aeruginosa. all strains of p. aeruginosa, resistant to gentamicin, were also resistant to netilmicin but were susceptible to amikacin. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) obtained with broth and agar showed no significant differences except for p. mirabilis, where broth mics were twofold greater than agar mics, and for p. aeruginosa, where agar mics were twofold higher than broth mics. the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) was either identical to or within one twofold dilution of the mic for the strains tested. a 100-fold increase in inoculum size produced less increase in mic and mbc with netilmicin than with gentamicin or amikacin.
in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics in patients of cefamandole, a new cephalsoporin antibiotic.
cefamandole nafate, a new cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro against 231 recent clinical isolates and in 12 patients. cefamandole had activity equivalent to cefazolin against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae. cefamandole was more active than cephalothin or cefazolin against proteus mirabilis. both cefamandole and cefazolin were as active as cephalothin against s. aureus, were slightly more active against k. pneumoniae, and were considerably more active against e. coli. all strains of indole-positive proteus sp. were inhibited by 6.3 mug of cefamandole per ml but only 20% were inhibited by 25 mug of cefazolin or cephalothin per ml. eighty-eight percent of enterobacter sp. was inhibited by 25 mug of cefamandole per ml, but only 20 and 5% were inhibited by the same concentration of cefazolin and cephalothin, respectively. peak levels of cefamandole ranged from 6.0 to 110 mug/ml in serum and levels ranged from 440 to 16,800 mug/ml in a 4- to 6-h collection of urine after a 500-mg or 1-g intramuscular dose (6.1 to 17.3 mg/kg) in patients with endogenous creatinine clearances of >/=31 ml/min. these levels were done after the first dose, at mid-therapy, and at the end of therapy. there was no evidence of accumulation with the 500-mg or 1-g dose given every 4 to 6 h. the percentage of the dose excreted in the urine within the first 4 to 6 h after administration of cefamandole was >/=43%. the half-life of cefamandole in serum was 49 to 126 min.
the varying sensitivity to antibacterial agents of micro-organisms in pure vs. mixed cultures.
in this study the disc sensitivities of five organisms growing in pure cultures (staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans) were first determined against each of seven antibacterial agents (penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, silver nitrate, sulfamylon, and betadine). then the sensitivity of each organism growing in combination with one of the others (10 combinations) was tested against each of the same antibacterials. significantly increased and decreased sensitivities were found in 30 percent of the cultures with decreases largely predominating. total obliteration of all sensitivity occurred 10 percent of the time. the changes in sensitivity were not distributed randomly but rather were associated more with particular agents and organisms. sulfamylon, was associated with decreases 70 percent of the time with sensitivity obliteration in 50 percent of the tests. streptococcus led all the organisms, being associated with decreases in half of the tests. it is possible that mixed-culture sensitivities could provide the most valid information when mixed infections exist, since they more closely simulate the real clinical situation. therefore it is suggested that both mixed and pure culture sensitivity testing be done for all mixed infections.
evaluation of antibacterial activities of cephalosporin antibiotics: cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cephalexin.
the antibacterial activities of 4 cephalosporin antibiotics, cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin, against 330 isolates of bacteria from patients at national taiwan university hospital, were determined by an agar plate dilution technique. cephalosporins possess strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria except enterococci. staphylococcus aureus is the most susceptible among the organisms tested. more than 90% of staphylococcus aureus strains are suppressed by cefazolin, cephaloridine and cephalothin at the concentrations of 3.13 mug/ml or less, except that 49.1% are suppressed by cephalexin. the relative potency of cephalosporins against staphylococcus aureus in decreasing order is cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. the gram-negative bacilli, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis are less susceptible to cephalosporins than the gram-positive cocci. among the cephalosporins, cefazolin is the most active against the gram-negative pathogens tested. the relative potency of antibacterial activity of cephalosporins against e. coli in decreasing order is cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cephalothin. one hour after the intramuscular injection of 500 mg of cefazolin, the maximum concentration of 33.3 mug/ml is reached in the serum. the sufficient high levels are sustained for 8 hours. very high concentrations of cefazolin are also found in the urine.
in vitro studies with cefazolin.
susceptibilities of 259 isolates of pathogenic bacteria to cefazolin were measured by broth and agar dilution procedures. beta-hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 0.25 mug/ml, whereas staphylococcus aureus and alphahemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 2.0 mug/ml. enterococci were resistant to less than 32 mug/ml. wide variation was seen with gram-negative species. most isolates of klebsiella species and proteus mirabilis were inhibited by 4.0 or 8.0 mug/ml. escherichia coli were less susceptible, and most isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia species, and enterobacter species were resistant to 128 mug/ml.
treatment of pneumonia and other serious bacterial infections with cephapirin.
nineteen patients with pneumonia due to streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus  aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, or escherichia coli were treated with 4 to 18 g of cephapirin daily. there were three treatment failures. one patient each with pneumonia due to e. coli or s. pneumoniae died despite apparent eradication of the pathogen. lobar pneumonia due to k. pneumoniae progressed during therapy in a third patient to lung gangrene, necessitating pneumonectomy. five additional patients with pneumococcal pericarditis or septic bursitis, empyema, cannula-associated bacteremia, and thoractomy wound infection due to s. aureus were cured. all isolates of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and group a streptococcus were inhibited by 0.8 mug of cephapirin per ml; minimal inhibitory concentrations of cephalothin were similar. ninety percent of k. pneumoniae, 85% of proteus mirabilis, 73% of e. coli, and 30% of enterobacter were inhibited by 12.5 mug cephapirin per ml. all isolates of pseudomonas, serratia and indole-positive proteus had a cephapirin minimal inhibitory concentration of [formula: see text] 100 mug/mg. serum concentrations after intravenous and intramuscular injection were similar to those reported for cephalothin. the intramuscular injections were moderately painful, and intravenous infusions caused phlebitis in three of nine patients treated with doses up to 18 g per day. cephapirin appears comparable to cephalothin in vitro and is an effective agent in treatment of infection due to s. aureus and s. pneumoniae.
cefamandole, a cephalosporin antibiotic with an unusually wide spectrum of activity.
the in vitro activity of cefamandole, 7-d-mandelamido-3-(1 methyl-1h-tetrazol-5 yethiomethyl)-3-cephem-4 carboxylic acid, was investigated. the majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. activity against staphylococcus aureus was below that of cephalothin, but most strains were inhibited by 0.4 mug/ml. enterococci were not inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. cefamandole was very active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae, with 70% of escherichia coli, 86% of klebsiella pneumoniae, and 88% of proteus mirabilis inhibited by 1.6 mug/ml. a number of enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens strains were inhibited by less than 25 mug/ml. pseudomonas species were resistant. cefamandole was more active than cephalothin, cephaloridine, or cephalexin against members of the enterobacteriaceae. inoculum size and type of medium had variable effects on the minimal inhibitory concentration, depending upon the particular strain tested. strains of enterobacter, serratia, indole-positive proteus species showed the greatest inoculum effect. similarly, these species showed a several-fold difference of bactericidal and inhibitory levels. resistance of cefamandole to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamase played a partial role in its activity, but some strains that hydrolyzed the agent were susceptible.
in vitro evaluation of tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic.
one hundred fifty-two strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella-enterobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 mug of tobramycin/ml in a broth-dilution method and showed zones of inhibition of 16 mm or more around a 10-mug tobramycin disc in the kirby-bauer method. tobramycin was most active against s. aureus, 100% of strains being inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. all strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and indole-positive proteus species, and 80% of enterobacter species were inhibited by 0.8 mug of tobramycin/ml, whereas only 48% of p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by this concentration. tobramycin was approximately twice as active as gentamicin against s. aureus, four times as active against p. aeruginosa, slightly more active against e. coli and enterobacter species, equally active against p. mirabilis, and slightly less active against k. pneumoniae. the minimal bactericidal concentrations of tobramycin and gentamicin were the same as or twice the minimal inhibitory concentrations for all strains except those of p. aeruginosa, against which greater concentrations of both gentamicin and tobramycin were required for bactericidal activity. tobramycin sterilized cultures of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa, but the rate of bactericidal action was faster with a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin than with either antibiotic alone in the same concentrations. tobramycin retained potency in the presence of 200 to 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml for at least 6 hr of incubation at 37 c, but lost potency in the presence of 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml by 24 hr of incubation and in the presence of 800 mug/ml by 2 hr of incubation.
evaluation of a new cephalosporin antibiotic, cephapirin.
cephapirin sodium, a parenterally administered derivative of cephalosporanic acid, was tested in vitro against 150 stock cultures of enterobacteriaceae and 30 stock cultures each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. both broth- and agar-dilution techniques were employed with two sizes of inocula of organisms. at a concentration of 7.5 mug or less/ml, cephapirin inhibited and killed 100% of strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis and more than 80% of klebsiella species when tested against an inoculum of 10(5) bacterial cells/ml. however, even at 100 mug/ml, only a few isolates of other enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas were inhibited. a 100-fold increase in the inoculum resulted in decreased susceptibility of organisms. all penicillin-susceptible as well as penicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates were inhibited and killed by 5 mug or less of cephapirin/ml when tested with an inoculum of either 10(4) or 10(6) organisms/ml. the drug also was studied in various doses in the treatment of 77 patients with diverse infections. cephapirin was effective in the treatment of 27 of 32 patients with pulmonary infection, as well as in 6 of 7 patients with staphylococcal or streptococcal soft tissue infection. of 25 patients with urinary-tract infections, 19 developed a negative culture during therapy. a single 4-g intramuscular dose of cephapirin was effective in only 2 of 11 patients with gonococcal urethritis or endocervicitis. two patients with gonococcal urethritis treated with multiple injections were cured. the drug was well tolerated except for pain at the site of injection in 14 patients and phlebitis in 4 patients. no abnormalities in renal or hepatic function could be attributed to cephapirin. in addition, no abnormalities were found in the renal tubules of rabbits challenged with 500 mg of cephapirin/kg. if further studies document that cephapirin is well tolerated by the parenteral route, it may have advantages over cephalothin or cephaloridine.
clinical and in vitro evaluation of cephapirin, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
cephapirin sodium, a cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro and in 27 patients. cephapirin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against 25 strains each of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and staphylococcus aureus; 10 strains each of diplococcus pneumoniae, pseudomonas species, and enterobacter species; and 8 strains of proteus species other than p. mirabilis. all strains of s. aureus and d. pneumoniae and most strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and proteus species were inhibited by concentrations of cephapirin achieved in the serum. of 27 patients (20 with pneumonia, 2 with s. aureus empyema, and 5 with miscellaneous infections), 25 responded to cephapirin therapy. the only major toxicity thought to be drug-related occurred in a patient who developed reversible bone marrow depression with leukopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. although cephapirin was painful on intramuscular injection, phlebitis and pain were absent in patients treated intravenously. in a controlled comparison of intravenously administered cephalothin and cephapirin in four additional patients, the latter caused much less pain than the former and caused no phlebitis.
in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephalexin, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin c antibiotic.
concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. the in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. all strains of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. of the staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all s. aureus, 80% of escherichia coli, 72% of klebsiella-aerobacter, and 56% of proteus mirabilis strains. about 90 to 96% of e. coli, klebsiella aerobacter, and p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. pseudomonas and indole-positive proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. a peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. a mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. food did not interfere with absorption. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. over 90% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 6 hr. the mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group a streptococci, d. pneumoniae, and s. aureus, 85% of e. coli, and about 40 to 75% of klebsiella-aerobacter and p. mirabilis strains. levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of e. coli, and p. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of klebsiella-aerobacter strains.
in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. the in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. all strains of group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes) and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. eighty per cent of the staphylococcus aureus strains and about 50% of the escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis strains were inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. klebsiella-aerobacter species were more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. when single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. a full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. the peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group a streptococci and d. pneumoniae. many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. mirabilis. urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the e. coli and p. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of klebsiella-aerobacter.
