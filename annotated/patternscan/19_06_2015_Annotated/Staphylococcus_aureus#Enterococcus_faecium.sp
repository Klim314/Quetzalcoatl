TI  == antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial activities of a bodipy-based photosensitizer.
AB  == antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (apdi) employing the bodipy-based photosensitizer 2,6-diiodo-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-(n-methyl-4-pyridyl)-4,4'-difluoro-boradiazainda cene (dimpy-bodipy) was explored in an in vitro assay against six species of bacteria (eight total strains), three species of yeast, and three viruses as a complementary approach to their current drug-based or non-existent treatments. our best results achieved a noteworthy 5-6 log unit reduction in cfu at 0.1 mum for staphylococcus aureus (atcc-2913), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (atcc-44), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (atcc-2320), a 4-5 log unit reduction for acinetobacter baumannii atcc-19606 (0.25 mum), multidrug resistant  a. baumannii atcc-1605 (0.1 mum), pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc-97 (0.5 mum), and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc-2146 (1 mum), and a 3 log unit reduction for mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 (atcc-700084). a 5 log unit reduction in cfu was observed for candida albicans atcc-90028 (1 mum) and cryptococcus neoformans atcc-64538 (0.5 mum), and a 3 log unit reduction was noted for candida glabrata atcc-15545 (1 mum). infectivity was reduced by 6 log units in dengue 1 (0.1 mum), by 5 log units (0.5 mum) in vesicular stomatitis virus, and by 2 log units (5 mum) in human adenovirus-5. overall, the results demonstrate that dimpy-bodipy exhibits antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal photodynamic inactivation at nanomolar concentrations and short illumination times.

TI  == telavancin activity tested against gram-positive clinical isolates from european, russian and israeli hospitals (2011-2013) using a revised broth microdilution testing method: redefining the baseline activity of telavancin.
AB  == objectives: to reassess the activity of telavancin when tested against gram-positive clinical pathogens recovered from hospitalized patients in european and adjacent regions using a revised broth microdilution method. methods: 11 601  consecutive, non-duplicate isolates originating from 36 institutions among 18 countries recovered between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility using a  revised broth microdilution method for telavancin. interpretive telavancin breakpoints appropriate for the method were those recently approved by the fda and eucast, as available. results: telavancin (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) was equally potent against methicillin-susceptible ((mssa) and methicillin-resistant (mrsa) staphylococcus aureus. all enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to telavancin (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mg/l) and inhibited at the susceptibility breakpoint (i.e. </= 0.25 mg/l), except for vana-phenotype vancomycin-resistant isolates (telavancin mic, >1 mg/l). telavancin ( </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l) was active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium,  while higher mic values were obtained for vana strains. telavancin (both mic50 and mic90, </= 0.015 mg/l) was potent against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.06 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l). conclusions: telavancin exhibited potent activity against this contemporary (2011-2013) collection of organisms, inhibiting indicated pathogens at or below the fda/eucast-approved breakpoints for susceptibility. vana-phenotype enterococci were less susceptible to telavancin, a feature observed using the previous testing method. these results redefine telavancin's activity against isolates from europe.

TI  == [bloodstream infections in southwestern china: 2012 whire union report on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  == objective: to test the susceptibility of blood culture isolates to antibiotics in a sample of hospitals in southwestern china in 2012. methods: blood culture samples were taken and tested from the patients under the whire union surveillance in three tertiary hospitals in southwestern china in 2012. we performed antimicrobial susceptibility analyses on the blood culture isolates using whonet5. 5 and spss19.0. results: a total of 1745 isolates were identified: 877 gram-positive (50.26%); 868 gram-negative (49.74%). coagulase-negative staphylococcius (cns, 541 strains, 31.00%), escherichia coli (eco, 379 strains, 21.72%), klebsiella spp. (170 strains, 9.74%), enterococcus spp. (143 strains, 8.20%) and staphylococcus aureus (sau, 128 strains, 7.34%) comprised the majority of isolates. methicillin-resistant was found in 37.5% of s. aureus and 85.4% of cns, respectively. zero and 6.3% resistance to vancomycin were found for enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, respectively,compared with a 1.4% and 7.9%  resistance to linezolid, respectively. imipenem-resistance occurred in 0.7% e. coli, 3.6% klebsiella spp., and 11.1% enterobacter spp.. nonfermenters were highly resistant to carbapenems, with an imipenem resistance rate of 25.0% in p.  aeruginosa and 79.1% in acinetobacter baumannii. antimicrobial usage and critical-care units were identified as risk factors for mrsa and multi-drug-resistant a. baumannii infections. patients undergoing tracheotomy/endotracheal intubation were likely to develop multi-drug-resistant a. baumannii infections than others. conclusion: cns, e. coli,klebsiella spp., enterococcus spp. and s. aureus were the predominant organisms in bloodstream infections in southwestern china. low methicillin-resistant rate was found in staphylococcus aureus. but vancomycin-resistant rate was high in e. faecium. imipenem-resistant rates varied in enterobacteriaceae: higher in non-fermenting bacteria especially in acinetobacter spp. use of abtimicrobial drugs and invasive procedures can lead to development of antimicrobial drugs-resistance.

TI  == a novel gene, optra, that confers transferable resistance to oxazolidinones and phenicols and its presence in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium of human and animal origin.
AB  == objectives: the oxazolidinone-resistant enterococcus faecalis e349 from a human patient tested negative for the cfr gene and 23s rrna mutations. here we report the identification of a novel oxazolidinone resistance gene, optra, and a first investigation of the extent to which this gene was present in e. faecalis and enterococcus faecium from humans and food-producing animals. methods: the resistance gene optra was identified by whole-plasmid sequencing and subsequent cloning and expression in a susceptible enterococcus host. transformation and conjugation assays served to investigate the transferability of optra. all optra-positive e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates of human and animal origin were analysed for their mics and their genotype, as well as the location of optra. results: the novel plasmid-borne abc transporter gene optra from e. faecalis e349 conferred combined resistance or elevated mics (when no clinical breakpoints were available) to oxazolidinones (linezolid and tedizolid) and phenicols (chloramphenicol and florfenicol). the corresponding conjugative plasmid pe349, on which optra was located, had a size of 36 331 bp and also carried the phenicol exporter gene fexa. the optra gene was functionally expressed in e. faecalis, e. faecium and staphylococcus aureus. it was detected more frequently in e. faecalis and e. faecium from food-producing animals (20.3%  and 5.7%, respectively) than from humans (4.2% and 0.6%, respectively). conclusions: enterococci with elevated mics of linezolid and tedizolid should be  tested not only for 23s rrna mutations and the gene cfr, but also for the novel resistance gene optra.

TI  == bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) against  the eskape pathogens.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. the 'eskape' pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) have been  highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. the stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. this study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed apntp jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the eskape pathogens. standard plate counts and the xtt metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of apntp, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. apntp exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the eskape pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and  complete eradication of eskape pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of a. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. this demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == repurposing non-antimicrobial drugs and clinical molecules to treat bacterial infections.
AB  == there is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. the objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. a library, containing 727 fda approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobactercloacae). drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. the initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolates. two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against gram-negative pathogens. among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (eb) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (fdurd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable  clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant staphylococcus isolates including mrsa, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa), and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa).the minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of s. aureus were inhibited (mic90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/l  for eb and fdurd, respectively. treatment with eb orally significantly increased  mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic mrsa-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. fdurd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced  mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. these data encourage screening and  repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

TI  == global in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents: tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial 2004-2013.
AB  == background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) is a global  antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study which has been ongoing since 2004. this report examines the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against clinically important pathogens collected globally between 2004 and 2013.  methods: antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. the cochran armitage trend test was used to identify statistically significant changes in susceptibility between 2004 and 2013. results: among the enterobacteriaceae susceptibility was highest to the carbapenems [imipenem 97.1% (24,655/25,381), meropenem 97.0% (90,714/93,518)], tigecycline (97.0%, 115,361/118,899) and amikacin (96.9%, 115,200/118,899). against acinetobacter baumannii the highest rates of susceptibility were for minocycline (84.5%, 14,178/16,778) and imipenem (80.0%, 3,037/3,795). the mic90 for tigecycline was 2 mg/l. 40% (6,743/16,778) of a. baumannii isolates were multidrug-resistant. enterococci were highly susceptible  to tigecycline and linezolid (>99%); vancomycin resistance was observed among 2%  of enterococcus faecalis (325/14,615) and 35% of enterococcus faecium (2,136/6,167) globally. 40% (14,647/36,448) of staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant while 15% (2,152/14,562) of streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-resistant. against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline was >/=99.9%. globally, 81% (331/410) of statistically significant susceptibility changes during the study period were decreases in susceptibility. conclusions: amikacin, the carbapenems, and tigecycline were active against most gram-negative pathogens while linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin retained activity against most gram-positive pathogens collected in test during 2004-2013.

TI  == the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia.
AB  == background/aims: although bacteremias due to the six eskape pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problems in solid organ transplant (sot), no information in liver transplant recipients is available. we sought to investigate the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia. methodology: a retrospective analysis of bacteremia after liver transplantation was reviewed. risk factors for mortality and septic shock caused by eskape bacteremia were identified. results: forty-nine episodes ofbacteremia in 37 liver transplant recipients were due to eskape strains. the only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with eskape was septic shock (odds ratio [or] = 67.500, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 8.464-538.300, p < .001). the factors for septic shock independently associated with eskape were white blood cells count > 15,000/mm3 (or = 15.205, 95% ci = 2.271-101.799, p = .005) and temperature of 39 degrees c or greater (or = 10.959, 95% ci = 1.592-75.450, p = .015). conclusions: to improve the results of liver transplantation, more effectively therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia present with septic shock, elevated white blood cells count and high body temperature.

TI  == repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic):  0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in hampton roads, virginia.
AB  == we studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the hampton roads area, virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated  with eastern virginia medical school. the data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram- positive and e. coli the  most common gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. overall 53% of s.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. there was a broad scatter of mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and mic of 4 mug/ml was reported in 2012. penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of streptococcus pneumoniae. vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of enterococcus faecium and 2%  of enterococcus faecalis respectively. acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant gram negative organism in the data compiled. among the escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( sxt) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. we found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.

TI  == antibiotics in agriculture and the risk to human health: how worried should we be?
AB  == the use of antibiotics in agriculture is routinely described as a major contributor to the clinical problem of resistant disease in human medicine. while a link is plausible, there are no data conclusively showing the magnitude of the  threat emerging from agriculture. here, we define the potential mechanisms by which agricultural antibiotic use could lead to human disease and use case studies to critically assess the potential risk from each. the three mechanisms considered are as follows 1: direct infection with resistant bacteria from an animal source, 2: breaches in the species barrier followed by sustained transmission in humans of resistant strains arising in livestock, and 3: transfer of resistance genes from agriculture into human pathogens. of these, mechanism 1  is the most readily estimated, while significant is small in comparison with the  overall burden of resistant disease. several cases of mechanism 2 are known, and  we discuss the likely livestock origins of resistant clones of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium, but while it is easy to show relatedness the direction of transmission is hard to assess in robust fashion. more difficult yet to study is the contribution of mechanism 3, which may be the most important of all.

TI  == auranofin exerts broad-spectrum bactericidal activities by targeting thiol-redox  homeostasis.
AB  == infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a rising public health threat and make the identification of new antibiotics a priority. from a cell-based screen for bactericidal compounds against mycobacterium tuberculosis under nutrient-deprivation conditions we identified auranofin, an orally bioavailable fda-approved antirheumatic drug, as having potent bactericidal activities against both replicating and nonreplicating m. tuberculosis. we also found that auranofin is active against other gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis and enterococcus faecalis, and drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. our biochemical studies showed that auranofin inhibits the bacterial thioredoxin reductase, a protein essential in many gram-positive bacteria for maintaining the thiol-redox balance and protecting against reactive oxidative species. auranofin  decreases the reducing capacity of target bacteria, thereby sensitizing them to oxidative stress. finally, auranofin was efficacious in a murine model of methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection. these results suggest that the thioredoxin-mediated redox cascade of gram-positive pathogens is a valid target for the development of antibacterial drugs, and that the existing clinical agent  auranofin may be repurposed to aid in the treatment of several important antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

TI  == new antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  == microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging.  in search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. the antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth  of the nosocomial pathogens staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical e. faecalis, e. faecium, and s. aureus isolates. it also strongly reduced the growth of legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of escherichia coli in urine. we postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.

TI  == matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof) directly from positive blood culture flasks allows rapid identification of bloodstream infections in immunosuppressed hosts.
AB  == introduction: in immunosuppressed hosts, rapid identification of microorganisms of bloodstream infections is crucial to ensuring effective antimicrobial therapy. conventional culture requires up to 72 h from sample collection to pathogen identification. methods: we used the sepsityper kit and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof; microflex, bruker) directly from positive blood culture (bact/alert 3d, fn/fa vials; biomerieux) in comparison to standard culture methodology (vitek 2; biomerieux) for species identification. results: a total of 62 consecutive positive blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients (solid organ or hematopoietic transplant  recipients, or with febrile neutropenia) were analyzed. culture yielded gram-negative bacteria (gnb) in 27/62 (43.5%) and gram-positive (gpb) in 35/62 (56.5%) vials. for gnb, the predominant species identified by maldi-tof and confirmed by vitek were escherichia coli (16/16 correctly identified) and enterobacter cloacae (4/4), with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.6% and 100%, respectively. for gpb, predominant species were staphylococcus aureus (3/3), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12/24), and enterococcus faecium (6/6) with a sensitivity of 100%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. the median time from blood collection to species identification was 27.4 h with maldi-tof identification and 46.6 h with conventional methodology. conclusion: using maldi-tof directly from positive blood cultures allowed a shorter time to identification with high sensitivity and specificity in immunosuppressed patients.

TI  == spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == development of novel antibacterial drugs to combat multiple resistant organisms.
AB  == background: infections due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria are increasing both in hospitals and in the community and are characterized by high mortality rates. new molecules are in development to face the need of active compounds toward resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. in particular, the infectious diseases society of america (idsa) has supported the initiative to develop ten new antibacterials within 2020. principal targets are the so-called eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae). purpose: to review the characteristics and the status of development of new antimicrobials including new cephalosporins, carbapenems, beta-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, oxazolidones, glycopeptides, and tetracyclines. conclusions: while numerous new compounds target resistant gram-positive pathogens and have been approved for clinical use, very few new molecules are active against mdr gram-negative pathogens, especially carbapenemase producers. new glycopeptides and oxazolidinones are highly efficient against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and new cephalosporins  and carbapenems also display activity toward mdr gram-positive bacteria. although new cephalosporins and carbapenems have acquired activity against mrsa, they offer few advantages against difficult-to-treat gram-negatives. among agents that are potentially active against mdr gram-negatives are ceftozolane/tazobactam, new carbapenems, the combination of avibactam with ceftazidime, and plazomicin. since a relevant number of promising antibiotics is currently in development, regulatory approvals over the next 5 years are crucial to face the growing threat of multidrug resistance.

AB  == objective: the novel polymeric guanidine akacid plus(r) is a member of the cationic family of disinfectants. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the activity of akacid plus(r) against bacteria which cause nosocomial infections and remain viable after contaminating the environment and determine the effects of organic materials to the activity. methods: closed room and control room were  created for experimental disinfection. bacterial suspensions of 0.5 mcfarland were prepared from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), acinetobacter baumannii and vancomycine-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) strains. a 0.1 ml of each suspension was applied on the chipboard (25 cm(2)) and  tile (25 cm(2)) test surfaces without albumin and with 2% albumin to simulate organic dirt, and the test surfaces were placed in the test and control rooms after drying. before testing, cotton swab premoistened with serum physiologic was used to obtain samples from various surfaces in the environment and the samples were transferred onto 5% sheep blood agar for incubation at 37 degrees c. akacid  plus(r) solution at a concentration of 0.5% was nebulized with an aerosol applicator (prowi-06, germany) for 45 minutes. after a 2-hour waiting period, 1 ml neutralizing broth (dey-engley neutralizing broth, fluka) was transferred on the test surfaces, and samples were collected with a swab from the test surfaces  and various surfaces in the testing room and inoculated on 5% sheep blood agar for incubation at 37oc for 24 hours. at the end of the incubation period, number  of colonies were evaluated on the control and test plates. results: although coagulase-negative staphylococci, bacillus spp., and fungi were grown in cultured samples obtained from the environment of experimental laboratory, no growth was observed in the test plates after room disinfection with akacid plus(r). after room disinfection, mrsa and a. baumannii were not detectable in the cultured media prepared from the test surfaces with or without albumin. the bacterial count for vancomyine-resistant e. faecium was reduced from 10(7) to 5x10(2) on surfaces without albumin and from 10(7) to 2.5x10(3) on surfaces with albumin. all test plates prepared from the surfaces in the control room showed abundant growth of the microorganism. conclusion: the nebulization of akacid plus(r) solution at a concentration of 0.5% proved to be an efficient means of disinfection for the removal of pathogenic microorganisms that cause hospital outbreaks and use of isolation measures.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == microbiological characterization of aquatic microbiomes targeting taxonomical marker genes and antibiotic resistance genes of opportunistic bacteria.
AB  == the dissemination of medically relevant antibiotic resistance genes (args) (blavim-1, vana, ampc, ermb, and meca) and opportunistic bacteria (enterococcus faecium/faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, and cns) was determined in different anthropogenically influenced aquatic habitats in a selected region of germany. over a period of two years, four differently sized wastewater treatment plants (wwtps) with and without clinical influence, three surface waters, four rain overflow basins, and three groundwater sites were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). results were calculated in cell equivalents per 100 ng of total dna extracted from water  samples and per 100 ml sample volume, which seems to underestimate the abundance  of antibiotic resistance and opportunistic bacteria. high abundances of opportunistic bacteria and arg were quantified in clinical wastewaters and influents of the adjacent wwtp. the removal capacities of wwtp were up to 99% for some, but not all investigated bacteria. the abundances of most arg targets were  found to be increased in the bacterial population after conventional wastewater treatment. as a consequence, downstream surface water and also some groundwater compartments displayed high abundances of all four args. it became obvious that the dynamics of the arg differed from the fate of the opportunistic bacteria. this underlines the necessity of an advanced microbial characterization of anthropogenically influenced environments.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 leader surveillance program.
AB  == the 2013 leader surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the united states. a total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. the groups were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. the mic90 value for each of the 6  pathogen groups was 1 mug/ml. susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was  99.83%. only 12 isolates (2 s. aureus, 3 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 streptococcus sanguinis, 5 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). three of these (2 s. aureus and 1 e. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. the findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.

TI  == application of whole-genome sequencing for bacterial strain typing in molecular epidemiology.
AB  == nosocomial infections pose a significant threat to patient health; however, the gold standard laboratory method for determining bacterial relatedness (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge]) remains essentially unchanged 20 years  after its introduction. here, we explored bacterial whole-genome sequencing (wgs) as an alternative approach for molecular strain typing. we compared wgs to pfge for investigating presumptive outbreaks involving three important pathogens: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (n=19), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n=17), and acinetobacter baumannii (n=15). wgs was highly  reproducible (average</=0.39 differences between technical replicates), which enabled a functional, quantitative definition for determining clonality. strain relatedness data determined by pfge and wgs roughly correlated, but the resolution of wgs was superior (p=5.6x10(-8) to 0.016). several discordant results were noted between the methods. a total of 28.9% of isolates which were indistinguishable by pfge were nonclonal by wgs. for a. baumannii, a species known to undergo rapid horizontal gene transfer, 16.2% of isolate pairs considered nonidentical by pfge were clonal by wgs. sequencing whole bacterial genomes with single-nucleotide resolution demonstrates that pfge is prone to false-positive and false-negative results and suggests the need for a new gold standard approach for molecular epidemiological strain typing.

TI  == end group modification: efficient tool for improving activity of antimicrobial peptide analogues towards gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == increased incidence of infections with multidrug-resistant bacterial strains warrants an intensive search for novel potential antimicrobial agents. here, an antimicrobial peptide analogue with a cationic/hydrophobic alternating design displaying only moderate activity against gram-positive pathogens was optimized.  generally, introduction of hydrophobic moieties at the n-terminus resulted in analogues with remarkably increased activity against multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. interestingly, the potency against escherichia coli strains was unaffected, whereas modification with hydrophobic moieties led to increased activity towards the gram-negative acinetobacter baumannii. despite increased cytotoxicity against murine fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the optimized peptide analogues exhibited significantly improved cell selectivity. overall, the most favorable hydrophobic activity-inducing moieties were found to be cyclohexylacetyl and pentafluorophenylacetyl groups, while the presence of a short peg-like chain had no significant effect on activity. introduction of cationic moieties conferred no effect or merely a moderate activity-promoting effect to the analogues.

TI  == update of the telavancin activity in vitro tested against a worldwide collection  of gram-positive clinical isolates (2013), when applying the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  == a revised broth microdilution susceptibility testing method for telavancin was approved by the food and drug administration (fda). telavancin activity was assessed against gram-positive pathogens collected worldwide (2013) using the revised method. a total of 12,346 isolates from 90 sites were included as part of the telavancin international surveillance program for the americas, europe, and asia-pacific. telavancin had mic50 and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml, respectively, against staphylococci, regardless of methicillin susceptibility, and inhibited all staphylococcus aureus at </=0.12 mug/ml (revised fda breakpoint). telavancin was 8-fold more active than daptomycin (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/ml) and 16- to 32-fold more active than vancomycin (mic50/90, 1/1 mug/ml) and linezolid (mic50/90, 1/1 mug/ml) against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. all 692 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by telavancin (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml) at </=0.25 mug/ml (fda breakpoint), except for 1 strain (mic, 0.5 mug/ml). all enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis with telavancin mic values of >/=0.5 and >/=1 mug/ml, respectively, had a vana phenotype. a comparison data analysis based on the mic90 demonstrated that telavancin was at least 8-fold more potent than comparators against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. streptococci showed telavancin mic50 values of </=0.015 mug/ml, except for streptococcus agalactiae (mic50, 0.03 mug/ml). these in vitro results obtained by the recently approved susceptibility testing method establish a new benchmark of telavancin activity worldwide.

TI  == antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
AB  == background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult  patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone  resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.

AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

AB  == elimination of bacteria by ozonation in combination with charcoal or slow sand filtration for advanced sewage treatment to improve the quality of treated sewage and to reduce the potential risk for human health of receiving surface waters was investigated in pilot scale at the sewage treatment plant eriskirch, baden-wuerttemberg/germany. to determine the elimination of sewage bacteria, inflowing and leaving wastewater of different treatment processes was analysed in a culture-based approach for its content of escherichia coli, enterococci and staphylococci and their resistance against selected antibiotics over a period of  17 month. for enterococci, single species and their antibiotic resistances were identified. in comparison to the established flocculation filtration at eriskirch, ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration (pilot-scale) reduced the concentrations of total and antibiotic resistant e. coli, enterococci and staphylococci. however, antibiotic resistant e. coli and staphylococci apparently survived ozone treatment better than antibiotic sensitive strains. neither vancomycin resistant enterococci nor methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) were detected. the decreased percentage of antibiotic resistant enterococci after ozonation may be explained by a different ozone sensitivity of  species: enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, which determined the resistance-level, seemed to be more sensitive for ozone than other enterococcus-species. overall, ozonation followed by charcoal or sand filtration  led to 0.8-1.1 log-units less total and antibiotic resistant e. coli, enterococci and staphylococci, as compared to the respective concentrations in treated sewage by only flocculation filtration. thus, advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration after common sewage treatment is an effective tool for further elimination of microorganisms from sewage before discharge in surface waters.

TI  == synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  == current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. in line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated  for their relative dna binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against gram-positive (including resistant mrsa, mrse, vre strains) and gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. the bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while  compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with mic of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of  staphyloccocus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of  sensitive and resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest dna binding affinity (deltatm of 15.4 degrees c). asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with dna, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial dna binding agents.

TI  == concentration-response studies and modelling of the pharmacodynamics of linezolid: staphylococcus aureus versus enterococcus faecium.
AB  == for assessing antibiotic effects, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) neglects that most antibiotics display different rates of bacterial killing. time-kill curves, on the other hand, provide details on these killing rates but their interpretation is more complex and hardly standardised. the aim of the present study was to develop an analysis method to easily compare the pharmacodynamics of linezolid (lzd) against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium via in vitro time-kill curve experiments and to describe it  by mathematical modelling. the effect of lzd against both organisms was investigated in a static in vitro infection model using 0.5-32.0 mug/ml lzd over  24h. lzd concentrations were quantified by a validated hplc assay. a modified sigmoidal maximum effect (emax) pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) model that accounts for time-dependent effects was developed in 'r'. as a continuous, growth-control-normalised pharmacodynamic measure, the relative bacterial reduction (rbr) was introduced and derived. lzd was more effective against s. aureus than against e. faecium (emax 1.8-fold higher) at a comparable potency (ec50, 3.02 mug/ml vs. 1.80 mug/ml). the time delay of the maximum effect was predominantly observed within 6h of exposure. model evaluation demonstrated its precision, robustness and predictive performance. in conclusion, the presented pk/pd analysis method provides quantitative measures (ec50, emax) for the antibacterial drug effect as easy to interpret as point estimates, but more informative than the mic since time- and concentration-dependent effects were considered. application of the presented model developed as a flexible, robust tool in the free software 'r' appears promising.

TI  == in-vitro screening of malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial  activity of malaysian honey is still limited. in this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of malaysian monofloral honey from koompassia excelsa (becc.) taub (tualang), melaleuca cajuputi powell (gelam) and durio zibethinus murr. (durian). honey samples were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc6518  and atcc25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc12228, enterococcus faecium lmg16192, enterococcus faecalis lmg16216 and atcc29212, escherichia coli atcc25922, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc14028 and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc13883. results: marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas tualang and gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). conclusion: present findings suggested gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested malaysian honey samples.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activity of hyperimmune globulin preparations against multiresistant nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == purpose: we compared different immunoglobulin preparations containing igg (intraglobin/intratect) or a mixture of igg, iga, and igm (pentaglobin) to assess the opsonic and protective efficacy of human immunoglobulin preparations against  multiresistent nosocomial pathogens. materials and methods: clinical isolates of  e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus were tested by opsonophagocytic assay using immunologobulin preparations at dilutions usually obtained in patients. the target antigens of opsonic antibodies were characterized by opsonophagocytic inhibition assays, and the protective efficacy in vivo was tested in a mouse bacteremia model as previously described. results: all strains  were killed to at least 50% by pentaglobin. one p. aeruginosa strain was not efficiently killed by intraglobin (23%) but the other strains were killed by intraglobin to a similar degree compared to pentaglobin. opsonic igg antibodies against e. faecalis were directed against lta, while opsonic antibodies in pentaglobin were primarily directed against other cell wall carbohydrates. in a mouse bacteremia model, pentaglobin was more protective than intratect against staphylococcus aureus, while intratect reduced colony counts better than normal rabbit serum or saline. conclusions: all tested human immunoglobulin preparations contain opsonic and protective antibodies against targets present on multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. enrichment of these preparations with igm increases the protective efficacy against some strains, probably due to antibodies directed against cell wall carbohydrates.

TI  == mechanisms of linezolid resistance in staphylococci and enterococci isolated from two teaching hospitals in shanghai, china.
AB  == background: linezolid is one of the most effective treatments against gram-positive pathogens. however, linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains have recently emerged in worldwide. the purpose of this study was to analyse the prevalence and resistance mechanisms of linezolid-resistant/intermediate staphylococci and enterococci in shanghai, china. results: thirty-two linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains, including 14 staphylococcus capitis, three staphylococcus aureus, 14 enterococcus faecalis and one enterococcus faecium clinical isolates, were collected in this study which displayed linezolid mics of 8 to 512 mug/ml, 8-32 mug/ml, 4-8 mug/ml and 4 mug/ml, respectively. all  linezolid-resistant s. capitis isolates had a novel c2131t mutation and a g2603t  mutation in the 23s rrna region, and some had a c316t (arg106cys) substitution in protein l4 and/or harboured cfr. linezolid-resistant s. aureus isolates carried a c389g (ala130gly) substitution in protein l3, and/or harboured cfr. the cfr gene  was flanked by two copies of the is256-like element, with a downstream orf1 gene. linezolid-resistant/intermediate enterococci lacked major resistance mechanisms.  the semi-quantitative biofilm assay showed that 14 linezolid-resistant e. faecalis isolates produced a larger biofilm than linezolid-susceptible e. faecalis strains. transmission electron microscopy showed the cell walls of linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains were thicker than linezolid-susceptible  strains. conclusion: our data indicated that major resistance mechanisms, such as mutations in 23s rrna and ribosomal proteins l3 and l4, along with cfr acquisition, played an important role in linezolid resistance. secondary resistance mechanisms, such as biofilm formation and cell wall thickness, should  also be taken into account.

TI  == vancomycin revisited - 60 years later.
AB  == vancomycin is one of the older antibiotics that has been now in clinical use close to 60 years. earlier on, vancomycin was associated with many side effects including vestibular and renal, most likely due to impurities contained in early  vancomycin lots. over the years, the impurities have been removed and the compound has now far less vestibular adverse effects, but still possesses renal toxicity if administered at higher doses rendering trough serum levels of >15 mcg/ml or if administered for prolonged periods of time. vancomycin is effective  against most gram-positive cocci and bacilli with the exception of rare organisms as well as enterococci that became vancomycin resistant, mostly enterococcus faecium. the major use of vancomycin today is for infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) and amoxicillin-resistant enterococci. in its oral form, vancomycin is used to treat diarrhea caused by clsotridium difficile.  with s. aureus, there are only a handful of vancomycin-resistant strains. nevertheless, a "vancomycin creep" that is slow upward trending of vancomycin mic from <1 mcg/ml to higher values has been noted in several parts of the world, but not globally, and strains that have mic's of 1.5-2 mcg/ml are associated with high therapeutic failure rates. this phenomenon has also been recently recognized in methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa). while vancomycin is relatively a safe agent adverse events include the "red man" syndrome, allergic reactions, and various bone marrow effects as well as nephrotoxicity. vancomycin has been a very important tool in our therapeutic armamentarium that remained effective for many  years, it is likely remain effective as long as resistance to vancomycin remains  controlled.

TI  == blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in warsaw.
AB  == establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. a total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of  two transplantation wards of a large hospital in warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, bact/alert (biomerieux, france). the 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. the highest proportion were bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with escherichia coli (61 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. the non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). most frequent gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). of 77 staphylococcal strains,  56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 staphylococcus aureus. other gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). among all enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (esbls). resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of s aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples,  2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. both were enterococcus faecium. resistant strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.

TI  == bacteriocin protein bacl1 of enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes l-ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  == bacteriocin 41 (bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, bacl1 and baca. we previously reported that bacl1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kda) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan d-isoglutamyl-l-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of e. faecalis when an accessory factor, baca, is copresent. however,  the target of bacl1 remains unknown. in this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of bacl1. fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that bacl1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target e. faecalis cells. this specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the sh3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of bacl1. repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of bacl1 and baca. the static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting  of bacl1 to the cell division-associated site. furthermore, the targeting of bacl1 was detectable among gram-positive bacteria with an l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including e. faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, or streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus, or listeria monocytogenes. these data suggest that bacl1 specifically targets the l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially  lyses the e. faecalis cells during cell division.

TI  == activity of oritavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in european and us hospitals (2010-13).
AB  == objectives: to assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis) in european and us hospitals. methods: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for sstis were included. isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in europe (israel included) and the usa, respectively, between 2010  and 2013. results: oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal mic, mic50 and mic90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus. cons from the usa (mic50, 0.015 mg/l) demonstrated an mic50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from europe (mic50, 0.03 mg/l). overall, vancomycin-resistant (vana-phenotype) enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin mics  (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (mic50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/l; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all vana e. faecalis at </=0.5  mg/l. equivalent oritavancin mics (mic50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/l) were noted for all vanb and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, while higher mics (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l) were obtained for vana strains. oritavancin had low mics against the overall populations of streptococcus pyogenes (mic50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the streptococcus anginosus group (mic50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher mics for streptococcus dysgalactiae (mic50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/l; >/=98.3% susceptible). conclusions: oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of european and us isolates causing sstis. these results describe oritavancin activity against gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the usa.

TI  == membrane active phenylalanine conjugated lipophilic norspermidine derivatives with selective antibacterial activity.
AB  == natural and synthetic membrane active antibacterial agents offer hope as potential solutions to the problem of bacterial resistance as the membrane-active nature imparts low propensity for the development of resistance. in this report norspermidine based antibacterial molecules were developed that displayed excellent antibacterial activity against various wild-type bacteria (gram-positive and gram-negative) and drug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and beta-lactam-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae). in a novel structure-activity relationship study it has been shown how incorporation of an aromatic amino acid drastically improves selective antibacterial activity. additionally, the effect of stereochemistry on activity, toxicity, and plasma stability has also been studied. these rapidly bactericidal, membrane active antibacterial compounds do not trigger development of resistance in bacteria and  hence bear immense potential as therapeutic agents to tackle multidrug resistant  bacterial infections.

TI  == synthetic teichoic acid conjugate vaccine against nosocomial gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (lta) are amphiphilic polymers that are important constituents of the cell wall of many gram-positive bacteria. the chemical structures of lta vary among organisms, albeit in the majority of gram-positive bacteria the ltas feature a common poly-1,3-(glycerolphosphate) backbone. previously, the specificity of opsonic antibodies for this backbone present in some gram-positive bacteria has been demonstrated, suggesting that this minimal structure may be sufficient for vaccine development. in the present work, we studied a well-defined synthetic lta-fragment, which is able to inhibit opsonic killing of  polyclonal rabbit sera raised against native lta from enterococcus faecalis 12030. this promising compound was conjugated with bsa and used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies. subsequently, the opsonic activity of this serum was tested in an opsonophagocytic assay and specificity was confirmed by an opsonophagocytic inhibition assay. the conjugated lta-fragment was able to induce specific opsonic antibodies that mediate killing of the clinical strains e. faecalis 12030, enterococcus faecium e1162, and community-acquired staphylococcus aureus strain mw2 (usa400). prophylactic immunization with the teichoic acid conjugate and with the rabbit serum raised against this compound was evaluated in active and passive immunization studies in mice, and in an enterococcal endocarditis rat model. in all animal models, a statistically significant reduction of colony counts was observed indicating that the novel synthetic lta-fragment conjugate is a promising vaccine candidate for active or passive immunotherapy against e. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a quinuclidine-based ftsz inhibitor and its synergistic potential with beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant z (ftsz) is an essential cell division protein that cooperates in the formation of the cytokinetic z-ring in most bacteria and has thus been recognized as a promising antimicrobial drug target. we have recently used a structure-based virtual screening approach to identify pyrimidine-linked quinuclidines as a novel class of ftsz inhibitors. in this study, we further investigated the antibacterial properties of one of the most potent compounds (quinuclidine 1) and its synergistic activity with beta-lactam antibiotics. susceptibility results showed that quinuclidine 1 was active against multiple antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium with minimal  inhibitory concentrations of 24 mug ml(-1). when quinuclidine 1 was combined with beta-lactam antibiotics, synergistic antimicrobial activities against antibiotic-resistant strains of s. aureus were found. further in vitro studies suggest that prevention of ftsz protofilament formation by quinuclidine 1 impairs the formation of z-ring, and thus inhibits bacterial division. these findings open a new approach for development of quinuclidine-based ftsz inhibitors into potent antimicrobial agents.

TI  == potential for reduction of streptogramin a resistance revealed by structural analysis of acetyltransferase vata.
AB  == combinations of group a and b streptogramins (i.e., dalfopristin and quinupristin) are "last-resort" antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. resistance to streptogramins has arisen via multiple mechanisms, including the deactivation of  the group a component by the large family of virginiamycin o-acetyltransferase (vat) enzymes. despite the structural elucidation performed for the vatd acetyltransferase, which provided a general molecular framework for activity, a detailed characterization of the essential catalytic and antibiotic substrate-binding determinants in vat enzymes is still lacking. we have determined the crystal structure of s. aureus vata in apo, virginiamycin m1- and  acetyl-coenzyme a (coa)-bound forms and provide an extensive mutagenesis and functional analysis of the structural determinants required for catalysis and streptogramin a recognition. based on an updated genomic survey across the vat enzyme family, we identified key conserved residues critical for vata activity that are not part of the o-acetylation catalytic apparatus. exploiting such constraints of the vat active site may lead to the development of streptogramin a compounds that evade inactivation by vat enzymes while retaining binding to their ribosomal target.

AB  == bacterial antimicrobial resistance is an escalating public health threat, yet the current antimicrobial pipeline remains alarmingly depleted, making the development of new antimicrobials an urgent need. here, we identify a novel, potent, imidazoline antimicrobial compound, ski-356313, with bactericidal activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis and gram-positive cocci, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). ski-356313 is active in murine models of streptococcus pneumoniae and mrsa infection and is potently bactericidal for both replicating and nonreplicating m. tuberculosis. using a combination of genetics,  whole genome sequencing, and a novel target id approach using real time imaging of core macromolecular biosynthesis, we show that ski-356313 inhibits dna replication and displaces the replisome from the bacterial nucleoid. these results identify a new antimicrobial scaffold with a novel mechanism of action and potential therapeutic utility against nonreplicating m. tuberculosis and antibiotic resistant gram-positive cocci.

AB  == background: although bacteremias caused by the 6 eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) have recently been highlighted  as a serious complication in solid organ transplant (sot), more information is urgently needed. we sought to investigate the frequency and clinical outcomes of  eskape bacteremia in sot and determine the risk factors for mortality. methods: a retrospective analysis of bacteremia after sot was reviewed. risk factors for mortality caused by eskape bacteremia were identified. results: eighty-four episodes of bacteremia were caused by eskape strains. of these strains, 41 were caused by resistant eskape (reskape) organisms. the only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with eskape was septic shock (odds ratio [or] = 21.017, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 5.038-87.682, p < 0.001). the factors for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with reskape bacteremia were septic shock (or = 16.558, 95% ci = 6.620-104.668, p = 0.003) and age >/=40 years (or = 7.521, 95% ci = 1.196-47.292, p = 0.031). conclusions: to improve the outcomes of transplantation, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when older sot recipients with bacteremia due to eskape/reskape organisms present with septic shock.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

TI  == bacterial maximum non-inhibitory and minimum inhibitory concentrations of different water activity depressing solutes.
AB  == the nacl mnics (maximum non-inhibitory concentrations) and mics (minimum inhibitory concentrations) for growth of various strains of six bacterial species were determined and then compared with those obtained for seven other solutes. the influence of prior growth conditions on the mnics and mics was also evaluated. no significant changes on the mnics and mics were found among the strains studied within each species. among all factors investigated, only growth  phase -for gram-negatives- and growth at high nacl concentrations led to a change in the nacl mnics. species could be classified depending on its nacl mnics and mics (in decreasing order) as follows: staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli and  salmonella typhimurium. similar results were obtained for kcl, licl, and sodium acetate, but not for the remaining solutes investigated (sucrose, glycerol, mgcl2 and cacl2). results obtained indicate that, in general, gram-negatives showed lower mnics and mics than gram-positives for all the solutes, s. aureus being the most solute tolerant microorganism. when compared on a molar basis, glycerol showed the highest mnics and mics for all the microorganisms -except for s. aureus- and licl the lowest ones. nacl mnics and mics were not significantly different from those of kcl when compared on a molar basis. therefore, the inhibitory action of nacl could not be linked to the specific action of na(+). results also showed that the na(+) tolerance of some species was cl(-) dependent  whereas for others it was not, and that factors others than aw-decrease contribute to the inhibitory action of licl, cacl2 and mgcl2.

TI  == transformation of human cathelicidin ll-37 into selective, stable, and potent antimicrobial compounds.
AB  == this letter reports a family of novel antimicrobial compounds obtained by combining peptide library screening with structure-based design. library screening led to the identification of a human ll-37 peptide resistant to chymotrypsin. this d-amino-acid-containing peptide template was active against escherichia coli but not methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). it possesses a unique nonclassic amphipathic structure with hydrophobic defects. by  repairing the hydrophobic defects, the peptide (17biphe2) gained activity against the eskape pathogens, including enterococcus faecium, s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species. in vitro, 17biphe2 could disrupt bacterial membranes and bind to dna. in vivo, the peptide prevented staphylococcal biofilm formation in a mouse model of  catheter-associated infection. meanwhile, it boosted the innate immune response to further combat the infection. because these peptides are potent, cell-selective, and stable to several proteases, they may be utilized to combat one or more eskape pathogens.

TI  == a broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens. combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature p. aeruginosa biofilms. in addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced p. aeruginosa pa14 preexisting biofilms. pcr studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

AB  == purpose: to identify the spectrum and susceptibility pattern of pathogens responsible for culture-positive endophthalmitis referred to a single institution and investigate possible trends in both pathogens and antibiotic sensitivities over the past 25 years. design: a retrospective, laboratory-based study of consecutive microbiological isolates. participants: a total of 988 consecutive culture-positive endophthalmitis isolates from 911 eyes. methods: all culture-positive endophthalmitis isolates collected from 1987 to 2011 were identified. susceptibility rates to a variety of antibiotics were calculated. chi-square test for trend was used to detect changes in spectrum or susceptibility over time. main outcome measures: microbial spectrum and susceptibility pattern over time. results: a total of 988 isolates were identified from 911 eyes. the average patient age was 67 +/- 18 years, and 55% of the patients were female. the most prevalent pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (39.4%), followed by streptococcus viridans species (12.1%) and staphylococcus aureus (11.1%). gram-negative organisms and fungi accounted for 10.3% and 4.6% of all isolates, respectively. with the exception of 2 isolates, enterococcus faecium and nocardia exalbida, all the other 725 (99.7%) gram-positive bacteria tested were susceptible to vancomycin. of the 94 gram-negative organisms tested against ceftazidime, 2 were of intermediate sensitivity and 6 were resistant. for 8 antibiotics, increasing microbial resistance over time was observed: cefazolin (p = 0.02), cefotetan (p = 0.006), cephalothin (p<0.0001), clindamycin (p = 0.04), erythromycin (p<0.0001), methicillin/oxacillin (p<0.0001), ampicillin (p = 0.01), and ceftriaxone (p = 0.006). for 3 antibiotics, increasing microbial susceptibility was observed: gentamicin (p<0.0001), tobramycin (p = 0.005), and imipenem (p<0.0001). conclusions: coagulase-negative staphylococcus remains the most frequently identified cause of endophthalmitis. vancomycin and ceftazidime seem to be excellent empiric antibiotics for treating endophthalmitis. although a statistically significant trend toward increasing microbial resistance against a  variety of antibiotics, including cephalosporins and methicillin, was observed, a significant trend toward decreasing microbial resistance against aminoglycosides  and imipenem also was detected.

AB  == a total of 300 isolates of enterococcus, from different sources including faeces  of poultry, cow and sheep, raw milk, ricotta cheese and water, in tunisia, were screened for their antibacterial activity. amongst them, 59 bacteriocin-producing strains were detected and identified by molecular methods. genes encoding for enta, entp, entb, entl50a/b, as-48 and bac31 bacteriocins were targeted by pcr. the bacteriocin-producing strains were assigned to the species enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus mundtii and enterococcus durans, respectively, 34, 19, 3, 2 and 1 isolates. antimicrobial activity was specifically observed against different spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms, such as listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii, escherichia coli, ent. faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis and paenibacillus larvae. the inhibitory activity was totally lost after proteinase k treatment, thereby revealing the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound. only three bacteriocin genes, namely entp, enta and entl50a/b were detected in the isolates included in this study. enterocins a and p were the most frequent genes and they were found in 55  (93.2%) and 39 isolates (66.1%), respectively, followed by enterocin l50a/b present in 27 isolates (45.7%). these newly identified bacteriocin-producing enterococci have the potential to be used in bio-preservation of food as well as  biological control of foulbrood disease. significance and impact of the study: enterococci possess interesting properties not only for the food industry, but also for animal and human health. the antimicrobial potential of these bacteria includes principally bacteriocin-like molecules. with the aim of identifying bacteriocinogenic strains, a collection of 300 enterococci isolated from different origins were screened and their spectrum of action, as well as the gene encoding the bacteriocin, was determined. fifty-nine bacteriocin-producing enterococcus showed high activity against listeria monocytogenes and paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of american foulbrood. enterocins a, p  and l50a/b were found in various combinations. the most important finding of this study is the growth inhibition of p. larvae due to bacteriocin-producing enterococcus, which opens up the possibility to use these strains to control the  disease in honeybees.

AB  == bioassay-guided fractionation of the chloroform soluble fraction of stem, leaf, and flower extracts of the american plant ivesia gordonii led to the isolation of a new dimeric acylphloroglucinol, 3,3'-diisobutyryl-2,6'-dimethoxy-4,6,2',4'-tetrahydroxy-5,5'dimethyldiphenyl methane (1), to which we have assigned the trivial name ofivesinol (1), together  with a known monomeric acylphloroglucinol, 1,5-dihydroxy-2-(2'-methylpropionyl)-3-methoxy-6-methylbenzene (2). the structures of the isolated compounds were characterized using 1d- and 2d- nmr spectroscopy, including cosy, hmqc, hmbc, and roesyexperiments, as well as mass spectrometry. ivesinol (1) showed potent activity against staphylococcus aureus (sa) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) with ic50/mic/mbc values of 0.10/1.25/>20 microg/ml and 0.05/0.31/>20 microg/ml, respectively (vs. ic50/mic/mbc 0.13/0.5/1.0 microg/ml and 0.13/0.5/1.0 microg/ml of ciprofloxacin), while the corresponding monomer 2 was found to be less active. compound 1 also demonstrated strong activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) with ic50/mlc/mbc values of 0.22/1.25/>20 microg/ml, whereas the reference  standard ciprofloxacin was found to be inactive against this strain. in addition, compound 2 showed moderate activity against two species of candida and cryptococcus neoformans, while 1 was inactive against these fungi. in order to evaluate the influence of the acyl group(s) in phloroglucinol (3) as a ligand, the mono- (4) and diacetylphloroglucinol (5) were prepared from 3, and evaluated  for their in vitro sa, mrsa, and vre activities; 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (5) showed potent activity, like 1, against sa, mrsa, and vre (atcc 700221) with ic50/mic values of 0.3/2.5, 0.23/2.5, and 0.86/2.5 microg/ml, respectively, while 4 was inactive.

TI  == synthesis, structure-activity relationships, and in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity evaluations of novel pyrazole carboxylic and dicarboxylic acid derivatives.
AB  == a series of pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid and pyrazole-3,4-dicarboxylic acid derivatives were synthesized, the structures were confirmed by their nmr ((1)h and (13)c) and ft-ir spectra, and elemental analyses. the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the compounds against five bacterial and five fungal pathogens were screened using modified agar well diffusion assay. most of the molecules have inhibitory effects on both standard and clinical candida albicans  strains. however, only the molecules 8, 10, 21, and 22 demonstrate some inhibitory effects on candida parapsilosis, candida tropicalis, and candida glabrata strains. the structure-antifungal activity relationships of the compounds on the c. albicans strains were investigated by electron-conformational method. the pharmacophores and antipharmacophores responsible for the inhibition  and non-inhibition of the c. albicans strains were obtained by electronic and geometrical characteristics of the reactive fragments of the molecules. these fragments along with the associated parameters can be used in designing the future more potent antifungal agents. it has been shown that both the positions of electronegative atoms like f and o in the pyrazole substituents and the amount of the associated charges on such atoms are crucial in regulating the strength of antifungal activity for the c. albicans strain.

TI  == daptomycin activity tested against 164457 bacterial isolates from hospitalised patients: summary of 8 years of a worldwide surveillance programme (2005-2012).
AB  == we report the results of 8 years (2005-2012) of the daptomycin surveillance programme worldwide. consecutive non-duplicate bacterial isolates (prevalence design) were collected from patients with documented infections in 410 medical centres and were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods.  a total of 164457 gram-positive isolates were evaluated, including 97542 staphylococcus aureus, 21413 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 29619 enterococci and 15883 beta-haemolytic streptococci. the prevalence of daptomycin-non-susceptible isolates was extremely low for all species in all geographic regions. overall, the highest occurrence of non-susceptible isolates was observed among cons (0.19%), followed by enterococcus faecium (0.18%), s. aureus (0.05%), enterococcus faecalis (0.02%) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (0.00%). moreover, no trend towards increased daptomycin resistance (non-susceptibility) was observed for any species in any geographic region during the study interval. against s. aureus, the daptomycin mic(50/90) was 0.25/0.5 mg/l in all geographic regions (99.95% susceptible overall). only 53 daptomycin-non-susceptible s. aureus isolates were observed and the vast majority (49; 92.5%) had a daptomycin mic value only 1 log(2) dilution above the published susceptible breakpoint. daptomycin was also active against cons (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.81% susceptible), e. faecalis (mic(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.98% susceptible), e. faecium (mic(50/90), 2/4 mg/l; 99.82% susceptible) including vancomycin-non-susceptible isolates (4521 isolates; mic(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 99.76%  susceptible), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), </=0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible). in conclusion, daptomycin has remained very active against indicated species worldwide, and no significant year-to-year or regional variation in daptomycin activity has been detected.

TI  == insufficient discriminatory power of maldi-tof mass spectrometry for typing of enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus isolates.
AB  == maldi-tof mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is increasingly used as a reliable technique for species identification of bacterial pathogens. in this study we investigated the question of whether maldi-tof ms can be used for accurate sub-differentiation of strains and isolates of two important nosocomial pathogens enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. for this purpose, a selection of  112 pre-characterized e. faecium isolates (clonal complexes cc2, cc5, cc9, cc17,  cc22, cc25, cc26, cc92 altogether 52 multilocus sequence types) and 59 diverse s. aureus isolates (mostly methicillin resistant; cc5, cc8, cc22, cc30, cc45, cc398) were studied using a combination of maldi-tof ms and advanced methods of spectral data analysis. the strategy of ms data evaluation included manual peak inspection on the basis of pseudo gel views, unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis and  supervised artificial neural network (ann) analysis. we were capable of differentiating patterns of hospital-associated e. faecium isolates (cc17) from other strains of e. faecium with 87% accuracy, but failed to identify lineage-specific biomarker peaks. for s. aureus pattern analyses we were able to  confirm a number of signals described in previous studies, but often failed to identify biomarkers that would allow a consistent and reliable identification of  phylogenetic lineages, clonal complexes or sequence types. hence, the discriminatory power of maldi-tof ms was found to be insufficient for reliably sub-differentiating e. faecium and s. aureus isolates to the level of distinct clones or clonal complexes, such as assessed by mlst. further, a comparison between peak patterns of susceptible and resistant isolates did not identify statistically relevant marker peaks linked to glycopeptide resistance determinants (vana, vanb) in e. faecium, or the methicillin resistance determinant (meca) in s. aureus.

TI  == haloemodin as novel antibacterial agent inhibiting dna gyrase and bacterial topoisomerase i.
AB  == drug-resistant bacterial infections and lack of available antibacterial agents in clinical practice are becoming serious risks to public health. we synthesized a new class of haloemodins by modifying a traditional chinese medicine component, emodin. the novel haloemodin exerts strong inhibitory activity on bacterial topoisomerase i and dna gyrase, and not on the topoisomerases of human origin. in principle, it shows remarkable antibacterial activities against laboratory and clinically isolated gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. we further  expanded its antibacterial spectrum into against gram-negative bacteria with the  assistance of polymyxin b nonapeptide, which helps haloemodin to penetrate through the bacterial outer membrane. finally, the therapeutic effect of haloemodin in vivo was confirmed in curing s. aureus-induced keratitis on rabbit  model. with distinctive structural difference from the antibiotics we used, the haloemodins are of value as promising antibacterial pharmacophore, especially for combat the infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == daptomycin-loaded polymethylmethacrylate bone cement for joint arthroplasty surgery.
AB  == antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement has been frequently used as an infection prophylaxis or antibiotic-loaded spacer in infected arthroplasty. in addition, daptomycin has been used recently against broad spectrum gram-positive organisms. the goal of this in vitro study is to investigate the bacteriacidal and mechanical properties of daptomycin-incorporated polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) bone cement and evaluate its feasibility for clinical use. daptomycin (0.5, 1, or 2 g) was premixed with 40 g of pmma bone cement powder before curing. the mechanical properties of the daptomycin-loaded acrylic bone cement (dlabc) were estimated following standard guidance, and the release profile and kinetics of daptomycin from pmma were analyzed. the antimicrobial efficacy of dlabc was determined with a zone of inhibition (zoi) assay against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium, respectively. the results showed that the compressive strength, of pmma bone cement, which was higher than 100 mpa in all groups, was sufficient according to  iso 5833 after incorporation of daptomycin. the encapsulated daptomycin was released for 2 weeks with a 9.59 +/- 0.85%, 15.25 +/- 0.69%, and 20.64 +/- 20.33% released percentage on the first day in the low, mid, and high groups, respectively. according to the calculated release kinetics, incorporated daptomycin should be 3.3 times the original dose to double its release. although  all recipes of dlabc had a microbial inhibitory effect, the effect with a higher  encapsulated amount of daptomycin was more significant. therefore, we believe that daptomycin can be locally delivered from pmma bone cement at the surgical site as a prophylactic or treatment for osteomyelitis against gram-positive organisms with intact cement function.

TI  == evaluation of epidemiological cut-off values indicates that biocide resistant subpopulations are uncommon in natural isolates of clinically-relevant microorganisms.
AB  == to date there are no clear criteria to determine whether a microbe is susceptible to biocides or not. as a starting point for distinguishing between wild-type and  resistant organisms, we set out to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) distributions for four common  biocides; triclosan, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite for 3319 clinical isolates, with a particular focus on staphylococcus aureus (n = 1635) and salmonella spp. (n = 901) but also including escherichia coli (n = 368), candida albicans (n = 200), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 60), enterobacter spp. (n = 54), enterococcus faecium (n = 53), and enterococcus faecalis (n = 56). from these data epidemiological cut-off values (ecoffs) are proposed. as would be expected, mbcs were higher than mics for all biocides. in most cases both values  followed a normal distribution. bimodal distributions, indicating the existence of biocide resistant subpopulations were observed for enterobacter chlorhexidine  susceptibility (both mics and mbcs) and the susceptibility to triclosan of enterobacter (mbc), e. coli (mbc and mic) and s. aureus (mbc and mic). there is a concern on the potential selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides. our results indicate however that resistance to biocides and, hence any potential association with antibiotic resistance, is uncommon in natural populations of clinically relevant microorganisms.

TI  == functional motions modulating vana ligand binding unraveled by self-organizing maps.
AB  == the vana d-ala:d-lac ligase is a key enzyme in the emergence of high level resistance to vancomycin in enterococcus species and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. it catalyzes the formation of d-ala-d-lac instead of the vancomycin target, d-ala-d-ala, leading to the production of modified, low vancomycin binding affinity peptidoglycan precursors. therefore, vana appears as  an attractive target for the design of new antibacterials to overcome resistance. the catalytic site of vana is delimited by three domains and closed by an omega-loop upon enzymatic reaction. the aim of the present work was (i) to investigate the conformational transition of vana associated with the opening of  its omega-loop and of a part of its central domain and (ii) to relate this transition with the substrate or product binding propensities. molecular dynamics trajectories of the vana ligase of enterococcus faecium with or without a disulfide bridge distant from the catalytic site revealed differences in the catalytic site conformations with a slight opening. conformations were clustered  with an original machine learning method, based on self-organizing maps (som), which revealed four distinct conformational basins. several ligands related to substrates, intermediates, or products were docked to som representative conformations with the dock 6.5 program. classification of ligand docking poses,  also performed with som, clearly distinguished ligand functional classes: substrates, reaction intermediates, and product. this result illustrates the acuity of the som classification and supports the quality of the dock program poses. the protein-ligand interaction features for the different classes of poses will guide the search and design of novel inhibitors.

TI  == could chloramphenicol be used against eskape pathogens? a review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
AB  == the widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'eskape' (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acintobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. however, it is still widely used in the developing world. in light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against eskape pathogens. susceptibility patterns for gram-positives were good, although less favorable for gram-negatives. however, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found  to have synergistic activity. the risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.

TI  == validation of a novel murine wound model of acinetobacter baumannii infection.
AB  == patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by eskape pathogens, which include a. baumannii (the eskape pathogens are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). as new therapies are being developed to counter a. baumannii infections, animal models are also needed to evaluate potential treatments. here, we present an excisional, murine wound model in which a diminutive inoculum of a clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant a. baumannii isolate can proliferate, form biofilms, and be effectively treated with antibiotics. the model requires a temporary, cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish an infection that can persist. a 6-mm-diameter, full-thickness wound was created in the skin overlying the thoracic spine, and after the wound bed was inoculated, it was covered with a dressing for 7 days. uninoculated control wounds healed within 13  days, whereas infected, placebo-treated wounds remained unclosed beyond 21 days.  treated and untreated wounds were assessed with multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques that included gross pathology, weight loss and recovery, wound closure, bacterial burden, 16s rrna community profiling, histopathology, peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy assessment of biofilms. the range of differences that we are able to identify with these measures in antibiotic- versus placebo-treated animals provides a clear window within which novel antimicrobial therapies can be assessed. the model can be used to evaluate antimicrobials for their ability to reduce specific pathogen loads in wounded tissues and clear biofilms. ultimately, the mouse model approach allows for highly powered studies and serves as an initial multifaceted in vivo assessment prior to testing in larger animals.

TI  == novel method to identify the optimal antimicrobial peptide in a combination matrix, using anoplin as an example.
AB  == microbial resistance is an increasing health concern and a true danger to human well-being. a worldwide search for new compounds is ongoing, and antimicrobial peptides are promising lead candidates for tomorrow's antibiotics. the decapeptide anoplin (gllkriktll-nh2) is an especially interesting candidate because of its small size as well as its antimicrobial and nonhemolytic properties. optimization of the properties of an antimicrobial peptide such as anoplin requires multidimensional searching in a complex chemical space. typically, such optimization is performed by labor-intensive and costly trial-and-error methods. in this study, we show the benefit of fractional factorial design for identification of the optimal antimicrobial peptide in a combination matrix. we synthesized and analyzed a training set of 12 anoplin analogs, representative of 64 analogs in total. using mic, hemolysis, and high-performance liquid chromatography retention time data, we constructed analysis-of-variance models that describe the relationship between these properties and the structural characteristics of the analogs. we show that the mathematical models derived from the training set data can be used to predict the properties of other analogs in the chemical space. hence, this method provides an efficient means of identification of the optimal peptide in the searched chemical space.

TI  == pediatric antimicrobial susceptibility trends across the united states.
AB  == objective: antimicrobial susceptibility patterns across us pediatric healthcare institutions are unknown. a national pooled pediatric antibiogram (1) identifies  nationwide trends in antimicrobial resistance, (2) allows across-hospital benchmarking, and (3) provides guidance for empirical antimicrobial regimens for  institutions unable to generate pediatric antibiograms. methods: in january 2012, a request for submission of pediatric antibiograms between 2005 and 2011 was sent to 233 us hospitals. a summary antibiogram was compiled from participating institutions to generate proportions of antimicrobial susceptibility. temporal and regional comparisons were evaluated using chi(2) tests and logistic regression, respectively. results: of 200 institutions (85%) responding to our survey, 78 (39%) reported generating pediatric antibiograms, and 55 (71%) submitted antibiograms. carbapenems had the highest activity against the majority of gram-negative organisms tested, but no antibiotic had more than 90% activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. approximately 50% of all staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. western hospitals had significantly lower proportions of s. aureus that were methicillin resistant compared with all other  regions tested. overall, 21% of s. aureus isolates had resistance to clindamycin. among enterococcus faecium isolates, the prevalence of susceptibility to ampicillin (25%) and vancomycin (45%) was low but improved over time (p< .01), and 8% of e. faecium isolates were resistant to linezolid. southern hospitals reported significantly higher prevalence of e. faecium with susceptibilities to ampicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid compared with the other 3 regions (p< .01). conclusions: a pooled, pediatric antibiogram can identify nationwide antimicrobial resistance patterns for common pathogens and might serve as a useful tool for benchmarking resistance and informing national prescribing guidelines for children.

TI  == epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant eskape pathogens in cancer patients.
AB  == purpose: infection due to the six eskape pathogens has recently been identified as a serious emerging problem. however, there is still a lack of information on bacteremia caused by these organisms in cancer patients. we aimed to assess the epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant eskape pathogens (reskape) in patients with cancer. methods: all episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized adults with cancer from 2006  to 2011 were analyzed. results: of 1,148 episodes of bacteremia, 392 (34 %) were  caused by eskape pathogens. fifty-four episodes (4.7 %) were due to reskape strains (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium 0, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 13, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (eslb)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae 7, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 4, carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa 18 and derepression chromosomic ss-lactam and esbl-producing enterobacter species 12. risk factors independently associated with reskape bacteremia were comorbidities, prior antibiotic therapy, urinary catheter and urinary tract source. inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was more frequent in patients with reskape bacteremia than in the other cases (55.6 % vs. 21.5 %, p < 0.001). persistence of bacteremia (25 % vs. 9.7 %), septic metastasis (8 % vs. 4 %) and early case-fatality rate (23 % vs. 11 %) were more frequent in patients with reskape bacteremia than in patients with other etiologies (p < 0.05). conclusions: bacteremia due to reskape pathogens in cancer patients occurs mainly among those with comorbidities who have received prior antibiotic therapy and have a urinary tract source. these patients often receive inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy and have a poor outcome.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == in-vitro experimental evaluation of skin-to-surface recovery of four bacterial species by antibacterial and non-antibacterial medical examination gloves.
AB  == background: the number of bacteria recovered from a stainless steel coupon after  touching a pigskin substrate with an examination glove coated on its outside with polyhexanide (phmb), as compared to the number of bacteria recovered in the same  manner with non-coated control gloves was evaluated. methods: suspensions containing 1 x 109 colony-forming units of 4 clinically relevant bacterial species (enterococcus faecium atcc #51559; escherichia coli atcc #25922; klebsiella pneumoniae atcc #4352; and staphylococcus aureus atcc #33591) were used to contaminate gamma-irradiated pigskin substrates. bacterial recoveries from the pigskin substrate, stainless steel coupons, and each glove swatch were performed. a difference in the bacterial recovery from the stainless steel coupons after touching with coated and uncoated control gloves was measured. results: for e. faecium, the coated glove showed a reduction of 4.63 log10 cfu recovery, when compared to control gloves. for e. coli, the coated glove showed 5.48 log10 cfu, for k. pneumoniae 5.03 log10 cfu, and for s. aureus 5.72 log10 cfu recovery, when compared to the non-coated control glove. conclusion: an in-vitro experiment designed to mimic cross-contamination of clinically relevant  bacteria in a simulated healthcare setting following glove contact with a contaminated biological surface and cross-transfer to a stainless steel surface has demonstrated that an examination glove coated on its outside surface with phmb was able to reduce bacterial recovery from a contaminated surface by > 4 log10 cfu, compared to a control non-coated examination glove. these elaborated results may encourage further clinical investigation on the clinical impact of an antibacterial examination glove.

TI  == a current perspective on daptomycin for the clinical microbiologist.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antimicrobial with in vitro bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria that was first approved for clinical use in 2004 in the united states. since this time, significant data have emerged regarding the use of daptomycin for the treatment of serious infections, such as bacteremia and endocarditis, caused by gram-positive pathogens. however, there are also increasing reports of daptomycin nonsusceptibility, in staphylococcus aureus and, in particular, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. such nonsusceptibility is largely in the context of prolonged treatment courses and infections with high bacterial burdens, but it may occur in the absence of prior  daptomycin exposure. nonsusceptibility in both s. aureus and enterococcus is mediated by adaptations to cell wall homeostasis and membrane phospholipid metabolism. this review summarizes the data on daptomycin, including daptomycin's unique mode of action and spectrum of activity and mechanisms for nonsusceptibility in key pathogens, including s. aureus, e. faecium, and e. faecalis. the challenges faced by the clinical laboratory in obtaining accurate susceptibility results and reporting daptomycin mics are also discussed.

AB  == antimicrobial resistance (r) surveillance across asia and especially in china has documented unique patterns and mechanisms. this 2011 study reports results for 2278 isolates from 12 hospitals in china (94-216 strains/site); most from bacteremia (20.4%), pneumonias (29.1%), or skin and skin structure infections (20.9%). samples were tested by reference broth microdilution methods, interpreted by published susceptibility (s) breakpoints. the most common species  were staphylococcus aureus (343, 45.8% mrsa), escherichia coli (ec; 288), pseudomonas aeruginosa (psa; 221), klebsiella spp. (ksp; 208), acinetobacters (acb; 178), enterobacters (155), streptococcus pneumoniae (spn; 154, 46.8% penicillin-s), and enterococci (ent; 137). among 849 gram-positive (gp) cocci, linezolid, tigecycline (tig), daptomycin, and vancomycin provided best antimicrobial coverage (>/=99.7% s). resistance patterns of concern were 0.3% visa, 15.4% teicoplanin non-s coagulase-negative staphylococci, 1.5% vancomycin-r ent (all enterococcus faecium), 1.9% levofloxacin-r beta-haemolytic streptococci, and 35.1 and 12.7% ceftriaxone-non-s rates for spn and viridans group streptococci, respectively. for gram-negative bacilli, r among enterobacteriaceae was highest against beta-lactams (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains at 73.6 and 42.8% in ec and ksp, respectively; carbapenem-r was only 2.1-4.3% with kpc and imp type enzymes detected in ksp). the widest spectrum agents were cefoperazone/sulbactam (79.5-86.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (88.9-92.0%), tig (98.6-100%), amikacin (amk; 91.8-93.7%), and meropenem (95.7-97.1% s). psa was most inhibited by amk (90.5% s) and colistin (col; 99.5%), with cefepime (67.9%) best among the tested beta-lactams. only col (100%  s) and tig (mic90, 2 mug/ml) showed significant potencies against acb. in conclusion, r among pathogens from 12 chinese hospitals illustrates several agents active against gp pathogens, but more serious r problems were noted among  enterobacteriaceae, psa, and acb. combination treatment for the latter multidrug-r strains appears necessary, guided by local antibiograms and national  surveillance results applying reference methods.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of propolis special extract gh 2002 against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates.
AB  == the need to discover and develop alternative therapies to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections is timely. the aim of this study was to  examine the antimicrobial potential of propolis, as a purified and concentrated special extract gh 2002, against clinical isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistent stapylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and candida. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics)  and minimal microbicidial concentrations (mmcs) of propolis against microbial pathogens were evaluated using the broth microdilution method. propolis extract gh 2002 revealed low mics in the range of 0.03 to 2 mg/ml against s. pyogenes, s. aureus, e. faecium and candida. a high bactericidal activity of propolis extract  in the range of 0.06 to 1.0 mg/ml was determined for s. pyogenes and s. aureus, however propolis was not bactericidal against e. faecium. propolis concentrations between 0.6 and 2.4 mg/ml displayed fungicidal activity against different candida species. whereas all tested mrsa strains were highly susceptible against propolis, only minor activity was found against vre strains. time-kill curves demonstrated a high antimicrobial activity at low mics already after few hours of incubation against reference strains, clinical antibiotic-susceptible strains, clinical antifungal susceptible strains as well as all tested clinical mrsa strains, but not against vre strains. in conclusion, clinical drug-sensitive as well as some clinical multidrug-resistant microbial isolates, i.e. mrsa, were susceptible to propolis with different degrees of susceptibility. these results suggest that the special propolis extract gh2002 might be used in the development of alternative products for therapy of microbial infections.

AB  == we present the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of the decapeptide anoplin  and 19 analogs thereof tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus atcc 33591 (mrsa), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (atcc 700221) (vre), and candida albicans (atcc 200955). the anoplin analogs contain substitutions in amino acid positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. we use these peptides to study the effect of altering the charge and hydrophobicity of anoplin on activity against red blood cells and microorganisms. we find that increasing the charge and/or hydrophobicity improves antimicrobial activity and increases hemolytic activity.  for each strain tested, we identify at least six anoplin analogs with an improved therapeutic index compared with anoplin, the only exception being enterococcus faecium, against which only few compounds are more specific than anoplin. both 2nal(6) and cha(6) show improved therapeutic index against all strains tested.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
AB  == there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial  materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential  applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.

TI  == new antibiotics for bad bugs: where are we?
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics is growing up day by day in both community and hospital setting, with a significant impact on the mortality and morbidity rates and the financial burden that is associated. in the last two decades multi  drug resistant microorganisms (both hospital- and community-acquired) challenged  the scientific groups into developing new antimicrobial compounds that can provide safety in use according to the new regulation, good efficacy patterns, and low resistance profile. in this review we made an evaluation of present data  regarding the new classes and the new molecules from already existing classes of  antibiotics and the ongoing trends in antimicrobial development. infectious diseases society of america (idsa) supported a program, called "the '10 x 20' initiative", to develop ten new systemic antibacterial drugs within 2020. the microorganisms mainly involved in the resistance process, so called the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae) were the  main targets. in the era of antimicrobial resistance the new antimicrobial agents like fifth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, beta-lactamases inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, oxazolidones, glycopeptides, and tetracyclines active against gram-positive pathogens, like vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) and mrsa, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin resistant enterococcus (vre) but also against highly resistant gram-negative organisms are more than welcome. of these compounds some are already approved by  official agencies, some are still in study, but the need of new antibiotics still does not cover the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. therefore the management of antimicrobial resistance should also include fostering coordinated actions by all stakeholders, creating policy guidance, support for surveillance and technical assistance.

TI  == daptomycin use in neutropenic patients with documented gram-positive infections.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to describe the outcomes associated with daptomycin treatment of documented gram-positive infections in patients with neutropenia. methods: all patients with neutropenia (</=500 cells/m(3)) and at least one documented gram-positive culture from 2006-2009 were identified from a  retrospective, multicenter, and observational registry (cubicin((r)) outcome registry and experience (core((r)))). investigators assessed patient outcome (cured, improved, failed, nonevaluable) at the end of daptomycin therapy. all patients were included in the safety analysis. results: the efficacy population had 186 patients; 159 (85 %) patients had either cure (n = 108, 58 %) or improved (n = 51, 27 %) as an outcome. success rates (cure plus improved) by the lowest wbc during daptomycin were 98/116 (84 %) for </=100 cells/m(3) and 61/70 (87 %) for 101-499 cells/m(3), p = 0.6. most patients had cancer; 135/186 (73 %) had hematological malignancy; 26/186 (14 %) had solid tumors, and 9 (5 %) had both. one hundred fifty-six (84 %) patients received other antibiotics before daptomycin treatment; 82 % vancomycin, of which 31 % failed vancomycin. the most  common infections were bacteremia (78 %), skin and skin structure infections (8 %), and urinary tract infections/pyelonephritis (6 %). the most common pathogens  were vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (47 %), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20 %), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (19 %). the median (min, max) initial daptomycin dose was 6 mg/kg (3.6, 8.3). the median (min, max) daptomycin duration of therapy was 14 days (1, 86). possibly related adverse events occurred in 12/209 patients (6 %), and 13 patients (6 %) discontinued daptomycin due to adverse event. conclusions: the results suggest that daptomycin appeared useful and well tolerated in neutropenic patients, and the degree of neutropenia did not affect daptomycin success rates. comparative clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.

TI  == one-day point prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in a nationwide sample of 62 german hospitals in 2012 and comparison with the results of the one-day point prevalence of 2010.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. to combat multidrug resistant organisms (mrdos) networks of care providers have been established in all states in germany. the hicare-network, a project to combat mrdos, founded by the federal ministry of education and research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, german-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the german society of hospital hygiene. the aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation  of the situation in 2012. method: the survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in may 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. as in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. based  on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (ha), community-acquired (ca) and lifestock-associated (la) mrsa), vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa/grsa), vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis resp. enterococcus faecium (vr-e. faecalis resp.  vr-e. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (esbl) e. coli (esbl-ec) and klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp), multiresistant acinetobacter spp.  (mab), multiresistant pseudomonas spp. (mrp), carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cre) as well as clostridium difficile (cd) infections and severe infections requiring icu-treatment were included in the survey along with  additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. results: out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). the most frequently reported organisms were mrsa 1.53% [ci95: 1.32-1.75], followed by cdad 1.30% [ci95: 1.11-1.50], esbl-ec 0.97% [ci95: 0.80-1.14], and esbl-kp 0.27% [ci95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. prevalence of mrdos depended on the  level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical  wards compared to surgical wards. all tertiary care providers employed their own  infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. discussion: with more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness  of the problem of antibacterial resistance in germany. the prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. this statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == a multicentre evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of high-dose daptomycin  for the treatment of infective endocarditis.
AB  == objectives: despite significant medical advances, infective endocarditis (ie) remains an infection associated with high morbidity and mortality. the objective  was to assess the safety and efficacy of high-dose daptomycin, defined as >/= 8 mg/kg/day, in patients with confirmed or suspected staphylococcal and/or enterococcal ie. methods: this was a multicentre, retrospective observational study (2005-11). adult patients, not undergoing haemodialysis, with blood cultures positive for staphylococci or enterococci and a definitive or possible diagnosis of ie, who received daptomycin >/= 8 mg/kg/day (based on total body weight) for >/= 72 h were included. results: seventy patients met the inclusion criteria and comprised 33 (47.1%) with right-sided ie (rie), 35 (50%) with left-sided ie (lie) and 2 with both rie and lie. several patients had concomitant sites of infection, with bone/joint infection being most prevalent (12.9%). sixty-five patients received daptomycin as salvage therapy. pathogens were isolated from 64 patients, with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus as the most common organism (84.4%), followed by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (7.8%). the median (iqr) daptomycin dose was 9.8 mg/kg/day (8.2-10.0 mg/kg/day), and was similar in rie and lie patients (9.8 and 9.3 mg/kg/day, respectively). a total of 24 (34.3%) received combination therapy. for those patients with pathogens isolated (n = 64), the organism was eradicated in 57 (89.1%) patients. among 64 clinically evaluable patients, 55 (85.9%) achieved clinical success. no patients required discontinuation of high-dose daptomycin due to creatine phosphokinase elevations. conclusions: patients with both rie and lie had successful outcomes with high-dose daptomycin therapy. additional clinical trials evaluating high daptomycin dosages in patients with ie are warranted.

TI  == specificity of the neutralizers as the cause of errors in evaluating disinfectant efficacy: an assessment of triclosan.
AB  == one of the most commonly used methods for assessing disinfectants in vitro is the dilution-neutralization test. although it is known that using an effective neutralizer is essential for obtaining reliable results, in the case of disinfectants like triclosan, whose neutralization is more complicated, an adequate neutralizer is not always used. here, we compare the efficacy of different neutralizers described previously, and others that have been modified,  against several antiseptic formulations of triclosan. the strains of reference used were pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the solutions of antiseptic were triclosan 2% aqueous solution, and three alcoholic solutions containing 2, 0.068 and 0.5% triclosan, respectively. in the dilution-neutralization test, six neutralizers with different degrees of complexity were assayed. our results show that the antiseptic solutions studied are effective against the strains of reference, with the exception of triclosan 2% aqueous solution against ps. aeruginosa. most neutralizers proved ineffective, depending on the antiseptic solution and the bacterial species, particularly in the case of staph. aureus. these findings confirm a need to test every neutralizer specifically for each disinfectant, at the maximum concentration used, and for every specific bacterial strain. significance and impact of the study: the choice of an adequate neutralizing agent is essential for obtaining precise results in the evaluation of disinfectants using the dilution-neutralization method. in this study, we show that the neutralization of triclosan and some of its commercial solutions is not  a simple task, requiring complex neutralizers. moreover, the action of the neutralizer is shown to depend on the micro-organism tested. specificity in view  of the disinfectant and the micro-organism calls for performing the neutralizing  assay in each particular case of application of the dilution-neutralization method. we also demonstrate that some of the neutralizers described for triclosan in previous studies are not sufficiently effective.

TI  == risk factors and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant eskape pathogens in solid-organ transplant recipients.
AB  == background: although infections due to the six eskape pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problem, information regarding bacteremia caused by these organisms in solid-organ transplant (sot) recipients is lacking.  we sought to determine the frequency, risk factors, and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant eskape (reskape) organisms in liver, kidney, and heart adult transplant recipients. methods: all episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized sot recipients from 2007 to 2012 were analyzed. results: of 276 episodes of bacteremia, 54 (19.6%) were due to reskape strains (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium [0], methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [5], extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella  pneumoniae [10], carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii [8], carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa [26], and derepressed chromosomal  beta-lactam and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacter species [5]). factors independently associated with reskape bacteremia were prior transplantation, septic shock, and prior antibiotic therapy. patients with reskape bacteremia more often received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy than the others (41% vs. 21.6%; p=0.01). overall case-fatality rate (30 days) was higher in patients with reskape bacteremia (35.2% vs. 14.4%; p=0.001). conclusions: bacteremia due to reskape pathogens is frequent in sot recipients and causes significant morbidity and mortality. reskape organisms should be considered when selecting empirical antibiotic therapy for hospitalized sot recipients presenting with septic shock, particularly those with prior transplantation and antibiotic use.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == [an analysis of resistance of nosocomial infection pathogens isolated from 13 teaching hospitals in 2011].
AB  == objective: to investigate the pathogen profile of nosocomial infection in china,  and to survey the susceptibility rates of these pathogens to the clinical common  antibiotics. methods: the non-repetitive nosocomial pathogens isolated from bloodstream infection (bsi), hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) and intra-abdominal infection (iai) and the case data were collected from 13 teaching hospitals in different areas of china and sent to a central laboratory for re-identification and susceptibility testing. the levels of minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of the common antibiotics were determined by agar dilution method. the data were analyzed by whonet 5.6 software. results: a total of 2103 clinical isolates were collected from january to december 2011, of which gram positive cocci and gram negative organisms accounted for 23.2% and 76.8% respectively. the top three pathogens of bsi were e. coli (31.0%, 243/784), k. pneumoniae (14.8%, 116/784) and s. aureus (10.6%, 83/784). the top three pathogens of hap were a. baumannii (24.2%, 158/652), p. aeruginosa (23.0%, 150/652) and k. pneumoniae (16.4%, 107/652). the top three pathogens of iai were  e. coli (34.3%, 229/667), e. faecium (13.3%, 89/667) and k. pneumoniae (9.6%, 64/667). methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and coagulase negative staphylococcus (mrcns) accounted for 64.4% and 78.1% respectively. the susceptibility rates of staphylococcus species to tigecycline, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid were all 100%. the prevalence of mrsa in hap was significantly higher than that in bsi or iai. the susceptibility rates of enterococcus species to tigecycline, teicoplanin and linezolid were all 100%. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) was 64.3% in e. coli and 38.3% in k. pneumonia. against enterobacteriaceae, the most active agents were as following in order: tigecycline (92.3% - 100%) [except p.mirabilis], meropenem (87.5% - 100%), imipenem (87.5% - 100%) [except m. morganii], amikacin (87.5% - 100%), polymyxin b (75% - 100%) [except s. marcescens, p. mirabilis and m morganii], cefepime (67.8% - 100%), cefoperazone-sulbactam (66.6% - 100%), piperacillin-tazobactam (61.5% - 100%). carbapenem-resistance enterobacteriaceae  strains emerged. the susceptibility rates of p. aeruginosa to imipenem and meropenem were 66.2% and 72.2%, respectively. the susceptibility rates of a. baumannii to imipenem and meropenem were 27.7% and 25.9%, respectively. the most  active agents against a. baumannii were polymyxin b (100%), followed by tigecycline (79.8%) and minocycline (50.4%). the susceptibility rates of p.aeruginosa to antibiotics in bsi were higher than those in hap and iai. susceptibility rates of s. maltophilia to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline and levofloxacin were about 90% or above. susceptibility rates of b.  cepacia to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftazidime and meropenem were all 100%. several p.aeruginosa and a. baumannii strains were resistant to all tested  antibiotics except polymyxin b. conclusions: the pathogen profile is different in different types of infection. the prevalence of multi-drug resistant a. baumannii is high, which is still a key problem of nosocomial infection. tigecycline remains relatively high activity against gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacteria (except p. aeruginosa and p. mirabilis) in vitro.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a uv-stable bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) produced by enterococcus faecium strain dsh20 against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains.
AB  == background/purpose: the narrow spectrum of action of most bacteriocins is an important limitation for their application as antimicrobial agents. the current study describes a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) that display extended spectrum antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains. methods: acquired resistance profiles of enterococcus isolates determined based on the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) definition as multidrug-resistant (mdr), extensively drug-resistant (xdr) and pandrug resistant (pdr). blis activity of enterococcus isolates was investigated  against enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) atcc 29212 as the indicator strain and clinical isolates including vre, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria containing pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), klebsiella, acinetobacter, and escherichia coli (e. coli). results:  among 273 enterococcus isolates, 27 and 2 vre isolates, respectively, were xdr and pdr and eight isolates had blis activity against the indicator strain. one of these isolates, identified as e. faecium strain dsh20 based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties, as well as its 16s rrna gene sequence, had potent blis production against all 29 vre strains, but had no activity against mrsa, p.  aeruginosa, klebsiella, acinetobacter, and e. coli strains. it was heat stable up to 121 degrees c for 15 minutes (autoclave condition), active within the ph range of 3-9 and had uv stability, but its activity disappeared by treatment with proteinase k, pepsin, and trypsin, demonstrating its proteinaceous nature. it was designated as an approximately 35kda peptide using the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) method. conclusion: this peptide is a potential agent for use as an alternative antibacterial agent for the treatment of drug-resistant strains of vre infection.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of the pleuromutilin antibiotic bc-3781 against bacterial  pathogens isolated in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program in 2010.
AB  == bc-3781 is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. bc-3781 has completed a phase 2 clinical trial in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi). its antibacterial spectrum additionally covers the predominant pathogens causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). in this study, the antibacterial activity of bc-3781  was evaluated against a contemporary collection of 10,035 bacterial isolates predominately causing absssi and cabp, among other infections, collected within the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program worldwide in 2010. bc-3781 exhibited potent activity against organisms commonly isolated from absssi such as staphylococcus aureus (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 99.8% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), beta-hemolytic streptococci (mic50/90, 0.03/0.03 mug/ml; 99.3% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml; 97.8% inhibited at </=1 mug/ml). bc-3781 displayed similar mic  distributions among methicillin-susceptible (mssa) and methicillin-resistant (mrsa) s. aureus strains. bc-3781 was also active against enterococcus faecium, with 76.3% of vancomycin-susceptible and 97.0% of vancomycin-resistant isolates being inhibited at bc-3781 concentrations of </=1 mug/ml. beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci were highly susceptible to bc-3781, with 99.3% and 96.7% of isolates inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml, respectively. further, activity of  bc-3781 against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mic50/90, 1/2 mug/ml), and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) was not negatively influenced by beta-lactamase production or resistance to other antimicrobial classes tested. in all, bc-3781 displayed a very potent antibacterial profile including the most prevalent bacterial pathogens causing absssi and cabp, thus warranting further clinical development of this antibiotic in these and possibly other indications.

AB  == lysins represent a novel class of anti-infectives derived from bacteriophage. lysins are bacterial cell-wall hydrolytic enzymes that selectively and rapidly kill (>/=3 log c.f.u. in 30 min) specific gram-positive bacteria providing a targeted therapeutic approach with minimal impact on unrelated commensal flora. the potential for bacterial resistance to lysins is considered low due to targeting of highly conserved peptidoglycan components. through cutting-edge genetic engineering, lysins can be assembled into large libraries of anti-infective agents tailored to any bacterium of interest including drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin- and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. lysins can eliminate bacteria systemically and topically from mucosal surfaces and biofilms, as evidenced by experimental models of sepsis, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, and nasopharyngeal, skin and vaginal decolonization. furthermore, lysins can act synergistically with antibiotics and, in the process, resensitize bacteria to non-susceptible antibiotics. clinical trials are being prepared to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of  lysins in humans.

TI  == resistance mechanisms and epidemiology of multiresistant pathogens in europe and  efficacy of tigecycline in observational studies.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial drug resistance is a growing problem in europe and, even with differences in epidemiology, it is of great concern. the treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (csstis) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (ciais) is hindered further by pathogens that are resistant to methicillin, carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins and glycopeptides. patients and methods: an analysis of the microbiological results from five european observational studies (july 2006 to october 2011) evaluating the efficacy of tigecycline (prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials) for the treatment of cssti and ciai is presented. results:  in total, 213 cssti and 623 ciai patients were included; 34.4% and 56.6%, respectively, were critically ill in intensive care units. at baseline, at least  one pathogen was isolated in 167 (78.4%) cssti and 464 (74.5%) ciai patients, and 32.9% and 49.1% of infections were polymicrobial. in cssti, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli (52.7% and 18.0%, respectively) were the most frequently isolated pathogens, whereas in ciai most infections were due to e. coli (41.8%),  enterococcus faecium (40.1%) and enterococcus faecalis (21.1%). clinical response was observed in >80% of patients with e. coli in both ciai and cssti. in cssti patients, the clinical response rate to s. aureus was 80.8%. for ciai, 77.4% of e. faecium and 79.5% of e. faecalis patients responded to treatment. conclusions: tigecycline when given alone or in combination with other antibacterials appeared to be efficacious against multiple pathogens, affirming its role in real-life clinical practice as a broad-spectrum antibacterial for the treatment of patients with cssti and ciai, including the critically ill, across europe.

TI  == effect of in-feed paromomycin supplementation on antimicrobial resistance of enteric bacteria in turkeys.
AB  == histomoniasis in turkeys can be prevented by administering paromomycin sulfate, an aminoglycoside antimicrobial agent, in feed. the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of in-feed paromomycin sulfate supplementation on the antimicrobial resistance of intestinal bacteria in turkeys. twelve flocks of breeder turkeys were administered 100 ppm paromomycin sulfate from hatching to day 120; 12 flocks not supplemented with paromomycin were used as controls. faecal samples were collected monthly from days 0 to 180. the resistance of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus to paramomycin and other antimicrobial agents was compared in paromomycin supplemented (ps) and  unsupplemented (pns) flocks. e. coli from ps birds had a significantly higher frequency of resistance to paromomycin, neomycin and kanamycin until 1 month after the end of supplementation compared to pns birds. resistance to amoxicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also more frequent in ps turkeys. resistance was mainly due to the presence of aph genes, which could be transmitted by conjugation, sometimes with streptomycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, trimethoprim or sulfonamide resistance genes. resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin in e. faecium was significantly different in ps and pns breeders on days 60 and 90. significantly higher frequencies of resistance to paromomycin, kanamycin, neomycin and tobramycin were observed in s. aureus isolates from ps birds. paromomycin supplementation resulted in resistance to aminoglycosides in bacteria of ps turkeys. co-selection for resistance to other antimicrobial agents was observed in e. coli isolates.

TI  == combinatorial biosynthesis and antibacterial evaluation of glycosylated derivatives of 12-membered macrolide antibiotic yc-17.
AB  == expression plasmids carrying different deoxysugar biosynthetic gene cassettes and the gene encoding a substrate-flexible glycosyltransferase desvii were constructed and introduced into streptomyces venezuelae yj003 mutant strain bearing a deletion of a desosamine biosynthetic (des) gene cluster. the resulting recombinants produced macrolide antibiotic yc-17 analogs possessing unnatural sugars replacing native d-desosamine. these metabolites were isolated and further purified using chromatographic techniques and their structures were determined as d-quinovosyl-10-deoxymethynolide, l-rhamnosyl-10-deoxymethynolide, l-olivosyl-10-deoxymethynolide, and d-boivinosyl-10-deoxymethynolide on the basis of 1d and 2d nmr and ms analyses and the stereochemistry of sugars was confirmed  using coupling constant values and noe correlations. their antibacterial activities were evaluated in vitro against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. substitution with l-rhamnose displayed better antibacterial activity than parent compound yc-17 containing native sugar d-desosamine. the present study on relationships between  chemical structures and antibacterial activities could be useful in generation of novel advanced antibiotics utilizing combinatorial biosynthesis approach.

TI  == activity of four antimicrobial cocktails for tissue allograft decontamination against bacteria and candida spp. of known susceptibility at different temperatures.
AB  == several antimicrobial cocktail solutions of differing composition and concentrations are widely used to decontaminate viable banked tissue allografts at different temperatures and times of exposure. we compared the efficiency of four cocktails comprising nine antimicrobials to kill suspensions of a panel of 27 strains of 13 bacterial species, and 3 candida spp. at 4, 22 and 37 degrees c  for 24 h. all but one bacterial strains were susceptible to one or more of the agents tested individually at concentrations at least fourfold below the recommended susceptibility breakpoint minimum inhibitory concentrations for drug/species combinations. candida lusitaniae was resistant to nystatin and amphotericin. the concentrations of several of the cocktail constituents were often greatly in excess (50-1,000-fold) of that required to inhibit the growth of susceptible strains. all cocktails were ineffective against a pan-resistant strain of enterococcus faecium and one of the four cocktails failed to kill two strains of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. each cocktail was most efficient at 37 degrees c, less so at 22 degrees c, and poorly active at 4 degrees c. we conclude that the practice of decontamination of tissues with antimicrobials at low temperatures is not supported by in vitro susceptibility tests.

TI  == bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bloodstream infections in children with febrile neutropenia: experience of single center in southeast of turkey.
AB  == empirical antimicrobial therapy is usually started in febrile neutropenic patients without having culture results. the aim of this study was to help determine the policies of empirical antibiotic usage in febrile neutropenic children by detecting the antimicrobial susceptibility profile in this group of patients. in this study 811 blood cultures taken from neutropenic children hospitalized at the department of oncology of gaziantep children hospital november 2007 and february 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. blood cultures were routinely collected in aerobic and anaerobic media and incubated using the bactec system. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates to antimicrobial agents was performed using the vitek2((r)) system according to the recommendations of the clinical and laboratory standards institute. of 811 isolates analyzed, 128 (56.4%) were gram positive cocci, 43 (18.9%) were gram negative bacilli and fungi accounted for 56 (24.7%). the main isolated gram-positive bacteria from blood were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (56.7%), followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (14.1%). s. aureus and streptococcus spp. were all susceptible to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin. s aureus was still susceptible to few other antimicrobial agents such as tetracycline (82.4%), chloramphenicol (55.6%). seven e. faecium, 7 e. fecalis and 1 e. hirae was isolated from blood cultures. vancomycin resistance was detected in 6 out of 15 (40%) enterococcus spp. isolates. among gram-negative bacteria e. coli (30.2%) was followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (20.9%) and proteus spp. (18.6%). imipenem (89.2%), meropenem (86.6%), chloramphenicol (88.9%), amicasin (82.4%) and fosfomycin (81.3%) showed highest susceptibility in vitro activity against all gram-negative isolates. to know the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the pathogens frequently isolated from febrile neutropenic children and to consider this profile before starting an empirical antibiotic therapy would help the clinics which have any role in the treatment of these patients to determine the empirical antibiotic usage policies.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility among gram-positive organisms collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) was designed to monitor  global longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial agents, including tigecycline. in this study, we examine susceptibility among gram-positive isolates collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011. a total of 9,422 gram-positive isolates were contributed by 1,255 centers, predominantly from europe and north america. one-third of staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, peaking in prevalence in 2007. all s. aureus isolates (n = 3,614) were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin; minocycline, imipenem, and meropenem were also highly active (>92% susceptibility). ampicillin and penicillin susceptibility increased significantly during the study period (p < 0.0001 for both). streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 3,373) were highly susceptible to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (>99%), and levofloxacin and tigecycline (both >96%); imipenem susceptibility was low (32%) in africa while minocycline susceptibility was low in asia-pacific rim (38%). penicillin resistance occurred  in one-fifth of all s. pneumoniae isolates, with penicillin susceptibility ranging from 14% in africa to 65% in europe. streptococcus agalactiae isolates (n = 1,056) were highly susceptible to most antimicrobials, although only 16% were susceptible to minocycline. enterococcus faecalis isolates (n = 1,112) were highly susceptible (>97%) to ampicillin, linezolid, penicillin, tigecycline, and  vancomycin globally, but only 34% were minocycline susceptible; minocycline susceptibility decreased significantly from 2004 to 2011 (p < 0.001). tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against enterococcus faecium (n = 267) globally  (100% and 98% susceptible, respectively). tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against gram-positive pathogens from pediatric patients in test 2004 to 2011, with vancomycin and the carbapenems performing well against most pathogens.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from milkmen and cows with clinical mastitis in and around kampala, uganda.
AB  == background: identification of pathogens associated with bovine mastitis is helpful in treatment and management decisions. however, such data from sub-saharan africa is scarce. here we describe the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from cows with clinical mastitis in kampala,  uganda. due to high concern of zoonotic infections, isolates from milkmen are also described. methodology/principal findings: ninety seven milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 31 nasal swabs from milkmen were collected (one sample per cow/human). fifty eight (60%) gram-positive isolates namely staphylococci (21), enterococci (16), streptococci (13), lactococci (5), micrococci (2) and arcanobacteria (1) were detected in cows; only one grew staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, 24 (25%) coliforms namely escherichia coli (12), klebsiella oxytoca (5), proteus vulgaris (2), serratia (2), citrobacter (1), cedecea (1) and leclercia (1) were identified. from humans, 24 gram-positive bacteria grew, of which 11 were staphylococci (35%) including four staphylococcus aureus. upon susceptibility testing, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) were prevalent; 57%, 12/21 in cows and 64%, 7/11 in humans.  however, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was not detected. furthermore, methicillin and vancomycin resistant cons were detected in cows (staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus lugdunensis) and humans (staphylococcus scuiri). also, vancomycin and daptomycin resistant enterococci (enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively) were detected in cows. coliforms were less resistant with three pan-susceptible isolates. however, multidrug resistant klebsiella, proteus, serratia, cedecea, and citrobacter were detected.  lastly, similar species grew from human and bovine samples but on genotyping, the isolates were found to be different. interestingly, human and bovine staphylococcus aureus were genetically similar (spa-cc435, spa-type t645 corresponding to st121) but with different susceptibility patterns. conclusions/significance: cons, enterococci, streptococci, and escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens associated with clinical bovine-mastitis in kampala, uganda. multidrug resistant bacteria are also prevalent. while similar species occurred in humans and cows, transmission was not detected.

TI  == analysis of the tolerance of pathogenic enterococci and staphylococcus aureus to  cell wall active antibiotics.
AB  == objectives: tolerance refers to the phenomenon that bacteria do not significantly die when exposed to bactericidal antibiotics. enterococci are known for their high tolerance to these drugs, but the molecular reasons why they resist killing  are not understood. in a previous study we showed that the superoxide dismutase (sod) is implicated in this tolerance. this conclusion was based on the results obtained with one particular strain of enterococcus faecalis and therefore the objective of the present communication was to analyse whether dependence of tolerance on active sod is a general phenomenon for enterococci and another gram-positive pathogen, staphylococcus aureus. methods: mutants deficient in sod  activity were constructed in pathogenic enterococci. the wild-type soda gene was  cloned into an expression vector and transformed into sod-deficient strains for complementation with varying levels of sod activity. previously constructed sod-deficient strains of s. aureus were also included in this study. tolerance to vancomycin and penicillin was then tested. results: we demonstrated that the dependence on sod of tolerance to vancomycin and penicillin is a common trait of  antibiotic-susceptible pathogenic enterococci. by varying the levels of expression we could also show that tolerance to vancomycin is directly correlated to sod activity. interestingly, deletion of the soda gene in a non-tolerant enterococcus faecium strain did not further sensitize the mutant to bactericidal  antibiotics. finally, we showed that the sod enzymes of s. aureus are also implicated in tolerance to vancomycin. conclusion: high tolerance of enterococci  to cell wall active antibiotics can be reversed by sod deficiency.

TI  == bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  == purpose: cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (bsis). most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. we here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in bsis in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. methods: we analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between january 2005 and january 2011. results: a total of 4,918 episodes of bsi  occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). in both patient groups, gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). amongst gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. amongst gram-negative organisms, escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following bsi compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. conclusion: these data demonstrate distinct bsi pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive pathogens collected in europe, latin america, and selected countries in the asia-pacific region (2011).
AB  == we report the results of the international daptomycin surveillance programs for europe, latin america, and selected asia-pacific nations. a total of 7948 consecutive gram-positive organisms of clinical significance were collected in 2011 and susceptibility tested against daptomycin and various comparator agents by clinical and laboratory standards institute (clinical and laboratory standards institute. m07-a9. methods for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically; approved standard: ninth edition wayne, pa: clsi. 2012.; cubicin package insert 2012. cubist pharmaceuticals, inc, lexington, ma. available at http://www.cubicin.com/pdf/prescribinginformation.pdf. accessed january 1, 2012.) broth microdilution methods. the test medium was adjusted to contain physiological levels of calcium (50 mg/l) when testing daptomycin. daptomycin exhibited potent activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus overall and for each region (mic(50/90), 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/ml), with susceptibility rates at 100.0% in latin america, australia/new zealand, and india, and at 99.9% in europe. the daptomycin mic(50/90) for coagulase-negative staphylococci was also at 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/ml,  and only 1 isolate was considered nonsusceptible with a mic value at 2 mug/ml. daptomycin was also highly active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(50/90), 1/1-2 mug/ml) and e. faecium (mic(50/90), 2/2 mug/ml for both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant isolates). all enterococcal isolates were susceptible to daptomycin (mic, </=4 mug/ml) and tigecycline. susceptibility to linezolid for e. faecalis was at 100.0%, while for e. faecium regional susceptibility rates were at 100.0% except in europe (99.0%). viridans group streptococci (mic(50/90), 0.25/1 mug/ml) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), </=0.06/0.25 mug/ml) continue to be very susceptible to daptomycin.  in summary, the results of this investigation document the high potency and wide  spectrum of daptomycin when tested against a large resistance-surveillance collection of gram-positive pathogens and indicate that daptomycin nonsusceptibility remains rare among indicated species after many years of clinical use worldwide.

TI  == safety assessment and probiotic evaluation of enterococcus faecium yf5 isolated from sourdough.
AB  == enterococcus faecium yf5, a strain previously isolated from sourdough, was assessed for safety and probiotic potential. its virulence and antibiotic resistant phenotypes (cytolysin and gelatinase production, antibiotic susceptibility) and genes (cyla, gele, ace, agg, esp, and vana) were surveyed. results indicated that the tested virulence determinants were nontoxic. in addition, e. faecium yf5 was sensitive to 3 antibiotics such as amoxicillin, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol. furthermore, results of in vivo animal acute oral toxicity of e. faecium yf5 studies were similar to the control group that indicated no abnormalities. in addition, e. faecium yf5 stably survived in low ph, bile salts, gastric, and intestinal fluids in vitro. moreover, e. faecium yf5 was found to adhere to human colon cancer cell line ht-29 at 3.39 (+/-0.67) x 10(5) cfu/ml. when cocultured with pathogenic organisms (enterobacter sakazakii cmcc45402, escherichia coli cmcc44102, enterohemorrhage escherichia coli o157: h7 cmcc44828, salmonella typhimurium cmcc50071, shigella flexneri 301, and shigella  sonnei atcc 29930) and 2 gram-positive strains (listeria monocytogenes cmcc54001  and staphylococcus aureus cmcc 26003), it inhibited these foodborne pathogens with exception of s. aureus. therefore, e. faecium yf5 can be regarded as a safe  strain and it may be used as a probiotic preparation or for microecologics.

TI  == an international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: zaaps program results for 2011.
AB  == through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and hong kong. linezolid mic90 values were 2 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the mic90 value was 1 mug/ml for coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), beta-hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid  demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. all s. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/ml. three (0.3%) of 928 strains of cons had a linezolid mic of 4 mug/ml and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in l3. there were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (brazil [5],  france [1], germany [2] greece [2], italy [2], ireland [1], and spain [1]) representing 5 species (e. faecium, s. capitis, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, s. lugdenensis). a mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid  mic values; one was a s. haemolyticus isolate with a mic at 4 mug/ml. resistance  rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 zaaps program: cons, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among s aureus, s. pneumoniae, viridans  group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected.  as the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal activity of methanol extracts of crabapple mangrove tree (sonneratia caseolaris linn.) against multi-drug resistant pathogens.
AB  == the crabapple mangrove tree, sonneratia caseolaris linn. (family: sonneratiaceae), is one of the foreshore plants found in estuarine and tidal creek areas and mangrove forests. bark and fruit extracts from this plant have previously been shown to have an anti-oxidative or cytotoxic effect, whereas flower extracts of this plant exhibited an antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. according to the traditional folklore, it is medicinally used as an astringent and antiseptic. hence, this investigation was carried out on the extract of the leaves, pneumatophore and different parts of the flower or fruit (stamen, calyx, meat of fruit, persistent calyx of fruit and seeds) for antibacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. the antibacterial activity was evaluated against five antibiotic-sensitive species (three gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria) and six drug-resistant species (gram-positive i.e. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and gram-negative i.e. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-escherichia coli, multidrug-resistant-pseudomonas aeruginosa and acenetobacter baumannii). the methanol extracts from all tested parts of the crabapple mangrove tree exhibited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but was mainly a bactericidal against the gram-negative bacteria, including the multidrug-resistant strains, when compared with only bacteriostatic on the gram-positive bacteria. using soxhlet apparatus, the extracts obtained by sequential extraction with hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate revealed no discernable antibacterial activity  and only slightly, if at all, reduced the antibacterial activity of the subsequently obtained methanol extract. therefore, the active antibacterial compounds of the crabapple mangrove tree should have a rather polar structure.

TI  == independent risk factors for the co-colonization of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in the region most endemic for vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolation.
AB  == in the majority of cases of vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vr e. faecalis) served as the vana donor to s. aureus. previous studies that evaluated the risk factors for co-colonization with vre and mrsa did not differentiate between vr e. faecalis and vr e. faecium. this study aimed to identify variables associated with vr e. faecalis and mrsa co-colonization. a retrospective case-control study from january 2008 to december 2009 was conducted at the detroit medical center. data were extracted from charts and pharmacy records. unique patients co-colonized with vr e. faecalis and mrsa (defined as isolation of mrsa within 7 days of vr e. faecalis isolation) were compared with patients with vr e. faecalis who were not  co-colonized with mrsa. a total of 546 patients with vr e. faecalis isolation were identified. 85 (15.6 %) vr e. faecalis patients were co-colonized with mrsa  and 461 (84.4 %) vr e. faecalis patients were not co-colonized with mrsa. the mean age of the study cohort was 65.9 +/- 16.4 years, 424 (77.7 %) were african-american, and 270 (49.5 %) were residing in long-term care institutions.  independent predictors of co-colonization of vr e. faecalis and mrsa were male gender, impaired consciousness, icu stay prior to vr e. faecalis isolation, indwelling devices, and isolation of vr e. faecalis from wounds. mrsa was frequently isolated from the same culture specimen as vr e. faecalis (n = 39, 45.9 %), most commonly from wounds. this large study of patients with vr e. faecalis identified the severity of illness, indwelling devices, and chronic wounds as independent predictors of co-colonization with vr e. faecalis and mrsa.

TI  == recent trends in resistance to cell envelope-active antibacterial agents among key bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cell envelope-active agents, particularly beta-lactams, play a pivotal role in the treatment of bacterial infections and the extent to which their activity is affected by the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms is of concern. we analyzed the surveillance network (tsn) database to evaluate resistant trends for key cell envelope-active drugs among eskape pathogens. analysis demonstrated that the activity of these drugs has been notably influenced by the emergence of multidrug resistance; this was especially evident for the beta-lactam drugs. for  example, acinetobacter baumannii resistance to imipenem increased from 23.9% to 34.3%, and resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 37.0% to 49.7% between 2007 and 2011. during the same time period klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to imipenem increased from 0.8% to 3.8%. as beta-lactams are a cornerstone of anti-infective therapy, it is important to closely monitor the activity of the agents being used today and to aggressively pursue new strategies that can augment current drugs and thwart ever-emerging beta-lactam resistance mechanisms that are continuously encountered.

TI  == verigene(r) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test.
AB  == bloodstream infections (bsis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. a key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with bsis is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. however, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. during the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of bsis and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. this review focuses on the  properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the verigene((r)) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic gram-positive bacteria associated with bsis, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., listeria spp., and enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (meca, vana, and vanb). based  on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between bc-gp test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree  of agreement for identification of meca-mediated meticillin resistance in s. aureus and s. epidermidis organisms and vana- or vanb-mediated vancomycin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium organisms.

TI  == improving linezolid use decreases the incidence of resistance among gram-positive microorganisms.
AB  == surveillance studies have shown the emergence of infections with linezolid-resistant bacteria. the relationship between appropriate linezolid use  and the spread of linezolid resistance among gram-positive microorganisms in a single tertiary referral centre was evaluated. in an initial observational study, a prospective prescription-indication study was conducted on intensive care areas and haematology, neurosurgery, vascular surgery and nephrology wards during 2009. an intervention through follow-up feedback on audit results from may-june 2010 was then conducted. from july-december 2010, a second drug-use study of linezolid was conducted, with the same objectives and methodology. to assess the antimicrobial pressure of linezolid, an ecological study was conducted from 2006-2010 in the same hospital wards. indications for linezolid in the initial study were considered suitable in 38.5% of cases, whilst in the second study the  rate was 51.2% (33% increase). linezolid consumption fell by 57% in the second half of 2010. a significant correlation was found between its inadequate use (ddd/1000 patient-days) and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains/1000 patient-days (r=0.93; p=6.9e-024); 85% of the variability in the incidence of linezolid resistance was predicted by its inadequate use. its partial correlations were significant for enterococcus faecium (r=0.407; p=0.049), staphylococcus epidermidis (r=0.874; p=2.3e-008) and staphylococcus haemolyticus  (r=0.406; p=0.049) but not staphylococcus aureus (r=0.051; p=0.704). a relationship was found between appropriate linezolid use and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains of e. faecium, s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus.

AB  == background: there is a lack of consensus regarding the definition of risk factors for healthcare-associated infection (hcai). the purpose of this study was to identify additional risk factors for hcai, which are not included in the current  definition of hcai, associated with infection by multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens, in all hospitalized infected patients from the community. methods: this 1-year prospective cohort study included all patients with infection admitted to a large, tertiary care, university hospital. risk factors not included in the hcai definition, and independently associated with mdr pathogen infection, namely mdr gram-negative (mdr-gn) and eskape microorganisms (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella species, carbapenem-hydrolyzing klebsiella pneumonia and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter species), were identified by logistic regression among patients admitted from the community (either with community-acquired or hcai). results: there were 1035 patients with  infection, 718 from the community. of these, 439 (61%) had microbiologic documentation; 123 were mdr (28%). among mdr: 104 (85%) had mdr-gn and 41 (33%) had an eskape infection. independent risk factors associated with mdr and mdr-gn  infection were: age (adjusted odds ratio (or) = 1.7 and 1.5, p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively), and hospitalization in the previous year (between 4 and 12  months previously) (adjusted or = 2.0 and 1,7, p = 0.008 and p = 0.048, respectively). infection by pathogens from the eskape group was independently associated with previous antibiotic therapy (adjusted or = 7.2, p < 0.001) and a  karnofsky index <70 (adjusted or = 3.7, p = 0.003). patients with infection by mdr, mdr-gn and pathogens from the eskape group had significantly higher rates of inadequate antibiotic therapy than those without (46% vs 7%, 44% vs 10%, 61% vs 15%, respectively, p < 0.001). conclusions: this study suggests that the inclusion of additional risk factors in the current definition of hcai for mdr pathogen infection, namely age >60 years, karnofsky index <70, hospitalization in the previous year, and previous antibiotic therapy, may be clinically beneficial  for early diagnosis, which may decrease the rate of inadequate antibiotic therapy among these patients.

TI  == environmental contamination by dog&#8217;s faeces: a public health problem?
AB  == the risk to public health from the large number of dog stools present on streets  of urban areas is cause for concern. dog faeces may be a serious hazard because they may contain microorganisms that are both pathogenic to humans and resistant  to several classes of antibiotics. the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for zoonotic infections and for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in canine faeces which contaminates the urban environment. a total of 418 canine faecal samples were collected from streets in seven areas of bari, southern italy. we have isolated multi-drug resistant enterococci and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from these dog faecal samples. the presence of the resistant bacteria in an urban environment may represent a public health hazard which requires control measures by competent authorities. no salmonella, yersinia or campylobacter species were isolated. giardia cysts were detected in 1.9% of the samples. the predominant enterococcus species were e. faecium (61.6%), e. gallinarum (23.3%) and e. casseliflavus (5.5%). other species, including e. faecalis were also isolated. these strains were resistant to clindamycin (86.3%), tetracycline (65.7%), erythromycin (60.27%) and ampicillin (47.9%). high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was found in 65.7% of enterococci. resistance to three or more antibiotics and six or more antibiotics were observed in 67.12% and 38.4% of enterococcus spp., respectively. resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not detected in any of the enterococcus spp. isolated. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 0.7% of the faecal samples. canine faeces left on the streets may represent a risk factor for transmission of microorganisms and a reservoir of multidrug- resistant bacteria thus contributing to the spread of resistance genes into an urban area.

TI  == twenty-five years of shared life with vancomycin-resistant enterococci: is it time to divorce?
AB  == twenty-five years ago, isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vrem) was reported both in the uk and in france. since then, vrem has spread worldwide in hospitals. hospital outbreaks appeared to be related to the evolution since the end of 1980s of a subpopulation of e. faecium highly resistant to ampicillin and fluoroquinolones (the so-called clonal complex cc17)  that later acquired resistance to vancomycin. cc17 isolates are presumably better adapted than other e. faecium isolates to the constraints of the hospital environment and most contain mobile genetic elements, phage genes, genes encoding membrane proteins, regulatory genes, a putative pathogenicity island and megaplasmids. colonization and persistence are major features of vrem. inherent characteristics of e. faecium including a remarkable genome plasticity, in part due to acquisition of is elements, in particular is16, have facilitated niche adaptation of this distinct e. faecium subpopulation that is multiply resistant to antibiotics. quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid are licensed for the treatment of vrem infections, with linezolid often used as a first-line treatment. however, the emergence of plasmid-mediated resistance to linezolid by  production of a cfr methyltransferase in enterococcus faecalis is worrying. daptomycin has not been extensively evaluated for the treatment of vrem infections and resistant mutants have been selected under daptomycin therapy. although control of vre is challenging, a laissez-faire policy would result in an increased number of infections and would create an irreversible situation. although so far unsuccessful, dissemination of glycopeptide-resistant staphylococcus aureus with van genes acquired from resistant enterococci cannot be ruled out.

TI  == assessment of safe enterococci as bioprotective cultures in low-acid fermented sausages combined with high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == three bacteriocinogenic, non-aminogenic and non-virulent enterococcus strains (enterococcus faecium ctc8005, enterococcus devriesei ctc8006 and enterococcus casseliflavus ctc8003) were used as starter cultures in low-acid fermented sausages to assess their competitiveness and their bioprotective potential against listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the inoculated strains  were successfully monitored by rapd-pcr. all the strains were able to grow, survive and dominate the endogenous enterococci population and avoided the growth of enterobacteriaceae. e. devriesei ctc8006 and e. faecium ctc8005 particularly inhibited the growth of l. monocytogenes during the whole ripening process. s. aureus was not affected by the inoculated bacteriocinogenic enterococci strains.  the application of high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) treatment (600 mpa for 5 min)  at the end of ripening (day 21) produced an immediate reduction in the counts of  enterobacteriaceae to levels <1 log cfu/g and promoted a decrease of 1-log unit in the counts of s. aureus. e. faecium ctc8005, which reduced the counts of l. monocytogenes ca. 2 log cfu/g immediately after stuffing and in combination with  hhp treatment promoted a further reduction of 1 log cfu/g in the pathogen counts. the combination of e. faecium ctc8005 and hhp was the most efficient antilisterial approach.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acid exhibit potent bactericidal activity against eskape pathogens.
AB  == a series of 36 synthetic antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acids  were screened to determine their effectiveness to treat enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pnemoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens, which are known to commonly infect chronic wounds. the primary amino acid sequences of these peptides incorporate either three or six dipeptide units consisting of the unnatural amino acids tetrahydroisoquinolinecarboxylic acid (tic) and octahydroindolecarboxylic acid (oic). the tic-oic dipeptide units are separated by spacer amino acids with specific physicochemical properties that control how these peptides interact with bacterial cell membranes of different chemical compositions. these peptides exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against these pathogens in the range from >100 to 6.25 mug/ml. the observed diversity of mic values for these peptides against the various bacterial strains  are consistent with our hypothesis that the complementarity of the physicochemical properties of the peptide and the lipid of the bacteria's cell membrane determines the resulting antibacterial activity of the peptide.

AB  == the zyvox(r) annual appraisal of potency and spectrum (zaaps) program monitors the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents for gram-positive organisms in latin america, europe, canada, and the asia-pacific. for the 2010 program a total of 6305 gram-positive strains were collected from 75 medical centres on five continents (24 countries). reference broth microdilution susceptibility tests were performed on organisms from the following groups: staphylococcus aureus (2875), coagulase negative staphylococci (cons) (855), enterococci (787), streptococcus pneumoniae (926), viridans group and other streptococci (325), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (507). linezolid demonstrated a 99.81% susceptibility rate among 6305 strains tested from 24 nations. of the resistant isolates, four linezolid-resistant strains of enterococci (two each for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium) were found in four nations (china, thailand, germany, and brazil). eight cons (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hominis) isolates were observed to be resistant to linezolid (mic, >/=8 mug/ml). two strains from mexico were determined to be from an ongoing epidemic, and investigations showed that isolates from italy and brazil were also from circulating resistant clones discovered in earlier years. mrsa rates varied by region and between nations, as  did resistances to other potential therapeutic agent options frequently listed for mrsa therapy such as clindamycin, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. in summary, the 2010 zaaps program demonstrated that linezolid activity remains stable around the world with >99% susceptibility.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == ultraviolet disinfection of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their antibiotic resistance genes in water and wastewater.
AB  == disinfection of wastewater treatment plant effluent may be an important barrier for limiting the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (arbs) and antibiotic resistance genes (args). while ideally disinfection should destroy args, to prevent horizontal gene transfer to downstream bacteria, little is known about the effect of conventional water disinfection technologies on args. this study examined the potential of uv disinfection to damage four args, mec(a), van(a), tet(a), and amp(c), both in extracellular form and present within a host arbs: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre), escherichia coli sms-3-5, and pseudomonas aeruginosa  01, respectively. an extended amplicon-length quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was developed to enhance capture of arg damage events and also to  normalize to an equivalent length of target dna ( approximately 1000 bp) for comparison. it was found that the two gram-positive arbs (mrsa and vre) were more resistant to uv disinfection than the two gram-negative arbs (e. coli and p. aeruginosa). the two gram-positive organisms also possessed smaller total genome  sizes, which could also have reduced their susceptibility to uv because of fewer  potential pyrimidine dimer targets. an effect of cell type on damage to args was  only observed in vre and p. aeruginosa, the latter potentially because of extracellular polymeric substances. in general, damage of args required much greater uv doses (200-400 mj/cm(2) for 3- to 4-log reduction) than arb inactivation (10-20 mj/cm(2) for 4- to 5-log reduction). the proportion of amplifiable args following uv treatment exhibited a strong negative correlation with the number of adjacent thymines (pearson r < -0.9; p < 0.0001). arbs surviving uv treatment were negatively correlated with total genome size (pearson r < -0.9; p < 0.0001) and adjacent cytosines (pearson r < -0.88; p < 0.0001) but  positively correlated with adjacent thymines (pearson r > 0.85; p < 0.0001). this suggests that formation of thymine dimers is not the sole mechanism of arb inactivation. overall, the results indicate that uv is limited in its potential to damage args and other disinfection technologies should be explored.

TI  == biocidal activity of metalloacid-coated surfaces against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
AB  == background: the antimicrobial effects of a coating of molybdenum trioxide (moo3)  has been recently described. the metalloacid material produces oxonium ions (h3o+), which creates an acidic ph that is an effective, non specific antimicrobial. we determined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of molybdenum trioxide metalloacid-coated surfaces. methods: metalloacid-coated and non-coated  (control) surfaces were contaminated by exposing them for 15 minutes to microbial suspensions containing 105 cfu/ml. eleven microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections were tested: two staphylococcus aureus strains (the hetero-vancomycin intermediate mrsa mu50 strain and a st80-pvl-producing mrsa strain); a vancomycin-resistant vana enterococcus faecium strain; three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae strains; a mbl-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strain; a multidrug-resistant acinetobacter  baumannii strain; a toxin-producing clostridium difficile strain; and two fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus). the assay tested the ability of the coated surfaces to kill microorganisms. results: against all non-sporulating microorganisms tested, metalloacid-coated surfaces exhibited significant antimicrobial activity relative to that of the control surfaces within two to six hours after contact with the microorganisms (p < 0.001). microorganism survival on the coated surfaces was greatly impaired, whereas microorganism survival on control surfaces remained substantial. conclusions: we suggest that, facing the continuing shedding of microorganisms in the vicinity of colonized or infected patients, the continuous biocidal effect of hydroxonium oxides against multidrug-resistant microorganisms may help limit environmental contamination between consecutive cleaning procedures.

TI  == rapid identification of gram-positive pathogens and their resistance genes from positive blood culture broth using a multiplex tandem rt-pcr assay.
AB  == the early initiation of targeted antibiotic therapy in patients with bacteraemia  and septic shock impacts favourably on outcomes. rapid methods are therefore increasingly employed for bacterial identification directly from positive blood culture bottles, but with variable success. we evaluated the performance of the gram positive 12 multiplex tandem pcr (mt-pcr) assay (ausdiagnostics; catalogue no. 6202, version 07) containing targets for the identification of staphylococci  including staphylococcus aureus, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci including enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and their common antibiotic resistance genes (meca, vana, vanb). a total of 673 aerobic and anaerobic blood culture broths demonstrating gram-positive cocci on microscopy were analysed in parallel with traditional phenotypic methods. amplification of the internal control was inhibited in 79/673 (11.7 %) samples; however, mt-pcr identification was in concordance with phenotypic identification to the genus level in 96.6 % (537/556) of the remaining monomicrobial specimens and to the species level, where applicable, in 100 % (172/172) of samples. mt-pcr identification for 94.7 % (36/38) of polymicrobial samples matched traditional phenotypic identification. meticillin and vancomycin susceptibility results determined by mt-pcr in blood culture broths demonstrated complete agreement with those determined by phenotypic methods in all 143 staphylococcus aureus isolates  and eight e. faecium isolates, respectively. gram-positive pathogens and their key antibiotic resistance markers were reliably identified with the mt-pcr assay  within 3 h of a positive blood culture result.

TI  == screen for agents that induce autolysis in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == the growing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections underscores the need to discover new antibiotics and to use them with maximum effectiveness. in response  to these needs, we describe a screening protocol for the discovery of autolysis-inducing agents that uses two bacillus subtilis reporter strains, sh-536 and bau-102. to screen chemical libraries, autolysis-inducing agents were  first identified with a bau-102-based screen and then subdivided with sh-536 into two major groups: those that induce autolysis by their direct action on the cell  membrane and those that induce autolysis secondary to inhibition of cell wall synthesis. sh-536 distinguishes between the two groups of autolysis-inducing agents by synthesizing and then releasing beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) in late stationary phase at a time that cells have nearly stopped growing and are therefore tolerant of cell wall synthesis inhibitors. four hits, named compound 2, compound 3, compound 5, and compound 24, obtained previously as inducers of autolysis by screening a 10,080-compound discovery library with bau-102, were probed with sh-536 and found to release beta-gal, indicating that their mode of action was to permeabilize the b. subtilis cell membrane. the four primary hits inhibited growth in staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus anthracis, with mics in the 12.5- to 25-mug/ml (20 to 60 mum) range. the four primary hits were further used to probe b. subtilis, and their action was partially characterized with respect to the dependence of induced autolysis on specific autolysins.

TI  == influence of the n- and c-terminal regions of antimicrobial peptide pleurocidin on antibacterial activity.
AB  == pleurocidin, a 25-mer antimicrobial peptide, has been known to exhibit potent antibacterial activity. to investigate the functional roles in n- and c-terminal  regions of pleurocidin on the antibacterial activity, we designed four truncated  analogs. the antibacterial susceptibility testing showed that pleurocidin and its analogs exerted antibacterial effect against various bacterial strains and further possessed specific activity patterns corresponding with their hydrophobic scale [pleurocidin &gt; anal 3 (1-22) > anal 1 (4-25) > anal 4 (1-19) > anal 2 (7-25)]. fluorescence experiments using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (dph) and 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide [disc3(5)] indicated that the differences  in antibacterial activity of the peptides were caused by its membrane-active mechanisms including membrane disruption and depolarization. blue shift in tryptophan fluorescence demonstrated that the decrease in net hydrophobicity attenuates the binding affinity of pleurocidin to interact with plasma membrane.  therefore, the present study suggests that hydrophobicity in the n- and c-terminal regions of pleurocidin plays a key role in its antibacterial activity.

TI  == epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis: a case-case-control study.
AB  == although much is known about vancomycin-resistant (vr) enterococcus faecium, little is known about the epidemiology of vr enterococcus faecalis. the predilection of vr e. faecalis to transfer the vancomycin resistance determinant  to staphylococcus aureus is much greater than that of vr e. faecium. the epidemiology of vr e. faecalis has important implications regarding the emergence of vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa); 8 of 13 reported vrsa cases have been from michigan. a retrospective case-case-control study was conducted at the detroit medical center, located in southeastern michigan. unique patients with vr e. faecalis infection were matched to patients with strains of vancomycin-susceptible (vs) e. faecalis and to uninfected controls at a 1:1:1 ratio. five hundred thirty-two vr e. faecalis cases were identified and were matched to 532 vs e. faecalis cases and 532 uninfected controls. the overall mean age of the study cohort (n = 1,596) was 63.0 +/- 17.4 years, and 747 (46.8%) individuals were male. independent predictors for the isolation of vr e. faecalis (but not vs e. faecalis) compared to uninfected controls were an age of >/=65 years, nonhome residence, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, exposure to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in the prior 3 months, and immunosuppressive status. invasive procedures and/or surgery, chronic skin ulcers, and indwelling devices were risk factors for both vr e. faecalis and vs e. faecalis isolation. cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone exposures were unique, independent predictors for isolation of vr e. faecalis. a majority of case patients had vr e. faecalis present at the time of admission. control of vr e. faecalis, and ultimately vrsa, will likely require regional efforts focusing on infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship.

AB  == inadvertent exposure of bacterial pathogens to x-ray radiation may be an environmental stress, where the bacterium may respond by increasing mutational events, thereby potentially resulting in increased antibiotic resistance and alteration to genotypic profile. in order to examine this, four clinical pathogens, including the gram-negative organisms escherichia coli o157:h7 nctc12900 and pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc10662, as well as the gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus nctc6571 and enterococcus faecium were exposed to x-rays (35,495 cgy/cm2) over a seven-day period. antibiotic susceptibility was assessed before, during and after exposure by examining susceptibility, as quantified by e-test with six antibiotics, as well as to a further 11 antibiotics by measurement of susceptibility zone sizes (mm). additionally, the dna profile of each organism was compared before, during and after exposure employing the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (eric pcr). results indicated that exposure of these organisms to this amount of x-ray  radiation did not alter their antibiotic susceptibility, nor their genomic dna profile. overall, these data indicate that exposure of bacteria to x-ray radiation does not alter the test organisms' antibiotic susceptibility profiles,  nor alter genomic dna profiles of bacteria, which therefore does not compromise molecular epidemiological tracking of bacteria within healthcare environments in  which patients have been exposed to x-ray radiation.

TI  == therapy of 1,025 severely ill patients with complicated infections in a german multicenter study: safety profile and efficacy of tigecycline in different treatment modalities.
AB  == this large prospective non-interventional study investigated the effects of tigecycline either as single agent or in combination with other antimicrobial agents in 1,025 patients treated in clinical routine at german hospitals. sixty-five percent of the patients had apache ii scores > 15, indicating high overall disease severity. complicated intra-abdominal infections (ciai) or complicated skin and skin tissue infections (cssti) were the most common indications, with staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium and escherichia coli being the most frequently isolated pathogens. clinical success was reported  at the end of tigecycline therapy in 74.2% of the total population, in 75.4% of the ciai and in 82.2% of the cssti patients. the subpopulation (28.0% of the patients) infected with multidrug-resistant pathogens (methicillin-resistant s. aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers and vancomycin-resistant enterococci) were treated with similar success rates as the overall population. tigecycline was generally well tolerated. drug-related adverse events (aes) were  reported in 7.7% of the total population; 2.5% had serious aes mostly attributable to inefficacy of therapy or deterioration of the disease. mortality  rates were consistent with the types of infection and severity of illness. there  was no indication of excessive mortality associated with tigecycline as had been  suggested in previously performed meta-analyses. in this large non-interventional study performed in the clinical routine setting, tigecycline achieved favorable clinical success rates in a patient population with high severity of illness and  a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens and showed a good safety and tolerability profile.

TI  == the changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in europe: trends from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system.
AB  == we investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in europe. aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (earss) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. trend analyses used generalized linear models. robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. from 2002 to 2008, the overall number  of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (ci) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. in the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% ci 6.9-7.5%). the frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in e. coli and enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% ci 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year;  95% ci -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive s. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% ci 3.0-3.7). increasing rates of e. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. our data  suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during earss surveillance. trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. it appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. as a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.

TI  == adenylate kinase release as a high-throughput-screening-compatible reporter of bacterial lysis for identification of antibacterial agents.
AB  == adenylate kinase (ak) is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released into  the extracellular space upon cell lysis. we have shown that ak release serves as  a useful reporter of bactericidal agent activity and can be exploited for antimicrobial screening purposes. the ak assay exhibits improved sensitivity over that of growth-based assays and can detect agents that are active against bacteria in clinically relevant growth states that are difficult to screen using  conventional approaches, such as small colony variants (scv) and bacteria within  established biofilms. the usefulness of the ak assay was validated by screening a library of off-patent drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial properties toward a variety of bacterial species, including escherichia coli and all members of the "eskape" pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). the assay detected antibiotics within the library that were expected to be active against the organism screened. moreover, 38 drugs with no previously reported antibacterial activity elicited ak release. four of these  were acquired, and all were verified to exhibit antimicrobial activity by standard susceptibility testing. two of these molecules were further characterized. the antihistamine, terfenadine, was active against s. aureus planktonic, scv population, and biofilm-associated cells. tamoxifen, an estrogen  receptor antagonist, was active toward e. faecium in vitro and also reduced e. faecium pathogenesis in a galleria mellonella infection model. our data demonstrate that the ak assay provides an attractive screening approach for identifying new antimicrobial agents. further, terfenadine and tamoxifen may represent novel antimicrobial drug development scaffolds.

TI  == national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid) funding for studies  of hospital-associated bacterial pathogens: are funds proportionate to burden of  disease?
AB  == background: hospital-associated infections (hais) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. the pathogens that cause the majority of serious hais are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, referred as esckape. we aimed to determine the amount of funding the national institute of health (nih) national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly  esckape pathogens. methods: the nih research portfolio online reporting tools (report) database was used to identify niaid antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." results: funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. the total funding for all eskcape pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. s. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in fy2009, the highest funding amount of all the esckape pathogens. based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per s. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per c. difficile related death. conclusions: although the funding for esckape pathogens  has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.

TI  == synergistic effects between silver nanoparticles and antibiotics and the mechanisms involved.
AB  == silver nanoparticles (nano-ags), which have well-known antimicrobial properties,  are used extensively in various medical and general applications. in this study,  the combination effects between nano-ags and the conventional antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin against various pathogenic bacteria were investigated. the mic and fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) were determined to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects.  the results showed that nano-ags possessed antibacterial effects and synergistic  activities. the antibiofilm activities of nano-ags alone or in combination with antibiotics were also investigated. formation of biofilm is associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents and chronic bacterial infections. the results  indicated that nano-ags also had antibiofilm activities. to understand these effects of nano-ags, an atpase inhibitor assay, permeability assay and hydroxyl radical assay were conducted. the antibacterial activity of nano-ags was influenced by atp-associated metabolism rather than by the permeability of the outer membrane. additionally, nano-ags generated hydroxyl radicals, a highly reactive oxygen species induced by bactericidal agents. it was concluded that nano-ags have potential as a combination therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases by bacteria.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == total synthesis of marinomycin a using salicylate as a molecular switch to mediate dimerization.
AB  == antibiotics play a significant role in human health because of their ability to treat life-threatening bacterial infections. the growing problems with antibiotic resistance have made the development of new antibiotics a world health organization priority. marinomycin a is a member of a new class of bis-salicylate-containing polyene macrodiolides, which have potent antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. herein, we describe a triply convergent synthesis of this agent using the salicylate as a novel molecular switch for the chemoselective construction of the macrodiolide. this strategy raises new questions regarding the biosynthetic role of the salicylate and its potential impact on the mechanism of action of these types of agents. for instance, in contrast to penicillin, which enhances the electrophilicity of the cyclic amide through ring strain, salicylates reduce the electrophilicity of the  aryl ester through an intramolecular resonance-assisted hydrogen bond to provide  an amide surrogate.

TI  == novel model to study combined effects of microorganisms and oxidants on development of intestinal necrosis.
AB  == background: although the cause of intestinal necrosis in diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is multi-factorial, oxidants and bacteria likely  are key factors. many animal models of nec generate histologic necrosis, but it is rare to see the gross necrosis that is observed in infants. here, we present a novel model that produces full-thickness intestinal necrosis when chloramine-t, an oxidizing agent, is introduced directly into isolated intestinal loops. the aim of this study was to determine the role of bacteria in this model. methods: three-week-old mice underwent isolated ileal loop construction by suture ligation, and either chloramine-t or saline was injected into the loop. intestines were then returned to the abdominal cavity, and the incision was closed for 24 h, after which the intestinal loops were analyzed histologically and microbiologically. to determine if bacteria home to the site of injury, some  mice had intracecal injection of luminescent pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa). these mice were sacrificed 2, 6, 8, and 24 h later, and luminescent bacteria were localized via photon camera imaging. results: no gross necrosis was observed in the saline-treated group, but 59% of the animals in the chloramine-t-treated group had necrosis (p<0.001). relative bacterial species numbers were calculated  for untreated control animals and those with saline-treated loops and chloramine-t-treated loops without and with necrosis. lactobacillus was detected  in 60% of the control animals but was absent in all animals that underwent surgery. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, pa, and enterococcus faecium were present only in animals that underwent loop construction; however, bacterial communities did not differ according to loop treatment or the presence  or absence of necrosis. after intracecal injection of pa, bacteria homed to the loop and proximal bowel even though the loop was discontinuous with the remaining bowel. conclusions: intraluminal chloramine-t causes full-thickness necrosis in three-week-old mice and is characterized by a loss of probiotic bacteria such as  lactobacillus. necrotic loops of bowel become colonized rapidly with pathogenic bacteria by unconventional mechanisms. oxidant stress and colonization by pathogenic bacteria may play important roles in intestinal necrosis across a wide spectrum of pathologic states, including nec.

TI  == volatile organic compound analysis by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry for gram-positive bacteria differentiation.
AB  == approximately 50 % of all clinically proven infections in critically ill patients are caused by gram-positive bacteria. the timely and appropriate treatment of these infections is vital in order to avoid negative outcomes. hence, fast and reliable methods are needed for the early detection and identification of microorganisms. recently, direct mass spectrometry-based analysis of volatile organic compounds emitted by microorganisms has been employed to study gram-negative bacteria. here, we report a feasibility study of ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry (imr-ms) for in vitro growth detection and species differentiation of selected gram-positive bacteria that are frequently isolated in blood culture samples, namely, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry was used to analyze the headspace above cultures containing gram-positive bacteria incubated at 37 degrees c starting with 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. measurements to determine the presence of volatile organic compounds were performed 4, 8, and 24 h after incubation, respectively. the detection of microbial growth was accomplished already after 8 h in cultures  containing e. faecalis. after 24 h of incubation, characteristic mass spectra were obtained for all species. processing these mass spectra by hierarchic clustering and principal component analysis (pca) enabled us to differentiate between bacterial species. imr-ms in conjunction with a cumulative end-point model provides the means for rapid growth detection and differentiation of gram-positive bacteria on the species level, typically within an analysis time of less than 3 min per sample.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the us food and  drug administration (fda) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). after intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. because of its unique spectrum of activity, the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-mrsa activity. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. ceftaroline has low  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for all tested species of streptococci,  and has potent activity against s. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. the activity of ceftaroline is limited against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis. the in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class b metallo-beta-lactamases or ampc cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline  fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in phase iii randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. two identical trials (canvas 1 and canvas 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with csssi. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam  group (difference -1.1%, 95% ci -4.2, 2.0). an additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the fda guidance definition of absssi at treatment day 3. clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared  with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% ci 1.3, 14.0). clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with cap was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase iii trials (focus 1 and focus 2). of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against mrsa, patients with confirmed or suspected mrsa cap were excluded from the focus trials. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure  compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% ci 1.6, 11.8). an additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe cap and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. cabp). day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% ci -0.6, 20.6). in the phase iii trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant gram-positive pathogens, including mrsa, as well as many common gram-negative organisms. it is a welcome treatment option for absssi and cabp.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive pathogens in saudi arabia.
AB  == several species of gram-positive cocci are major nosocomial or community pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality. here, we review the antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens in saudi arabia. in the last decades, antimicrobial resistance has increased among staphylococcus aureus in the kingdom with a growing prevalence of both nosocomial and community methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates. as yet, no vancomycin-resistant  mrsa have been reported, although isolates with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been noted. currently, the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant entrococci (vre) is low; however, vre has been described in the kingdom as well as enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin, sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides. in recent decades, the prevalence and rate of penicillin resistance and non-susceptibility among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates have increased in saudi arabia. the organism remains, however, susceptible to other beta-lactams and to quinolones. on the other hand, resistance to co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines is high and resistance to macrolides is on the increase.

TI  == costs of healthcare- and community-associated infections with antimicrobial-resistant versus antimicrobial-susceptible organisms.
AB  == objective: we compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. methods: a retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in manhattan. the main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. results: controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [ci], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; ci, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; ci, 1.5-5.4). patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; ci, 0.01-0.08). conclusions: with careful  matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. the difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.

TI  == sesquiterpenes and cyclopeptides from the endophytic fungus trichoderma asperellum samuels, lieckf. & nirenberg.
AB  == trichodones a-c (1-3, resp.), three new sesquiterpenes, together with the two known cyclopeptides pf1022f and halobacillin (4 and 5, resp.), have been isolated from the crude extract of the endophytic fungus trichoderma asperellum samuels, lieckf. & nirenberg residing in the traditional chinese medicinal plant panax notoginseng (burkill) f.h.chen. the structures and configurations of compounds 1-3 were determined by nmr spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. the relative configuration for 1 was determined by analysis of its pertinent coupling constants and noesy correlations, whereas the absolute configuration of 1 was established by cd spectroscopy. compounds 4 and 5 displayed antibacterial activities against enterococcus faecium (cgmcc 1.2025) with ic(5)(0) values of 7.30 and 5.24 mum, and against staphylococcus aureus col (cgmcc 1.2465) with ic(5)(0) values of 19.02 and 14.00 mum, respectively.

TI  == exploration of the chemical space of novel naphthalene-sulfonamide and anthranilic acid-based inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == penicillin-binding proteins are a well established, validated and still a very promising target for the design and development of new antibacterial agents. based on our previous discovery of several noncovalent small-molecule inhibitor hits for resistant pbps we decided to additionally explore the chemical space around these compounds. in order to clarify their structure-activity relationships for pbp inhibition two new series of compounds were synthesized, characterized and evaluated biochemically: the derivatives of anthranilic acid and naphthalene-sulfonamide derivatives. the target compounds were tested for their inhibitory activities on three different transpeptidases: pbp2a from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains, pbp5fm from enterococcus faecium strains, and pbp1b from streptococcus pneumoniae strains. the most promising results for both of these series of compounds were obtained against the pbp2a enzyme with the ic50 values in the micromolar range. although these results do not represent a significant breakthrough in the field of noncovalent pbp inhibitors, they do provide useful structure-activity relationship data, and thus a more solid basis for the design of potent and noncovalent inhibitors of resistant pbps.

TI  == examining the fish microbiome: vertebrate-derived bacteria as an environmental niche for the discovery of unique marine natural products.
AB  == historically, marine invertebrates have been a prolific source of unique natural  products, with a diverse array of biological activities. recent studies of invertebrate-associated microbial communities are revealing microorganisms as the true producers of many of these compounds. inspired by the human microbiome project, which has highlighted the human intestine as a unique microenvironment in terms of microbial diversity, we elected to examine the bacterial communities  of fish intestines (which we have termed the fish microbiome) as a new source of  microbial and biosynthetic diversity for natural products discovery. to test the  hypothesis that the fish microbiome contains microorganisms with unique capacity  for biosynthesizing natural products, we examined six species of fish through a combination of dissection and culture-dependent evaluation of intestinal microbial communities. using isolation media designed to enrich for marine actinobacteria, we have found three main clades that show taxonomic divergence from known strains, several of which are previously uncultured. extracts from these strains exhibit a wide range of activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens, as well as several fish pathogens. exploration of  one of these extracts has identified the novel bioactive lipid sebastenoic acid as an anti-microbial agent, with activity against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and vibrio mimicus.

TI  == bacteribilia with resistant microorganisms after preoperative biliary drainage--the influence of bacteria on postoperative outcome.
AB  == background: in pancreatic surgery, preoperative biliary drainage (pbd) leads to bacteribilia. whether positive bile duct cultures are associated with a higher postoperative morbidity might be related to the resistance of the species isolated from bile. study: intraoperative bile duct cultures were collected from  all patients who underwent pancreatic surgery. postoperative morbidity was analyzed according to the species and the resistance found on bile duct cultures. results: fifty-five percent (166/301) of patients had pbd, while 45% (135/301) underwent primary operation. pbd was associated with a positive bile duct culture in 87% (144/166) versus 21% (28/135) in patients without pbd (p = 0.001) and polymicrobial infections in 53% (88/166) versus 6% (8/135) (p = 0.001). postoperative morbidity was 40% (121/301); mortality was 3% (9/301). pbd was not  associated with morbidity and mortality, but resistant species on bile duct cultures lead to significantly more postoperative complications, 54% (25/46) versus 38% (96/255) (p = 0.033), with significantly more antibiotic therapies. conclusion: pbd is associated with polymicrobial infections with resistant microorganisms, resulting in more postoperative complications. since pbd cannot always be avoided, surgeons and gastroenterologists must be aware of their institutional surveillance data to identify patients at risk for postoperative complications.

TI  == transferable plasmid-mediated resistance to linezolid due to cfr in a human clinical isolate of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == nonmutational resistance to linezolid is due to the presence of cfr, which encodes a methyltransferase responsible for methylation of a2503 in the 23s rrna. the cfr gene was first described in animal isolates of staphylococci, and more recently, it has been identified in staphylococcus aureus from human clinical infections, including in an outbreak of methicillin-resistant s. aureus. in enterococci, cfr has been described in an animal isolate of enterococcus faecalis from china. here, we report an isolate of linezolid-resistant e. faecalis (603-50427x) recovered from a patient in thailand who received prolonged therapy  with the antibiotic for the treatment of atypical mycobacterial disease. the isolate lacked mutations in the genes coding for 23s rrna and l3 and l4 ribosomal proteins and belonged to the multilocus sequence type (mlst) 16 (st16), which is  commonly found in enterococcal isolates from animal sources. resistance to linezolid was associated with the presence of cfr on an ~97-kb transferable plasmid. the cfr gene environment exhibited dna sequences similar to those of other cfr-carrying plasmids previously identified in staphylococci (nucleotide identity, 99 to 100%). the cfr-carrying plasmid was transferable by conjugation to a laboratory strain of e. faecalis (og1rf) but not to enterococcus faecium or  s. aureus. the cfr gene was flanked by is256-like sequences both upstream and downstream. this is the first characterization of the potential horizontal transferability of the cfr gene from a human linezolid-resistant isolate of e. faecalis.

TI  == epidemiological features and risk factors of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in  intensive care unit patients: 2008-2011.
AB  == background: encephalopathy is a common complication of sepsis, and its onset can  occur at any stage of sepsis and implies worse prognosis. however, the incidence, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy remain controversial. the purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiological features and risk factors for sepsis-associated encephalopathy. methods: our retrospective study included all patients with sepsis admitted to our intensive care unit from 2008 to 2011. after excluding 91 patients, 232 patients were assigned to either a sepsis-associated encephalopathy group or sepsis without encephalopathy group. between-group differences in baseline patient data including vital signs, disease severity, pathogens, sites of infection, biochemical indicators, and time on a mechanical ventilator, intensive care unit  (icu) stay, and 28-day mortality rate were analyzed. results: the incidence of sepsis-associated encephalopathy was 17.7%. the sepsis-associated encephalopathy  group had significantly higher 28-day mortality (56.1% vs. 35.1%; p=0.013), spent a significantly longer time on a ventilator ((8.2+/-2.2) days vs. (2.9+/-0.4) days; p=0.021), and had a significantly longer icu stay ((12.4+/-2.4) days vs. (7.1+/-0.6) days; p=0.042). acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score, glasgow coma scale, heart rate, blood lactate, serum sodium, platelets, serum albumin, and ph values were related to the presence of encephalopathy. patients with biliary tract infections and intestinal infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, acinetobacter spp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were more prone to develop sepsis-associated encephalopathy. conclusions: encephalopathy increases mortality rate in septic patients. clinical intervention to reduce risk factors and thereby morbidity and mortality depends on a correct understanding of the differences between patients with sepsis and patients with both sepsis and encephalopathy.

TI  == evaluation of standard- and high-dose daptomycin versus linezolid against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus isolates in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  == daptomycin mics for enterococci are typically 1- to 2-fold higher than those for  staphylococcus aureus, and there is an imminent need to establish the optimal dose for appropriate treatment of enterococcal infections. we investigated the bactericidal activity of daptomycin at various dose exposures compared to that of linezolid against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model utilizing simulated endocardial vegetations over 96 h. daptomycin at doses of 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg of body weight/day and linezolid at a dose of 600 mg every 12 h were evaluated against two clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium strains (efm11499 and 09-184d1051), one of which was linezolid resistant (09-184d1051), and one clinical vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis strain (efs11496). daptomycin mics were 4, 2, and 0.5 mug/ml for efm11499, 09-184d1051, and efs11496, respectively.  bactericidal activity, defined as a >/= 3 log(10) cfu/g reduction from the initial colony count, was demonstrated against all three isolates with all doses  of daptomycin; however, bactericidal activity was not sustained with the daptomycin 6- and 8-mg/kg/day regimens. linezolid was bacteriostatic against efm11499 and displayed no appreciable activity against 09-184d1051 or efs11496. concentration-dependent killing was displayed with more sustained reduction in colony count (3.58 to 6.46 and 5.89 to 6.56 log(10) cfu/g) at 96 h for the simulated regimen of daptomycin at doses of 10 and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively (p  </= 0.012). no e. faecium mutants with reduced susceptibility were recovered at any dosage regimen; however, the e. faecalis strain developed reduced daptomycin  susceptibility with daptomycin at 6, 8, and 10 but not at 12 mg/kg/day. daptomycin displayed a dose-dependent response against three vre isolates, with high-dose daptomycin producing sustained bactericidal activity. further research  is warranted.

TI  == persistence of nosocomial pathogens on various fabrics.
AB  == objective: fabrics can become contaminated with high numbers of microorganisms that may be pathogenic to patients in a hospital setting and can play an important role in the chain of infection. the aim of this study was to investigate the survival of several clinical bacterial and fungal isolates on several fabrics commonly used in hospitals. materials and methods: bacterial and  fungal survival was tested on the following materials, each of which are commonly used in our hospital: 100% smooth cotton, 60% cotton-40% polyester, 100% wool and 100% silk. one isolate each of candida albicans, candida tropicalis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida parapsilosis, geotrichum candidum, aspergillus  fumigatus, cryptococcus neoformans, vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium (vre, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) positive escherichia coli, inducible beta-lactamase (ibl) positive pseudomonas aeruginosa, ibl-positive acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were used to contaminate fabrics. the survival of these microorganisms was studied by testing the fabric swatches for microbial growth. results: the median survival times for all the tested bacteria and fungi  were as follows: 26 days on cotton, 26.5 days on cotton-polyester, 28 days on silk, and 30 days on wool. among the bacterial species tested, e. faecium had the longest survival time on cotton-polyester fabrics. for the fungal isolates, it was observed that c. tropicalis and c. krusei survived for the shortest amount of time on cotton fabrics in the present study. conclusion: this survival data indicate that pathogenic microorganisms can survive from days to months on commonly used hospital fabrics. these findings indicate that current recommendations for the proper disinfection or sterilization of fabrics used in hospitals should be followed to minimize cross-contamination and prevent nosocomial infections.

AB  == background: vancomycin is often the drug of choice in critically ill patients with gram-positive infections, although circumstances often prevent its use. in these situations, clinicians are frequently left with limited data regarding alternative agents. objective: to describe patients with reported sepsis receiving daptomycin in a critical care unit. methods: this multicenter, noncomparative, noninterventional study identified patients in critical care units, using the cubicin outcomes registry and experience (core) 2005-2009 registry. a descriptive account of patient characteristics, infectious etiology,  outcomes at the end of daptomycin therapy, and 30-day mortality is reported. nonevaluable patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis but included in the safety analysis. results: we identified 128 patients, 98 (77%) of whom were evaluable for efficacy. patient characteristics for the efficacy population were  55 (56%) males, 30 (31%) aged 66 years or older, 38 (39%) had creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min, and 27 (28%) were on dialysis. common underlying diseases included acute or chronic renal failure 44 (45%), hypertension 40 (41%), and diabetes 27 (28%). seventy-two (73%) patients were bacteremic. the most common pathogens found were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (32%), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (21%), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (20%). prior to daptomycin, antibiotics were used in 84 (86%) patients, most commonly vancomycin (65/84; 77%). the median (range) initial daptomycin dose was 6 mg/kg (3-10) and duration of 10 days (1-58). overall success rate was 70% (31% cured; 39% improved). twelve adverse events possibly related to daptomycin were reported in 9 of 128 (7%) patients in the safety population; 4 of these in 4 (3%) patients were serious. the mortality rate within 30 days of completing daptomycin was 42 of 128 (33%) patients. conclusions: these data provide preliminary results on the use of daptomycin in critically ill patients with complicated conditions. controlled studies are needed to best evaluate daptomycin use in these patients.

TI  == oritavancin: mechanism of action.
AB  == oritavancin is a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide analogue of vancomycin that contains the heptapeptide core common to all glycopeptides. it differs from vancomycin by the presence of a hydrophobic n-4-(4-chlorophenyl)benzyl (also referred to as 4'-chlorobiphenylmethyl) substituent on the disaccharide sugar, the addition of a 4-epi-vancosamine monosaccharide to the amino acid residue in ring 6, and the replacement of the vancosamine moiety by 4-epi-vancosamine. one mechanism of action of oritavancin is inhibition of transglycosylation (important in peptidoglycan synthesis) by binding to d-alanyl-d-alanine stem termini in gram-positive bacteria. the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis via inhibition  of transglycosylation is common to all glycopeptides (vancomycin) and lipoglycopeptides. secondary binding of oritavancin to the pentaglycyl (asp/asn)  bridging segment in peptidoglycan also occurs, which distinguishes it from vancomycin and contributes to oritavancin's activity versus vancomycin-resistant  organisms. the presence of the hydrophobic 4'-chlorobiphenylmethyl group allows for interaction and disruption of the cell membrane, resulting in depolarization, permeabilization, and concentration-dependent, rapid cell death. this mechanism is shared with telavancin but not vancomycin and results in activity against daptomycin-nonsusceptible organisms. in conclusion, oritavancin's mechanism of action involves at least 3 known mechanisms: inhibition of transglycosylation, inhibition of transpeptidation, and cell membrane interaction/disruption. oritavancin's multiple mechanisms of action confer activity against vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant organisms, as well as rapid, concentration-dependent killing versus actively growing, stationary phase, and biofilm-producing gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from farmed seabass dicentrarchus labrax.
AB  == the use of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing attention. in the present study, 47 lab strains  were isolated from farmed seabass ( dicentrarchus labrax ) and were phenotypically and phylogenetically analysed by 16s rdna and randomly amplified polymorphic dna - polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). their antimicrobial effect was tested in vitro against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. most of the strains isolated were enterococci belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecium (59%), enterococcus faecalis (21%), enterococcus sanguinicola (4 strains), enterococcus mundtii (1 strain), enterococcus pseudoavium (1 strain), and lactococcus lactis (1 strain). an aerococcus viridans strain was also isolated. the survey of their antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal medicine. different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and intestines isolates. more than 69% (32 strains) of the isolates inhibited the growth of the majority of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested,  including listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas salmonicida, vibrio anguillarum, and carnobacterium sp. to our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactive enterococcal species isolated from seabass that could potentially inhibit the undesirable bacteria found in food systems.

TI  == action of linezolid or vancomycin on biofilms in ventriculoperitoneal shunts in vitro.
AB  == cerebrospinal fluid (csf) shunts used to treat hydrocephalus have an overall infection rate of about 10% of operations. the commonest causative bacteria are staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. major difficulties are encountered with nonsurgical treatment due to biofilm development in the shunt tubing and inability to achieve sufficiently high csf drug levels by intravenous administration. recently, three cases of s. epidermidis csf shunt infection have been treated by intravenous linezolid without surgical shunt removal, and we therefore investigated vancomycin and linezolid against biofilms of these bacteria in vitro. a continuous-perfusion model of shunt catheter biofilms was used to establish mature (1-week) biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis (both methicillin resistant  [mrsa and mrse]), enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. they were then "treated" with either vancomycin or linezolid in concentrations achievable in csf for 14 days. the biofilms were then monitored for 1 week for eradication and for  regrowth. enterococcal biofilms were not eradicated by either vancomycin or linezolid. staphylococcal biofilms were eradicated by both antibiotics after 2 days and did not regrow. no resistance was seen. linezolid at concentrations achievable by intravenous or oral administration was able to eradicate biofilms of both s. epidermidis (mrse) and s. aureus (mrsa). neither vancomycin at concentrations achievable by intrathecal administration nor linezolid was able to eradicate enterococcal biofilms. it is hoped that these in vitro results will stimulate further clinical trials with linezolid, avoiding surgical shunt removal.

AB  == enterococci are a frequent cause of nosocomial infections in gastroenterology. the increase of enterococcus faecium infections with development of resistance to gentamicin and vancomycin as well as possible linezolid resistance require alternative antibiotic therapies. study data show that daptomycin, a highly bactericidal antibiotic is effective in enterococcal infections. however, in germany daptomycin is so far only approved for the treatment of complicated skin  and soft tissue infections, bacteremia and infective endocarditis caused by staphylococcus aureus. in the department of internal medicine i, university hospital halle (saale) from may 2 009 to april 2 010 all gastroenterological patients with evidence of invasive enterococcal infection received intravenous daptomycin treatment at inclusion in the european cubicin(r) outcomes registry and experience (eu-core). gastroenterological diseases treated were necrotising pancreatitis, infected pancreatic pseudocysts, abscesses, obstructive cholangitis and sepsis. the clinical outcome was retrospectively detected by protocol-defined criteria. a total of 13 patients (8 male, 5 female, median age 59 years) with microbiologically assured enterococcal infections (10 x e. faecium, including 1 x vre, 6 x e. faecalis, including double infections) were treated with intravenous  daptomycin (6 mg per kg body weight). in the presence of polymicrobial infections (10 of 13 patients), an additional anti-infective therapy was initiated according to sensitivity testing. concomitantly a direct focus approach with stenting, puncture or drainage was performed. the clinical cure rate was 92 % (12 of 13 patients). one patient died from a non-surgically uncontrollable malignancy (klatskin tumour bismuth iiib). there were no adverse events. these results allow us to conclude that antibiotic therapy with daptomycin in invasive or bacteraemic enterococcal infections leads to high cure rates (up to 90 % and more) when concomitant and adequate focus relief is performed. larger clinical studies to obtain an extended drug approval are desirable.

TI  == minim typing--a rapid and low cost mlst based typing tool for klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) based genotyping method for klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (mlst) loci. the approach is termed mini-mlst or minim typing and it has previously been applied to streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. six snps  were derived from concatenated mlst sequences on the basis of maximisation of the simpsons index of diversity (d). dna fragments incorporating these snps and predicted to be suitable for hrm analysis were designed. using the assumption that hrm alleles are defined by g+c content, minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a d = 0.979 against known sts. the method was tested against 202 k. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the mlst analyses were performed after the hrm analyses. the hrm-based alleles were indeed in accordance with g+c content, and the minim typing identified known sts and flagged new sts.  the tonb mlst locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. however these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonb gene (d = 0.929), and the other using hrm data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonb mlst fragment (d = 0.995). the hrm assays were developed on the rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the lightcycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. the assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current mlst data. minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by eskape organisms: cause, clinical features, and management.
AB  == purpose of review: despite important geographical variations, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) episodes. their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on icu patients' outcome. this review updates information on vap due to eskape pathogens. recent findings: although methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus vap may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. local  colonization determines treatment options. the contribution of tracheobronchitis  is an important issue. minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for  nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria vap to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by eskape pathogens. summary: vap due to eskape pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity.

TI  == a simple method for primary screening of antibacterial peptides in plant seeds.
AB  == background and objectives: regarding the importance of finding new antibacterial  drugs, screening of plants as a promising resource are now conducted worldwide. in this study, we report the application of a simple previously described method  for screening of different plant seeds in order to find the best resources of plant antimicrobial peptides. materials and methods: total water soluble protein  of 10 different plant seeds were extracted and subjected to sds-page and subsequent agar-overlay bioassays. standard strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium and escherichia coli were included in the bioassays. this method also was used for total proteins precipitated by ammonium sulphate which ensure the protein nature of the test substances. molecular size and the amounts  of effective peptides were estimated using tricin-sds-page and densitometry. results: two different plant seeds showed noticeable antibacterial activities against tested gram positive bacteria and a moderate inhibitory effect on gram negative ones. based on the results of tricin-sds-page analysis which were carried out in parallel to bioassays, it was concluded that effective antibacterial substances are peptides with molecular weight of slightly larger than 5 kda. conclusion: on the basis of results of agar-overlay experiments and by screening of 10 different herbal seeds, we could introduce seeds of m. sativa  l. and onobrychis sativa lam., as great sources of putative plant antibacterial peptides. the proposed screening method can be used for screening of large number of different plant seeds and even other parts of the plant body, regarding some necessary modification in total water soluble protein extraction steps.

TI  == mechanism of honey bacteriostatic action against mrsa and vre involves hydroxyl radicals generated from honey's hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == it has been recently reported that honey hydrogen peroxide in conjunction with unknown honey components produced cytotoxic effects resulting in bacterial growth inhibition and dna degradation. the objective of this study was twofold: (a) to investigate whether the coupling chemistry involving hydrogen peroxide is responsible for a generation of hydroxyl radicals and (b) whether (*)oh generation affects growth of multi-drug resistant clinical isolates. the susceptibility of five different strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus (mrsa) and four strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) isolates from infected wounds to several honeys was evaluated using broth microdilution assay. isolates were identified to genus and species and their susceptibility to antibiotics was confirmed using an automated system (vitek((r)), biomerieux((r))). the presence of the mec(a) gene, nuc gene and van(a) and (b) genes were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. results showed  that no clinical isolate was resistant to selected active honeys. the median difference in honeys mics against these strains ranged between 12.5 and 6.25% v/v and was not different from the mic against standard escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. generation of (*)oh during bacteria incubation with honeys was analyzed using 3'-(p-aminophenyl) fluorescein (apf) as the (*)oh trap. the (*)oh participation in growth inhibition was monitored directly by including apf in broth microdilution assay. the growth of mrsa and vre was inhibited by (*)oh generation in a dose-dependent manner. exposure of mrsa and vre to honeys supplemented with cu(ii) augmented production of (*)oh by 30-fold and increased honey bacteriostatic potency from mic(90) 6.25 to mic(90)< 0.78% v/v. pretreatment of honeys with catalase prior to their supplementation with cu ions  fully restored bacterial growth indicating that hydroxyl radicals were produced from h(2)o(2) via the fenton-type reaction. in conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that bacteriostatic effect of honeys on mrsa and vre was dose-dependently related to generation of (*)oh from honey h(2)o(2).

TI  == reversal of antibiotic resistance in gram-positive bacteria by the antihistaminic azelastine.
AB  == antibiotic resistance represents a serious problem that complicates microbial infection. the use of 'helper compounds' capable of enhancing the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics is being investigated. azelastine, a new generation antihistaminic, possesses certain antibacterial activity and is capable of inducing alteration in the bacterial membrane permeability. hence, we hypothesized that it could reverse resistance to antibiotics. azelastine significantly increased the antibacterial activity of eight antibiotics belonging to five different classes (beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and tetracyclines) against nine gram-positive clinical isolates:  five staphylococcus aureus, two staphylococcus epidermidis and two enterococcus faecium, seven of which were multi-drug resistant, reversing their resistance to  the tested antibiotics. the synergistic effects of azelastine with the studied antibiotics increased with raising the ph from 5 to 8. antibiotics did not affect the ability of azelastine to alter the permeability of a liposomal artificial membrane model, an effect thought to be critical for the interaction with antibiotics. the findings of this study present azelastine as a potential 'helper compound' that could reverse the resistance of multi-drug resistant gram-positive clinical isolates to antibiotics.

TI  == [microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
AB  == aim: development of methodical approach of evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis. materials and methods: 9 bifidobacteria cultures (dominants) and 18 opportunistic microorganism strains (associants) isolated from patients during examination for intestine dysbiosis and identified by conventional methods were used. evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis was performed by author developed technique that is based on determination of growth factors (gf), anti-lysozyme activity (ala) and formation of biofilms (bff) of associants co-incubated with exometabolites of dominants. gf, ala, bff were studied photometrically (bukharin o.v., 1999, 2009; o'toole g.a., 2000). the data were statistically analyzed by fisher-student criteria. results: the detected opposite (increase/reduction) phenomenon of the "dominant-associant" pair allowed realization of the "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis. associants  (e. coli and enterococcus faecium) were "friend" species, in which bifidobacteria exometabolites did not change growth properties and stimulated ala (by 17,5--32%) and bff (by 25 - 39%). associants (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans) were "foe" microsymbiont species, in which bifidoflora exometabolites decreased gf (by 20,7--68%), ala (by 22,7--54%)  and bff (by 22,5 --39%). conclusion: indigenous microflora during microsymbiocenosis formation can participate in "friend-foe" identification, the  basis of which is determined by microsymbiont exometabolites. the data obtained open a perspective of understanding mechanisms of intramicrobial interactions and can be used for both diagnostics and optimal selection of "candidates" during creation of new probiotics and synbiotics.

TI  == novel vancomycin-resistance transposon, plasmid replicon types, and virulence factors of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in zhejiang, china.
AB  == forty-seven vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains were isolated from clinical samples in 13 zhejiang hospitals and fecal samples from icu patients in  a large teaching hospital in china. no vre isolates were detected in healthy human subjects. cc17 was the main clonal complex in clinical enterococcus faecium isolates but not in isolates from healthy human subjects. novel vancomycin-resistance transposons were detected among vre strains. this is the first report demonstrating insertion of tnpa and fosb genes in the vanrs-vanh intergenic region of tn1546 leading to coresistance to vancomycin and fosfomycin. the four plasmid replicon types (prum, pre25, pef418, and pb82) were more common  in vre isolates, suggesting their association with vancomycin resistance and nosocomial transmission. the prevalence rate of vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus-related inc18-like plasmid, pip501, in vre was 21.3%. the prevalence of the esp gene among vre isolates was high (76.6%). in several vre strains, the esp and hyl genes were cotransferred with the vana gene by conjugation. although the frequency of vre is low in chinese hospitals, its association with virulence determinants, the vancomycin-resistance transposon with other resistance gene insertions or plasmids may lead to multidrug resistance and the evolution of pathogenic vre.

TI  == an n-halamine-based rechargeable antimicrobial and biofilm controlling polyurethane.
AB  == an n-halamine precursor, 5,5-dimethylhydantoin (dmh), was covalently linked to the surface of polyurethane (pu) with 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (hdi) as the coupling agent. the reaction pathways were investigated using propyl isocyanate (pi) as a model compound. the results suggested that the imide and amide groups of dmh have very similar reactivities toward the isocyanate groups on pu surfaces activated with hdi. after bleach treatment the covalently bound dmh moieties were transformed into n-halamines. the new n-halamine-based pu provided potent antimicrobial effects against staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive bacterium), escherichia coli (gram-negative bacterium), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus (mrsa, drug-resistant gram-positive bacterium), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre, drug-resistant gram-positive bacterium), and candida albicans (fungus), and successfully prevented bacterial and fungal biofilm formation. the antimicrobial and biofilm controlling effects were stable for longer than 6 months under normal storage in open air. furthermore, if the functions were lost due to prolonged use they could be recharged by another chlorination treatment. the recharging could be repeated as needed to achieve long-term protection against microbial contamination and biofilm formation.

TI  == studies on the biosynthesis of the lipodepsipeptide antibiotic ramoplanin a2.
AB  == ramoplanin, a non-ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotic, is highly effective against several drug-resistant gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), two important opportunistic human pathogens. recently, the biosynthetic cluster from the ramoplanin producer actinoplanes atcc 33076 was sequenced, revealing an unusual architecture of fatty acid and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic genes (nrpss). the first steps towards understanding how these biosynthetic enzymes cooperatively interact to produce the depsipeptide product are expression and isolation of each enzyme to probe its specificity and function. here we describe the successful production of soluble enzymes from within the ramoplanin locus and the confirmation of their specific role in biosynthesis. these methods may be broadly applicable to the production of biosynthetic enzymes from other natural product biosynthetic gene clusters, especially those that have been refractory to production in heterologous hosts despite standard expression optimization methods.

TI  == prevalence and risk factors of infections by multiresistant bacteria in cirrhosis: a prospective study.
AB  == epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical effect of infections by multiresistant bacteria in cirrhosis are poorly known. this work was a prospective evaluation in two series of cirrhotic patients admitted with infection or developing infection  during hospitalization. the first series was studied between 2005 and 2007 (507 bacterial infections in 223 patients) and the second between 2010 and 2011 (162 bacterial infections in 110 patients). in the first series, 32% of infections were community acquired (ca), 32% healthcare associated (hca), and 36% nosocomial. multiresistant bacteria (92 infections; 18%) were isolated in 4%, 14%, and 35% of these infections, respectively (p < 0.001). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esbl-e; n = 43) was the main multiresistant organism identified, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 17),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n = 14), and enterococcus faecium (n = 14). the efficacy of currently recommended empirical antibiotic therapy was very low in nosocomial infections (40%), compared to hca and ca episodes (73% and 83%, respectively; p < 0.0001), particularly in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia (26%, 29%, and 44%, respectively). septic shock (26% versus 10%; p < 0.0001) and mortality rate (25%  versus 12%; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in infections caused by multiresistant strains. nosocomial origin of infection (hazard ratio [hr], 4.43), long-term norfloxacin prophylaxis (hr, 2.69), recent infection by multiresistant  bacteria (hr, 2.45), and recent use of beta-lactams (hr, 2.39) were independently associated with the development of multiresistant infections. results in the second series were similar to those observed in the first series. conclusions: multiresistant bacteria, especially esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, are frequently isolated in nosocomial and, to a lesser extent, hca infections in cirrhosis, rendering third-generation cephalosporins clinically ineffective. new  antibiotic strategies tailored according to the local epidemiological patterns are needed for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections in cirrhosis.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

AB  == the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist) study, initiated in 2006,  is a nationwide surveillance program designed to longitudinally monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered drug-resistant bacteria. this study compared the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 3,014  isolates of clinically important drug-resistant bacteria using the standard broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 759), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre; n = 191), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 602), esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 736), and acinetobacter baumannii (n = 726) that had been collected from patients treated between 2008 and 2010 at 20 hospitals in taiwan. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted according to the currently recommended u.s. food and drug administration (fda) criteria and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria. the mic(90) values of tigecycline against mrsa, vre, esbl-producing e. coli, esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, and a. baumannii were 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. the total error rates between the two methods using the fda criteria were high: 38.4% for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and 33.8% for a. baumannii. using the eucast criteria, the total error rate was also high (54.6%) for a. baumannii isolates. the total error rates between these two methods were <5% for mrsa, vre, and esbl-producing e. coli. for routine susceptibility testing of esbl-producing  k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii against tigecycline, the broth microdilution method should be used because of the poor correlation of results between these two methods.

AB  == the dynamics of isolation of staphylococci and enterococci from clinical material of patients and their antibiotic susceptibility within a 5-year period (2005-2009) was analysed. 5990 isolates were tested: 1250 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 3268 isolates of s. epidermidis, 1005 isolates of enterococcus faecalis and 467 isolates of e. faecium. grampositive infections were shown to be prevailing within the last 2-3 years, the nosocomial epidermal staphylococci more and more replacing s. aureus (the ratio of s. epidermidis and  s. aureus in 2009 was 3.3). the isolation rate of e. faecalis significantly increased (by 3.5 times) and the ratio of e. faecalis and e. faecium in 2009 was  4.3. the microflora composition with respect to the isolation source was analysed and its clinical significance was estimated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that oxacillin had its own specific niche, while antibiotics active against resistant grampositive cocci, such as rifampicin, fusidic acid, fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin), cefoxitin, as well as amoxicillin/clavulane in infections due to e. faecalis, might be considered as the drugs of choice. in the treatment of nosocomial infections, when the etiological role of mrsa or vre is suspected or confirmed, the complex therapy should obligatory include the most active antibiotics (vancomycin or linezolid among them).

TI  == improved antibiotic-impregnated catheters with extended-spectrum activity against resistant bacteria and fungi.
AB  == minocycline-rifampin-impregnated central venous catheters (m/r cvcs) have been shown to be efficacious in reducing catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsi) and inhibiting the biofilm adherence of resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. to expand the spectrum of antimicrobial activity, a novel second-generation  m/r catheter was developed by adding chlorhexidine (chx-m/r). cvcs and peripherally inserted central catheters (piccs) were impregnated with chx-m/r and compared with first-generation m/r catheters, chx-silver sulfadiazine-treated cvcs (chx/ss-cvcs), chlorhexidine-treated piccs, and uncoated catheters. a biofilm catheter colonization model was used to assess the efficacy of catheters  against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant  enterococcus faecium (vre), p. aeruginosa, candida albicans, and candida glabrata. chx-m/r-impregnated cvcs were the only antimicrobial catheters that completely inhibited the biofilm colonization of all resistant bacterial and fungal organisms tested at all time intervals, and they were significantly superior to uncoated catheters (all p values were </=0.003). furthermore, chx-m/r-coated cvcs had a significantly more effective and prolonged (up to 3 weeks) antimicrobial activity against mrsa and p. aeruginosa than m/r, chx/ss, and uncoated cvcs (p < 0.0001). similarly, chx-m/r-coated piccs were also superior to m/r-coated and chx-coated piccs in preventing biofilms of mrsa, vre,  p. aeruginosa, and candida species (p value = 0.003 for all). our study shows that novel chx-m/r-coated catheters have unique properties in completely inhibiting biofilm colonization of mrsa, vre, p. aeruginosa, and fungi in a manner superior to that of m/r- and chlorhexidine-treated catheters.

TI  == mechanistic analysis of muraymycin analogues: a guide to the design of mray inhibitors.
AB  == the systematic structure-activity relationship (sar) of the muraymycins (mrys) using an ugi four-component reaction (u4cr) was investigated. the impact of the lipophilic substituent on antibacterial activity was significant, and the analogues 8 and 9 having a lipophilic side chain exhibited good activity against  a range of gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including mrsa and vre. further investigation of compounds 8 and 9 revealed these analogues to be selective inhibitors of the mray transferase and nontoxic to hepg2 cells. the sar of the accessory urea-peptide moiety indicated that it could be simplified. our sar study of the mrys suggests a probable mechanism for inhibition of the mray, where the inner moiety of the urea-dipeptide motif interacts with the carbohydrate recognition domain in the cytoplasmic loop 5. the predicted binding model would provide further direction toward the design of potent mray inhibitors. this study has set the stage for the generation of novel antibacterial "lead" compounds based on mrys.

TI  == engineered biosynthesis of glycosylated derivatives of narbomycin and evaluation  of their antibacterial activities.
AB  == a 14-membered macrolide antibiotic narbomycin produced from streptomyces venezuelae atcc 15439 is composed of polyketide macrolactone ring and d-desosamine as a deoxysugar moiety, which acts as an important determinant of its antibacterial activity. in order to generate diverse glycosylated derivatives of narbomycin, expression plasmids carrying different deoxysugar biosynthetic gene cassettes and the gene encoding a substrate-flexible glycosyltransferase desvii were constructed and introduced into s. venezuelae yj003 mutant strain bearing a deletion of thymidine-5'-diphospho-d-desosamine biosynthetic gene cluster. the resulting recombinants of s. venezuelae produced a range of new analogs of narbomycin, which possess unnatural sugar moieties instead of native deoxysugar d-desosamine. the structures of narbomycin derivatives were determined through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry analyses and their antibacterial activities were evaluated in vitro against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. substitution with l-rhamnose or 3-o-demethyl-d-chalcose was demonstrated  to exhibit greater antibacterial activity than narbomycin and the clinically relevant erythromycin. this work provides new insight into the functions of deoxysugar biosynthetic enzymes and structure-activity relationships of the sugar moieties attached to the macrolides and demonstrate the potential of combinatorial biosynthesis for the generation of new macrolides carrying diverse  sugars with increased antibacterial activities.

TI  == high-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == first detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk and the dfrk-carrying transposon tn559 in enterococci.
AB  == the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage  was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.

TI  == increase of patients co-colonised or co-infected with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == purpose: to determine the incidence of patients co-colonised or co-infected with  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae in four german tertiary care hospitals. methods: this study was conducted at four tertiary care hospitals (all with >1,000 beds) in different geographic regions in germany (berlin in the east, luebeck in the north, freiburg in the southwest and nuernberg in the southeast). routine surveillance data on mrsa, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and esbl-producing bacteria were analysed from 2007 to 2009. co-colonisation or co-infection was defined as a patient having positive cultures for at least two of the following resistant pathogens: mrsa, vre faecium or different species of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae within one calendar year. results: a total of 896,822 patients were analysed, of which 10,066 patients harboured mrsa, vre faecium and/or esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, and 542 patients co-harboured at least two of  those resistant pathogens. in 2009, 7.6% of the mrsa patients, 13.7% of the vre faecium patients and even 16.1% of the esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae patients were co-colonised or co-infected. the incidence of patients with co-infection or  co-colonisation increased steadily from 5 (2007) to 7 per 10,000 patients (2009). conclusions: patients harbouring esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae or vre faecium had a higher risk of being co-colonised or co-infected compared to what was to be extrapolated from their overall incidence. this might be linked to their gastrointestinal reservoir and impracticality to decolonise the gut of resistant  vre and esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == effect of antibiotic diversity on ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by eskape organisms.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to test in the clinic whether antimicrobial diversity affects resistance of enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella species, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). methods: three different strategies of empirical antimicrobial prescription for vap were consecutively implemented in an icu: patient specific (10 months); scheduling, including sequential quarterly prioritization (12 months) and restriction (12 months) of antimicrobials; and mixing (10 months). periods were compared, measuring the antimicrobial heterogeneity index (ahi). incidence and resistance patterns of vap caused by eskape were compared. results: overall, 127  microbiologic vap episodes were documented. eskape vap increased significantly during scheduling (ahi, 0.65) compared with patient-specific (ahi, 0.88) and mixing (ahi, 0.87) periods (relative risk, 2.67 and 3.84, respectively). this finding was associated with a significant (p < .05) increase of carbapenem-resistant a baumannii during the scheduling period (15.0%) compared with the patient-specific (2.4%) and mixing (0%) periods. icu mortality of resistant patients with eskape vap was doubled that of patients without eskape vap (relative risk, 2.25; 95% ci, 1.67-9.48). thirty-day mechanical ventilation-free days was significantly increased (5 days) in patients with resistant eskape vap. conclusions: antibiotic strategies promoting diversity may  prevent the emergence of resistance of eskape organisms, improving use of health-care resources.

TI  == population biology of gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == infections caused by multiresistant gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance  against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and s. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force  of genetic diversity in e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of s. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key  role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. in this  review, we discuss the population genetics of e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. aureus. knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.

TI  == tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. it is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). conjugative transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. the ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.

TI  == synthetic 3-arylideneflavanones as inhibitors of the initial stages of biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twenty two synthetic flavonoids is reported. among  them three 3-arylideneflavanones, 2b, 2c, and 2i, were shown to be highly active  against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis reference strains, with mic (minimal inhibitory concentration) values ranging from 4.68 microg/ml (14.3 microm) to 37.5 microg/ml (119.7 microm). the synergy of oxacillin and vancomycin with 2c, evaluated as fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) was shown (against planktonic culture of s. aureus a3  and e. faecium 138/09 clinical strains). the presence of 2c in the culture medium diminished the initial adhesion of bacteria to an abiotic surface. such an effect resulted in a decrease in biofilm formation during prolonged culture. unfortunately, 2e failed to eradicate the s. aureus mature biofilm which was already preformed, however, decreased the number of live biofilm cells. the biofilm of e. faecalis was more susceptible to the action of 3-arylideneflavanone 2c than the s. aureus biofilm. the finding that 3-arylideneflavanones are lipophilic, cause bacterial aggregation, and influence the integrity of membranes making them permeable to syto 9/propidium iodide dyes may implicate the cytoplasmic membrane as a target site for these compounds activity.

TI  == new noncovalent inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins from penicillin-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) are well known and validated targets for antibacterial therapy. the most important clinically used inhibitors  of pbps beta-lactams inhibit transpeptidase activity of pbps by forming a covalent penicilloyl-enzyme complex that blocks the normal transpeptidation reaction; this finally results in bacterial death. in some resistant bacteria the resistance is acquired by active-site distortion of pbps, which lowers their acylation efficiency for beta-lactams. to address this problem we focused our attention to discovery of novel noncovalent inhibitors of pbps. methodology/principal findings: our in-house bank of compounds was screened for inhibition of three pbps from resistant bacteria: pbp2a from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pbp2x from streptococcus pneumoniae strain 5204, and pbp5fm from enterococcus faecium strain d63r. initial hit inhibitor obtained by screening was then used as a starting point for computational similarity searching for structurally related compounds and several new noncovalent inhibitors were discovered. two compounds had promising inhibitory activities of both pbp2a and pbp2x 5204, and good in-vitro antibacterial activities against a panel of gram-positive bacterial strains. conclusions: we found new noncovalent inhibitors of pbps which represent important starting points for development of more potent inhibitors of pbps that  can target penicillin-resistant bacteria.

TI  == [trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in romania. experience of participation in earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system), 2002-2008].
AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
AB  == objective: to test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella spp., enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia  coli, enterobacter sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, chryseobacterium indologenes, proteus vulgaris and acinetobacter baumannii. method: in total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the us and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on mueller hinton agar (mha). results: the sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. for example, all acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at ph 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at ph 5.5. the silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of enterobacter and escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at ph 5.5. for enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at ph 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at ph 5.5. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. the average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at ph 7, compared with 8mm at ph 5.5. for mrsa and staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at ph 7. when the ph was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. conclusion: this study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of  burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the us. it also highlights the possible importance of ph and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. however, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this. conflict of interest: slp is employed by advanced medical solutions ltd.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant wound isolates.
AB  == wound dressings impregnated with silver have a role to play in aiding to reduce both the dressing and wound microbial bioburden. it is therefore imperative that  antimicrobial wound dressings have efficacy on a broad range of clinical significant microorganisms. accordingly, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against 115 wound isolates that had been isolated routinely from patients at west virginia university hospital. standardised corrected zones of inhibition (czois) were performed on all clinical isolates. it was found that the silver alginate dressing was able to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested. in particular, the silver alginate dressing inhibited the growth of candida albicans and yeasts with czoi of 3-11.5 mm. all meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains were  found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing with a czoi range calculated at 3-7.8 mm. sensitivity to the silver alginate dressing was also evident for s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. czois of 4.25 mm were calculated for enterococcus faecium and 9.8 mm for viridans streptococcus. the bacteria which demonstrated the highest tolerance to ionic silver included enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumannii. contrary to this the most responsive microorganisms to ionic silver included strains of staphylococci, viridans streptococcus and candida albicans. no antibiotic-resistant isolates, as identified by kirby bauer clinical laboratory standards institute classification  system, were found to be resistant to ionic silver. when a selected number of microorganisms were grown in the biofilm phenotypic state enhanced tolerance to silver was observed, compared to their non biofilm counterparts. overall, this study has demonstrated the broad antimicrobial activity of a silver alginate dressing on wound isolates grown in the non biofilm and biofilm state. this finding is clinically relevant as both the non biofilm and biofilm phenotypic states of microorganisms are evident in wounds and therefore significant to delayed healing. consequently, it is imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings demonstrate antimicrobial activity against microorganisms in both phenotypic states.

TI  == trafficking of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and co-colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == objectives: to determine the trafficking of methicillin-resistant staphylococci between the hospital and community as well as the occurrence of co-colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). subjects and methods: from november  2005 to april 2006, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (mrcons)-positive patients at the salmaniya medical complex, bahrain were assessed for vre co-colonization. characterization of vancomycin resistance genotype by pcr was carried out. close family contacts were screened for mrsa and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis of mrsa isolates from patient-family member pairs was conducted. results: one hundred and eighty-two patients (93 mrsa; 89 mrcons)  and 356 family members were enrolled. seven mrsa and 41 mrcons strains were isolated from the family members. pfge analysis revealed the presence of variants of a single mrsa clone among patients and their relatives. a total of 112 patients (62 mrsa; 50 mrcons) provided stool for vre screening. of these 13 stool specimens (11.6%) were vre-positive. all the vre isolates were from mrsa-positive patients, thus positivity rate among mrsa patients was 20.9% (n/n = 13/62). these were predominantly enterococcus gallinarum with vanc1 genotype and one strain was enterococcus faecium (vanb genotype). two e. gallinarum isolates harbored an additional vanb gene. the majority of vre isolates were from patients in medical  and surgical units (n/n = 10/13; 77%). male gender, prolonged hospitalization and presence of co-morbidities were significantly associated with mrsa/vre co-colonization (p < 0.05). conclusion: mrsa/vre co-colonization with mrsa trafficking between the hospital and community environment is a public health concern occurring in our setting.

TI  == linezolid, the first oxazolidinone antibacterial agent.
AB  == linezolid (zyvox) is the first member of an entirely new class of antibiotics to  reach the market in over 35 years; it was approved for use in 2000. a member of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics, linezolid is highly effective for the treatment of serious gram-positive infections and has activity that compares favorably with vancomycin for most clinically relevant pathogens. zyvox is approved for use against serious gram-positive infections, including those caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, and the very challenging methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium organisms. zyvox inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23s rrna in the catalytic site of the 50s ribosome. it can be administered both orally and intravenously and has good tissue distribution. recent results have demonstrated  that oxazolidinone analogs related to linezolid are effective in treating pulmonary tuberculosis caused by resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis in animal infection models and suggest additional new therapeutic applications for these antibiotics.

TI  == chemical characterization and biological properties of nvc-422, a novel, stable n-chlorotaurine analog.
AB  == during oxidative burst, neutrophils selectively generate hocl to destroy invading microbial pathogens. excess hocl reacts with taurine, a semi-essential amino acid, resulting in the formation of the longer-lived biogenerated broad-spectrum  antimicrobial agent, n-chlorotaurine (nct). in the presence of an excess of hocl  or under moderately acidic conditions, nct can be further chlorinated, or it can  disproportionate to produce n,n-dichlorotaurine (nndct). in the present study, 2,2-dimethyltaurine was used to prepare a more stable n-chlorotaurine, namely, n,n-dichloro-2,2-dimethyltaurine (nvc-422). in addition, we report on the chemical characterization, in vitro antimicrobial properties, and cytotoxicity of this compound. nvc-422 was shown effectively to kill all 17 microbial strains tested, including antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. the minimum bactericidal concentration of nvc-422 against gram-negative  and gram-positive bacteria ranged from 0.12 to 4 mug/ml. the minimum fungicidal concentrations against candida albicans and candida glabrata were 32 and 16 mug/ml, respectively. nvc-422 has an in vitro cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxicity = 1,440 mug/ml) similar to that of nndct. moreover, our data showed that this agent possesses rapid, ph-dependent antimicrobial activity. at ph 4, nvc-422 completely killed both escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 min at a concentration of 32  mug/ml. finally, the effect of nvc-422 in the treatment of an e. coli-infected granulating wound rat model was evaluated. treatment of the infected granulating  wound with nvc-422 resulted in significant reduction of the bacterial tissue burden and faster wound healing compared to a saline-treated control. these findings suggest that nvc-422 could have potential application as a topical antimicrobial.

TI  == clinical utility of daptomycin in infective endocarditis caused by gram-positive  cocci.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria account for >80% of all cases of endocarditis. currently,  staphylococci are the leading cause of endocarditis worldwide. daptomycin is the  drug of choice for empirical antibiotic therapy of staphylococcal endocarditis due to its optimal activity both against meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains. daptomycin has not been proven to be superior to vancomycin in the treatment of mrsa endocarditis. however, daptomycin should be considered the drug of choice for the treatment of  mrsa endocarditis caused by strains with a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 2mug/ml, for heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (hvisa) phenotypes and for glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa) strains. daptomycin is the drug of choice for rescue therapy in cases of mrsa endocarditis in which vancomycin has failed. the appropriate dose of daptomycin has not yet been established; however, for treatment of left-sided endocarditis the dose of daptomycin should be higher than the recommended dose of 6mg/kg/day.  combination antibiotic therapy with daptomycin (e.g. combined with fosfomycin) is a promising treatment for mrsa endocarditis and warrants further investigation. in vivo studies show that daptomycin is superior to vancomycin in the treatment of meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci experimental endocarditis, although clinical data are required. daptomycin could represent an  efficacious treatment for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium endocarditis. finally, the pharmacokinetic profile of daptomycin makes it an excellent drug for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  == bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. the characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. the  clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation  from january 1997 to march 2006 were reviewed. one hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (gpb), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (gnb). nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset gpb or gnb versus patients with late-onset gpb (66.7% versus 23.7%, p < 0.001) or gnb (70.6% versus 20.0%, p = 0.001). peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, p = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, p = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset gpb versus patients with late-onset gpb. likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset gnb than late-onset gnb (41.2% versus 6.7%, p = 0.007). staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset  gpb, whereas enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus species were most common in  patients with late-onset gpb. pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most  common pathogens in patients with early-onset gnb, whereas escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset gnb. in conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.

TI  == efficacy and safety of linezolid in liver transplant patients.
AB  == bacterial infections are the main cause of death within the first year after liver transplantation, and the increased incidence of multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens has created a major challenge in the treatment of these patients. linezolid, the first us food & drug administration-approved oxazolidinone, offers a valuable novel treatment option for serious gram-positive infections. linezolid is relatively non-toxic but prolonged treatment with linezolid was associated with thrombocytopenia. here we report on the experience  of linezolid treatment in adult liver transplant patients, who are at an increased risk for thrombocytopenia because of hypersplenism. from november 2003  until december 2009, we evaluated the clinical course of 46 liver transplant patients (27 male/19 female) in our surgical intensive care unit. for proven or probable gram-positive infection, all patients received linezolid 600 mg intravenously every 12 h. on clinical improvement, treatment was changed to oral  linezolid 600 mg twice daily. treatment duration was 11 +/- 7 days. treatment indications were pneumonia (n = 8), blood stream infection (n = 30), and surgical site/abdominal infection (n = 3). clinical cure was achieved in 43 out of 46 patients. during the course of treatment, no cases of severe thrombocytopenia occurred and a statistically significant platelet count increase was seen from day 1 (110 +/- 73/nl) to day 7 (165 +/- 116/nl) and day 14 (180 +/- 140/nl). we did not observe any further adverse events, especially no severe neurological complications (e.g., serotonin syndrome) or signs of lactate acidosis. two patients died from uncontrolled vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium sepsis  with septic shock and one due to uncontrolled methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. these deaths were considered to be unrelated to  linezolid treatment, and linezolid was regarded as the optimal treatment choice in these patients. a subgroup analysis of patients treated for >14 days revealed  no statistically significant differences when compared with patients on shorter treatment. in particular, no cases of thrombocytopenia occurred during longer treatment. in conclusion, linezolid is a safe and effective treatment for adult liver transplant patients with gram-positive infections.

TI  == [causative agents of intravenous catheter-related infections and their antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  == intravenous catheterization can lead to colonization as well as a broad spectrum  of infections ranging from catheter site infections to catheter-related blood stream infections (crbsis). the aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of causative agents and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in  crbsis and catheter site infections along with the colonization rates and colonizing microorganisms in zonguldak karaelmas university hospital, turkey. the results of cultures from catheter tips and/or intracatheter blood cultures and simultaneously taken peripheral blood cultures were sent to medical microbiology  laboratory and were retrospectively investigated for 201 patients hospitalized between september 2007 and september 2009. the catheter tips were cultured by semi-quantitative and quantitative culture methods. blood cultures from the catheters and peripheral veins were performed in bactec 9120 (becton dickinson, usa) blood culture systems. the antibiotic susceptibility tests were done by kirby-bauer disk diffusion method according to the guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). out of 201 patients included, 28 (13.9%) had crbsis and 13 (6.4%) had catheter site infections while colonization was defined for 55 (27.3%) patients. of 28 patients with crbsis, acinetobacter spp. were isolated from 11 including five carbapenem-resistant strains, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcns) from eight, methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (mscns) from two, klebsiella pneumoniae from two patients and one of each patient's cultures yielded methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), carbapenem-resistant  pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli and mrcns + enterococcus faecium. of 13 patients with catheter site infections, five mscns, two methicillin-susceptible s.aureus (mssa), two e.coli, and one of each k.pneumoniae, mrcns, enterococcus spp., k.pneumoniae + p.aeruginosa were isolated. no resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin were detected among the staphylococci isolated from crbsis and catheter site infections. the distribution of the 55 colonizing microorganisms were as follows; 18 mscns, 18 mrcns, four acinetobacter spp., five k.pneumoniae, three e.coli, two mssa, and one of each mrsa, p.mirabilis, p.aeruginosa, corynebacterium spp., candida albicans. in this  study, the predominant microorganism isolated from crbsis was acinetobacter spp., followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci. this unexpected distribution of the agents was related to the acinetobacter spp. that have gained endemic potential following an acinetobacter outbreak in our hospital in 2006. we emphasize that it is critical for any individual hospital to assess periodically the distribution and susceptibility profiles of isolates obtained from catheter-related infections to set out rational empirical treatment strategies.

TI  == multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae including metallo-beta-lactamase producers are predominant pathogens of healthcare-associated infections in an indian teaching hospital.
AB  == purpose: a study was carried out in an indian teaching hospital in 2009 to detect the rate of surgical site infections (ssi) and peripheral vascular access site infections. materials and methods: the study was a point-prevalence study involving over 300 patients. the presence of infection was determined according to the cdc criteria. swabs were taken from the infected sites and identification  and sensitivity were carried out using vitek(r) 2 automated system. characterisation of beta-lactamase was carried out at arrml, colindale, london. results: the rate of ssi was 15% for the clean and clean-contaminated categories  while that for the dirty contaminated category was 85% (nnis risk index 0). cultures yielded definite or probable pathogens from 64% (9/14) of the patients with ssi. in 1/3 rd of the cultures, staphylococcus aureus was grown and the rest had enterobacteriaceae, either extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  or amp-c hyperproducers and, alarmingly, three isolates were positive for newly recognised new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1). in medicine, 87% (n = 99)  of the patients had a peripheral iv access device, 55% developed associated phlebitis/infection and, in seven, probable pathogens were isolated (candida species and escherichia coli producing esbl and ndm-1, respectively, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium). all esbl and metallo-beta-lactamase producers were resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobials, the latter being sensitive only to colistin and tigecycline. the  study also found that all post-operative patients were on antibiotics, 92% on iv  [213 defined daily doses (ddd)/100 post-op patients] limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (26%) and aminoglycosides (24%) and imidazole derivatives (30%). in medicine, 83% (n = 82) were on iv antibiotics (123 ddd/100  bed-days), limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (74%). conclusion: indiscriminate use of antibiotics is a major problem predisposing patients to harm by multi-resistant pathogens. carbapenems were in little use in  this hospital, but the selection pressure exerted by cephalosporins and other unrelated classes was sufficient to select ndm-1-producing strains due to co-selection, suggesting a role of single plasmid carrying resistance genes to multiple classes.

AB  == the aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial  pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints. mics of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight french hospitals. disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm). the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by mic(50/90) (mics for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/l), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant cons, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; enterococcus faecalis,  0.25/1; enterococcus faecium, 64/128; enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. according to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for mics of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/l respectively. in conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many gram-positive bacteria, including mrsa but not e. faecium, whilst maintaining a gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == vancomycin-dependent enterococcus faecium vana: characterization of the first case isolated in a university hospital in brazil.
AB  == in this study, we report the characterization of a strain of enterococcus faecium vana, which grows only in the presence of vancomycin (vdefm-uel). the bacterium was isolated from the feces of a female patient who had undergone surgical treatment of reinke's edema and was receiving intravenous vancomycin therapy for  infection with methicillin/oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, a postoperative complication. antimicrobial dependence was further confirmed by the vancomycin e-test. vdefm-uel was also shown to be resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, levofloxacin, penicillin, rifampicin, and teicoplanin. the putative virulence genes efaa, gele and esp were detected by pcr. the ddl gene from vdefm-uel was cloned and sequenced. vancomycin dependence seems to be associated with the insertion of a nucleotide in that sequence, which results in a frame-shift mutation, introducing a premature stop codon. this is the first report of vancomycin-dependent e. faecium isolation in a university hospital in brazil.

TI  == vancomycin-resistance transferability from vana enterococci to staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == in last decade methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus with high level of vancomycin-resistance (vrsa) have been reported and generally the patients with vrsa infection were also infected with a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre). considering that the high level of vancomycin-resistance in vrsa isolates seems to involve the horizontal transfer of tn1546 transposon containing vana gene from coinfecting vre strains, the authors have studied the "in vitro" conjugative transfer of this resistance from vana enterococci to s. aureus. out of 25 matings performed combining five vancomycin-resistant enterococci as donors (three enterococcus faecalis and two enterococcus faecium), and five s. aureus as recipients, all clinical isolates, two have been successful using e. faecalis as  donor. the transfer of vancomycin-resistance was confirmed by vana gene amplification in both transconjugants and the resistance was expressed at lower levels (mic 32 mug/ml) in comparison with the respective vre donors (mic > 128 mug/ml). the vancomycin-resistance of trasconjugants was maintained even after subsequent overnight passages on msa plates containing subinhibitory levels of vancomycin. this study shows that the vana gene transfer can be achieved through  techniques "in vitro" without the use of laboratory animals employed, in the only similar experiment previously carried out by other authors, as substrate for the  trasconjugant growth. moreover, in that previous experiment, contrary to this study, the vancomycin resistant s. aureus trasconjugants were selected on erythromycin agar and not by direct vancomycin agar selection.

TI  == prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern nigeria.
AB  == enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. the aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in osogbo, nigeria. the study was conducted between january and june 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of enterococcus species at the  bacteriology laboratory of ladoke akintola university of technology, osogbo using standard microbiological methods. there were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (hai); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. two species of enterococcus were identified; enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection  (uti) and surgical site infection (ssi) of 6 (85.7%) patients and enterococcus faecium from uti in 1 (14.3%) patient. other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were klebsiella spp 31.0%, pseudomonas spp 20.7%, staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, escherichia coli 12.1%, staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and serratia spp 1.7%. all the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) with the vre strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. other gram-positive and gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except e. coli and pseudomonas spp which  were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. this limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci  infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. there is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and  rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.

TI  == telavancin activity against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  == telavancin is approved in the united states and canada for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) in adults caused by susceptible gram-positive organisms. the antimicrobial activity of telavancin and comparators was evaluated against 5,027 (2007-2008) gram-positive bacteria responsible for sssi in medical centers in asia-pacific, european, latin american, and north american regions. telavancin was active against staphylococcus aureus (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l). telavancin inhibited all enterococcus faecalis, including four strains displaying a vanb phenotype, at </= 1 mg/l (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.25/0.5 mg/l), except for two isolates with a vana phenotype (mic, >2 mg/l). vancomycin-susceptible and vanb vancomycin-resistant e. faecium were inhibited by telavancin at </= 0.25 mg/l, while this drug exhibited elevated mic values (>/= 0.5 mg/l) against e. faecium of vana phenotype (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 2/>2 mg/l). telavancin was potent  against beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 100.0%  susceptible) and viridans group streptococci (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible). these in vitro data document the activity of telavancin against contemporary gram-positive isolates and support its clinical use for the  treatment of csssi caused by the indicated pathogens.

TI  == treatment of meningitis caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium: high-dose and combination daptomycin therapy.
AB  == objective: to report 3 successful treatments of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium meningitis in adults using daptomycin and either linezolid or gentamicin. case summary: three case reports involving males (aged 58-78 years) are presented; in each case (trigeminal nerve microvascular decompression and subdural hygroma; paraspinal abscess; and hydrocephalus with subsequent craniotomy and ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement) csf examination revealed vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) susceptible to daptomycin, gentamicin, and/or linezolid. threeto four-week treatment regimens with daptomycin 6-12 mg/kg and either gentamicin or linezolid led to clinical resolution and microbiological clearance of infection. discussion: daptomycin has previously been shown to be successful in treating methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus-associated meningitis and other serious vre and enterococcal infections. higher than approved doses of daptomycin were used in 2 cases where in theory higher csf concentrations would thus be obtained. gentamicin and linezolid were added to daptomycin therapy based on in vitro data synergy results and because of documented successful treatment for vre meningitis, respectively. conclusions: the difficulty in treating vre csf infections involves both drug kinetics and microbial resistance factors, as well as external factors such as foreign bodies  like shunts. this report highlighted 3 cases where daptomycin use in concert with either gentamicin or linezolid was successful in treating this infection. additional controlled trials will be helpful in identifying the best strategies when using daptomycin to treat csf infections.

TI  == photodynamic inactivation of multi-resistant bacteria (pib) - a new approach to treat superficial infections in the 21st century.
AB  == the increasing resistance of bacteria against antibiotics is one of the most important clinical challenges of the 21(st) century. within the gram-positive bacteria the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium represent the major obstacle to successful therapy. apart from the development of new antibiotics it requires additional differently constituted approaches, like photodynamic inactivation in order to have further effective treatment options against bacteria available. certain dyes, termed photosensitizers, are able to store the absorbed energy in long-lived electronic states upon light activation with appropriate wavelengths and thus make these states available for chemical activation of the immediate surroundings. the interaction with molecular oxygen,  which leads to different, very reactive and thus cytotoxic oxygen species, is highlighted. in this review the application of the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria will be discussed regarding the possible indications in dermatology, like localized skin and wound infections or the reduction of nosocomial colonization with multi-resistant bacteria on the skin. the crucial advantage of  the local application of photosensitizers followed by irradiation of the area of  interest is the fact that independent of the resistance pattern of a bacterium a  direct inactivation takes place similarly as with an antiseptic. in this review the physical-chemical and biological basics of photo-dynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib) will be discussed as well as the possible dermatological indications.

TI  == characterization of lytic enzyme open reading frame 9 (orf9) derived from enterococcus faecalis bacteriophage phief24c.
AB  == in bacteriophage (phage) therapy against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis, members of a genus of spo1-like viruses are typically employed because of their extreme virulence and broad host spectrum. phage phief24c, which is a spo1-like virus infecting e. faecalis, has previously been characterized as a therapeutic phage candidate. in addition to the phage itself, phage endolysin is also recognized as an effective antimicrobial agent. in this study, a putative endolysin gene (orf9) of e. faecalis phage phief24c was analyzed in silico, and its activity was characterized using the recombinant form. first, bioinformatics analysis predicted that the open reading frame 9 (orf9) protein is n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase. second, bacteriolytic and bactericidal activities of orf9 against e. faecalis were confirmed by zymography, decrease of  peptidoglycan turbidity, decrease of the viable count, and morphological analysis of orf9-treated cells. third, orf9 did not appear to require zn(2+) ions for its  activity, contrary to the bioinformatics prediction of a zn(2+) ion requirement.  fourth, the lytic spectrum was from 97.1% (34 out of 35 strains, including vancomycin-resistant strains) of e. faecalis strains to 60% (6 out of 10 strains) of enterococcus faecium strains. fifth, n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase activity of orf9 was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and the subsequent maldi-postsource decay (psd) analyses. finally, functional analysis using n- or c-terminally deleted orf9 mutants suggested that a complete orf9 molecule is essential for its activity. these results suggested that orf9 is an endolysin of  phage phief24c and can be a therapeutic alternative to antibiotics.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of telavancin studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of telavancin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin against six  staphylococcus aureus strains (1 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa] strain, 4 methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] strains, and 1 vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus [visa] strain) and three enterococcus sp. strains (1 enterococcus faecalis strain, 1 enterococcus faecium strain, and 1 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium [vref] strain) were compared using an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection. analyzing the data from all five vancomycin-susceptible s. aureus (vssa) strains or all 4 mrsa strains showed that telavancin was superior in its antibacterial effect as measured by the area under the bacterial kill curve at 24 h (aubkc(24)) and 48 h (aubkc(48)) in comparison to vancomycin or teicoplanin (p  < 0.05). telavancin was also superior to vancomycin and teicoplanin in terms of its greater early killing effect (p < 0.05). against the three enterococcus spp.  tested, telavancin was superior to vancomycin in terms of its aubkc(24), aubkc(48), and greater early bactericidal effect (p < 0.05). dose-ranging studies were performed to provide free-drug area under the concentration-time curve over  24 h in the steady state divided by the mic (fauc/mic) exposures from 0 to 1,617  (7 to 14 exposures per strain) for 5 vssa, 4 visa, and the 3 enterococcus strains. the fauc/mic values for a 24-h bacteriostatic effect and a 1-log-unit drop in the viable count were 43.1 +/- 38.4 and 50.0 +/- 39.0 for vssa, 3.2 +/- 1.3 and 4.3 +/- 1.3 for visa, and 15.1 +/- 8.8 and 40.1 +/- 29.4 for the enterococcus spp., respectively. the reason for the paradoxically low fauc/mic values for visa strains is unknown. there was emergence of resistance to telavancin in the dose-ranging studies, as indicated by subpopulations able to grow on plates containing 2x mic telavancin concentrations compared to the preexposure population analysis profiles. changes in population analysis profiles were less likely with enterococci than with s. aureus, and the greatest risk of changed profiles occurred for both species at fauc/mic ratios of 1 to 10. maintaining a fauc/mic ratio of >50 reduced the risk of subpopulations able to grow on antibiotic-containing media emerging. these data help explain the clinical effectiveness of telavancin against mrsa and indicate that telavancin may have clinically useful activity against enterococcus spp., and perhaps also visa, at human doses of 10 mg/kg of body weight/day. in addition, they support a  clinical breakpoint of sensitive at </=1 mg/liter for both s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == antimicrobial characterisation of solithromycin (cem-101), a novel fluoroketolide: activity against staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  == solithromycin (cem-101) is a novel fluoroketolide with high potency against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. in this study, solithromycin and comparator antimicrobials were tested against a contemporary collection of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and other enterococcus spp. collected in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. solithromycin was active against s. aureus [minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms (mic(50))=0.12 mug/ml] and was two-fold more active than telithromycin (mic(50)=0.25 mug/ml). solithromycin was more potent against methicillin (oxacillin)-susceptible s. aureus [mic(50)=0.06 mug/ml and mic for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=0.12 mug/ml) compared with methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant s. aureus (mic(50)=0.12 mug/ml and mic(90)>16 mug/ml). solithromycin activity was reduced amongst heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate  s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (mic(50)>16 mug/ml). against strains with defined susceptibilities to erythromycin, clindamycin and telithromycin, solithromycin showed potent inhibition against all combinations (mic(50)=0.06 mug/ml) except those with non-susceptibility to telithromycin (>2 mug/ml) (mic(50)>16 mug/ml). the solithromycin mic(50) for e. faecium (1 mug/ml) was four-fold higher than the mic(50) for e. faecalis (0.25 mug/ml). in summary, solithromycin demonstrated high potency against many staphylococcus and enterococcus spp. isolated from contemporary infections worldwide.

AB  == liver transplantation (ltx) is a technically well established procedure in acute  and in end-stage liver diseases. however, opportunistic infections remain one of  the important complications in short and long-term outcome of ltx patients. bloodstream and pulmonary infections are the major cause of death in the first year following liver transplantation. due to extended use of chinolons and third  generation cephalosporines there is a shift towards multidrug-resistant bacteria  including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and extended b-lactamase-producing gram negative rods. fungal infections are mainly due to candida spp. viral infections, such as with cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, herpes simplex virus, and epstein-barr virus infections are another major cause of morbidity in patients receiving solid organ transplants, including liver transplant patients. studies of infection following ltx are necessary to improve management and to provide a better outcome after ltx. this review focuses on the most important bacterial, fungal and viral  infections in ltx patients.

TI  == progress and challenges in implementing the research on eskape pathogens.
AB  == the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance  to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. however, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. in addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. the difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research  in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to  identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.

TI  == medical-grade honey enriched with antimicrobial peptides has enhanced activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  == honey has potent activity against both antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria, and is an interesting agent for topical antimicrobial application to wounds. as honey is diluted by wound exudate, rapid bactericidal activity up to high dilution is a prerequisite for its successful application. we investigated the kinetics of the killing of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by rs honey, the source for the production of revamil(r) medical-grade honey, and we aimed to enhance the rapid bactericidal activity of rs honey by enrichment with its endogenous compounds or the addition of antimicrobial peptides (amps). rs honey killed antibiotic-resistant isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium, and burkholderia cepacia within 2 h, but lacked such rapid activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli. it was not feasible to enhance the rapid activity of rs honey by enrichment with endogenous  compounds, but rs honey enriched with 75 mum of the synthetic peptide bactericidal peptide 2 (bp2) showed rapid bactericidal activity against all species tested, including mrsa and esbl e. coli, at up to 10-20-fold dilution. rs honey enriched with bp2 rapidly killed all bacteria tested and had a broader spectrum of bactericidal activity than either bp2 or honey alone.

AB  == purpose: antimicrobial resistance monitoring could be a useful source of information for treating and controlling nosocomial infections. we analyzed antimicrobial resistance data generated by korean hospitals and by a commercial laboratory in 2005 and 2007. materials and methods: susceptibility data for 2005  and 2007 were collected from 37 and 41 hospitals, respectively, and from one commercial laboratory. intermediate susceptibility was not included in the calculation of resistance rates. results: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (64%), third-generation cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), fluoroquinolone-resistant escherichia coli (27%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (33%), and acinetobacter spp. (48%), and amikacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (19%) and acinetobacter spp. (37%) were prevalent in hospitals in 2007. a gradual increase of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. was observed. higher incidences of thirdgeneration cephalosporin-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae and imipenemresistant p. aeruginosa were found in the commercial laboratory than in the hospitals. conclusion: methicillin-resistant s. aureus, third-generation cephalosporin- resistant k. pneumoniae, and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. remain prevalent in korea, while the incidence  of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. has  increased gradually. the higher prevalences of third-generation cephalosporinresistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa in the commercial laboratory are a new concern.

AB  == grape skin extracts of riesling vitis vinifera l. grapes from conventionally or organically managed cultivars were compared on the basis of their phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, antimicrobial and antimutagenic properties and pesticide loads. promising results on their biological properties suggest that those extracts would be valuable as food preservatives. the antioxidant capacity  of conventional extracts was significantly higher, according to the higher content in catechin, epicatechin and procyanidin b. pesticide loads did not affect the antimutagenic or antimicrobial properties of the extracts. both extracts inhibited the growth of gram-positive foodborne pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium to similar  extents. possibly as a result of higher amounts of quercetin and its derivatives, higher antimicrobial effects against listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium were observed for the organic white grape skin extracts. conventional or organic extracts did not show remarkable antimutagenic effects when tested against the mutagen iq by means of the ames test. due to the presence of fungicides, the conidial germination of penicillium expansum, penicillium chrysogenum and aspergillus niger, were inhibited by 95% by conventional gse, while negligible effects were observed with organic grape extracts. the latter, however, showed inhibitory effects against trichoderma viridie and aspergillus versicolor.

TI  == evaluation of the diversilab system for detection of hospital outbreaks of infections by different bacterial species.
AB  == many bacterial typing methods are specific for one species only, time-consuming,  or poorly reproducible. diversilab (dl; biomerieux) potentially overcomes these limitations. in this study, we evaluated the dl system for the identification of  hospital outbreaks of a number bacterial species. appropriately typed clinical isolates were tested with dl. dl typing agreed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) for acinetobacter (n = 26) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 13) isolates. with two exceptions, dl typing of klebsiella isolates (n = 23) also correlated with pfge, and in addition, pfge-nontypeable (pfge-nt) isolates could be typed. enterobacter (n = 28) results also correlated  with pfge results; also, pfge-nt isolates could be clustered. in a larger study (n = 270), a cluster of 30 isolates was observed that could be subdivided by pfge. the results for escherichia coli (n = 38) correlated less well with an experimental multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (mlva) scheme. pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 52) showed only a limited number of amplification products for most isolates. when multiple pseudomonas isolates were assigned to a single type in dl, all except one showed multiple multilocus sequence types. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus generally also showed a limited number of amplification products. isolates that belonged to different outbreaks by other typing methods, including pfge, spa typing, and mlva, were grouped together in a number of cases. for enterococcus faecium, the limited variability  of the amplification products obtained made interpretation difficult and correlation with mlva and esp gene typing was poor. all of the results are reflected in simpson's index of diversity and adjusted rand's and wallace's coefficients. dl is a useful tool to help identify hospital outbreaks of acinetobacter spp., s. maltophilia, the enterobacter cloacae complex, klebsiella  spp., and, to a somewhat lesser extent, e. coli. in our study, dl was inadequate  for p. aeruginosa, e. faecium, and mrsa. however, it should be noted that for the identification of outbreaks, epidemiological data should be combined with typing  results.

AB  == objectives: the antimicrobial activity of telavancin against 2279 clinical gram-positive cocci obtained from patients with nosocomial pneumonia [np; including those with ventilator-acquired pneumonia (vap)] located in numerous medical centres worldwide was evaluated. methods: a contemporary collection of 2279 non-duplicate consecutive gram-positive clinical isolates were submitted from 87 hospitals located in north america (913 isolates), latin america (222 isolates), europe (690 isolates), and the asia-pacific region (454 isolates) as part of the international telavancin surveillance programme for 2007-08. isolates were tested for susceptibility by the reference broth microdilution method (with  2%-5% lysed horse blood added for testing of streptococci). interpretive criteria were those from clsi (m100-s20, 2010) except for telavancin, for which the susceptible breakpoints approved by the us fda were applied. results: telavancin  was highly active against staphylococcus aureus (mic(90), 0.25 mg/l; 100% susceptible), coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic(90), 0.25 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.03 mg/l), viridans group streptococci (mic(90), 0.06 mg/l; 100% susceptible), beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(90), 0.06 mg/l; 100% susceptible) and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (mic(90), 0.5 mg/l; 100% susceptible). telavancin inhibited all staphylococci at </= 0.5 mg/l.  among enterococci non-susceptible to vancomycin (all enterococcus faecium), telavancin was active against isolates exhibiting a vanb phenotype (mic, 0.06-0.12 mg/l), but less potent against vana strains (mic, >/= 2 mg/l). conclusions: telavancin demonstrated equal or greater potency than the comparators (vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin) against gram-positive pathogens implicated in np. telavancin showed elevated mic values only against enterococcus isolates showing  a vana phenotype. the continued appearance of multidrug-resistant pathogens among gram-positive isolates, mainly s. aureus, necessitates the introduction of new agents and longitudinal surveillance to monitor for the potential emergence of resistance.

TI  == superhydrophilicity and antibacterial property of a cu-dotted oxide coating surface.
AB  == background: aluminum-made settings are widely used in healthcare, schools, public facilities and transit systems. frequently-touched surfaces of those settings are likely to harbour bacteria and be a potential source of infection. one method to  utilize the effectiveness of copper (cu) in eliminating pathogens for these surfaces would be to coat the aluminum (al) items with a cu coating. however, such a combination of cu and al metals is susceptible to galvanic corrosion because of their different electrochemical potentials. methods: in this work, a new approach was proposed in which electrolytic plasma oxidation (epo) of al was  used to form an oxide surface layer followed by electroplating of cu metal on the top of the oxide layer. the oxide was designed to function as a corrosion protective and biocompatible layer, and the cu in the form of dots was utilized as an antibacterial material. the antibacterial property enhanced by superhydrophilicity of the cu-dotted oxide coating was evaluated. results: a superhydrophilic surface was successfully prepared using electrolytic plasma oxidation of aluminum (al) followed by electroplating of copper (cu) in a cu-dotted form. both cu plate and cu-dotted oxide surfaces had excellent antimicrobial activities against e. coli atcc 25922, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) atcc 43300 and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) atcc 51299. however, its cu-dotted surface morphology allowed the cu-dotted oxide surface to be more antibacterial than the smooth cu plate surface. the enhanced antibacterial property was attributed to the superhydrophilic behaviour of the cu-dotted oxide surface that allowed the bacteria to have a more effective killing contact with cu due to spreading of the bacterial suspension media. conclusion: the superhydrophilic cu-dotted oxide coating surface provided an effective method of controlling bacterial growth and  survival on contact surfaces and thus reduces the risk of infection and spread of bacteria-related diseases particularly in moist or wet environments.

TI  == bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  == non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. the purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. overall, gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than gram-positive bacteria. for the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cenocepacia and escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the sa  78 and atcc 6538 strains, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. a rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with p. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive staphylococcus aureus  strain sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. a 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. a 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated p. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. a statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated  animals after the third day of the course. wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.

TI  == synthesis and biological evaluation of muraymycin analogues active against anti-drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == muraymycin analogues with a lipophilic substituent were synthesized using an ugi  four-component assemblage. this approach provides ready access to a range of analogues simply by altering the aldehyde component. the impact of the lipophilic substituent on the antibacterial activity was very large, and analogues 7b-e and  8b-e exhibited good activity against a range of gram-positive bacterial pathogens including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. this study also showed that the accessory urea-dipeptide motif contributes to mray inhibitory and antibacterial activity. the knowledge obtained from our structure-activity relationship study of muraymycins provides further direction toward the design of potent mray inhibitors. this study has set the stage for the generation of novel antibacterial "lead" compounds based on muraymycins.

TI  == coagulase-negative staphylococcus and enterococcus as predominant pathogens in liver transplant recipients with gram-positive coccal bacteremia.
AB  == background: gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus have been a common cause of infection among liver transplant (lt) recipients in recent decades. the understanding of local epidemiology and its evolving trends with regard to pathogenic spectra and antibiotic susceptibility is beneficial to prophylactic and empiric treatment for lt recipients. this study aimed to investigate etiology, timing, antibiotic susceptibility and risk factors for multidrug resistant (mdr) gram-positive coccal bacteremia after lt. methods: a cohort analysis of prospectively recorded data was performed to investigate etiologies, timing, antibiotic susceptibility and risk factors for mdr gram-positive coccal bacteremia in 475 lt recipients. results: in 475 lt recipients in the first six months after lt, there were a total of 98 episodes of bacteremia caused by gram-positive cocci in 82 (17%) patients. seventy-five (77%) bacteremic episodes occurred in the first post-lt month. the most frequent gram-positive cocci were methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus  (cons, 46 isolates), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 13) and enterococcus (34, e. faecium 30, e. faecalis 4). in all gram-positive bacteremic  isolates, 59 of 98 (60%) were mdr. gram-positive coccal bacteremia and mdr gram-positive coccal bacteremia predominantly occurred in patients with acute severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis b and with fulminant/subfulminant hepatitis. four independent risk factors for development of bacteremia caused by  mdr gram-positive coccus were: lt candidates with encephalopathy grades ii - iv (p = 0.013, or: 16.253, 95%ci: 1.822 - 144.995), pre-lt use of empirical antibiotics (p = 0.018, or: 1.029, 95%ci: 1.002 - 1.057), post-lt urinary tract infections (p < 0.001, or: 20.340, 95%ci: 4.135 - 100.048) and abdominal infection (p = 0.004, or: 2.820, 95%ci: 1.122 - 10.114). the main infectious manifestations were coinfections due to gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. conclusions: methicillin-resistant cons and enterococci are predominant  pathogens among lt recipients with gram-positive coccal bacteremia. occurrences of gram-positive coccal bacteremia may be associated with the severity of illness in the perioperative stage.

TI  == microbiological findings of culture-positive preservation fluid in liver transplantation.
AB  == bacterial and fungal infections are the leading cause of mortality in liver transplant (lt) recipients. few studies have examined the incidence of culture-positive preservation fluid (pf) and the outcome of related recipients. the aim of this study was to determine the incidence and the microbiologic findings of pf positive cultures, and to evaluate the impact on morbidity and mortality of lt recipients. a retrospective analysis of pf cultures performed after 477 lts from cadaveric grafts between january 2001 and february 2008 was conducted. forty-five (9.5%) pfs were found to be positive with 1 or 2 pathogens. the demographic profiles of recipients of pf with positive or negative cultures were similar. enterobacteriaceae species were the most frequent organisms (n = 30), followed by staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), coagulase-negative staphylococci  (n = 5), enterococci (n = 4), and yeasts (n = 3). mortality rate at 1 month was not significantly different in recipients with positive or sterile pf cultures (88.1% vs. 87.7%, respectively). the rate of bacteremia among lt recipients with  positive or negative pf cultures was not statistically different. systemic infections caused by the pathogen cultured from the pf occurred in 8 (18%) of the 45 recipients, including bacteremia (4/8) or intra-abdominal sepsis (5/8). causative organisms were enterobacteriaceae species (n = 5), candida species (n = 2), and enterococcus faecium (n = 1). among the 8 patients who developed infection with the pf organism, 4 (50%) died in the intensive care unit (icu) vs. an icu mortality rate of 8% (3/37) in those who did not develop infection with the pf organism (p < 0.05). infection occurred less frequently in recipients who  received antimicrobial therapy with activity against the pf isolate than in those without appropriate treatment (41% vs. 3.8%, p < 0.005). those who develop infection with organisms recovered from pf cultures appear to have high early mortality rates; therefore, appropriate antimicrobial therapy against organisms cultured from pf should be given.

TI  == evaluation of pathogen detection from clinical samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction using a sepsis pathogen dna detection kit.
AB  == introduction: sepsis is a serious medical condition that requires rapidly administered, appropriate antibiotic treatment. conventional methods take three or more days for final pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. we organized a prospective observational multicenter study in three study sites to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and potential clinical utility of the septifast system, a multiplex pathogen detection system used in the clinical  setting to support early diagnosis of bloodstream infections. methods: a total of 212 patients, suspected of having systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs)  caused by bacterial or fungal infection, were enrolled in the study. from these patients, 407 blood samples were taken and blood culture analysis was performed to identify pathogens. whole blood was also collected for dna detection kit analysis immediately after its collection for blood culture. the results of the dna detection kit, blood culture and other culture tests were compared. the chosen antimicrobial treatment in patients whose samples tested positive in the dna detection kit and/or blood culture analysis was examined to evaluate the effect of concomitant antibiotic exposure on the results of these analyses. results: septifast analysis gave a positive result for 55 samples, while 43 samples were positive in blood culture analysis. the dna detection kit identified a pathogen in 11.3% (45/400) of the samples, compared to 8.0% (32/400) by blood culture analysis. twenty-three pathogens were detected by septifast only; conversely, this system missed five episodes of clinically significant bacteremia (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 2; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1; klebsiella spp, 1; enterococcus faecium, 1). the number of samples that tested positive was significantly increased by combining the result of the blood culture analysis with those of the dna detection kit analysis (p = 0.01). among antibiotic pre-treated patients (prevalence, 72%), septifast analysis detected more bacteria/fungi, and was less influenced by antibiotic exposure, compared with blood culture analysis (p = 0.02). conclusions: this rapid multiplex pathogen detection system complemented traditional culture-based methods and offered some added diagnostic value for the timely detection of causative pathogens, particularly in antibiotic pre-treated patients. adequately designed intervention studies are needed to prove its clinical effectiveness in improving  appropriate antibiotic selection and patient outcomes.

TI  == isolation and identification of enterococcus faecium from seafoods: antimicrobial resistance and production of bacteriocin-like substances.
AB  == a collection of isolates from uncooked seafoods (molluscs, fish, and fish fillets) were identified as enterococcus faecium species and studied in further detail. isolates were clustered in well-defined genomic groups according to food  origin after eric-pcr analysis. four isolates (fr 1-2, fb 1-3-b, fb 3-1, fta 1-2) decarboxylated lysine, ornithine, and tyrosine. isolate fr 1-2 also decarboxylated histidine. most isolates were sensitive to antibiotics of clinical use, but resistance was detected more frequently towards nitrofurantoin (50%), erythromycin (33.33%) or rifampicin (33.33%) to quinupristin/dalfopristin (12.5%). resistance to beta-lactams or vancomycin was not detected. the enterococcal antigen a was the presumed virulence trait detected most frequently. none of isolates carried haemolysin/cytolysin genes. twelve isolates produced anti-listerial activity. among them, seven isolates also produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances against other enterococci, and one isolate was also able to inhibit staphylococcus aureus. three isolates only were active against listeria monocytogenes, and two only were active against enterococci. one bacteriocinogenic isolate carried the enterocin a structural gene, but genes corresponding to other enterocins (entb, entp, entq, ent1071, entl50a/entl50b, and ent31) were not detected. bacteriocin-producing enterococci lacking undesirable traits (such as antibiotic resistance or biogenic amine production) or their produced bacteriocins could be potential candidates to aid in preservation of seafoods and other food products as well.

TI  == dissemination of an enterococcus inc18-like vana plasmid associated with vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == of the 9 vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa) cases reported to date in the literature, 7 occurred in michigan. in 5 of the 7 michigan vrsa cases, an  inc18-like vana plasmid was identified in the vrsa isolate and/or an associated vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolate from the same patient. this plasmid may play a critical role in the emergence of vrsa. we studied the geographical distribution of the plasmid by testing 1,641 vre isolates from three separate collections by pcr for plasmid-specific genes traa, repr, and vana. isolates from one collection (phase 2) were recovered from surveillance cultures  collected in 17 hospitals in 13 states. all vre isolates from 2 michigan institutions (n = 386) and between 60 and 70 vre isolates (n = 883) from the other hospitals were tested. fifteen vre isolates (3.9%) from michigan were positive for an inc18-like vana plasmid (9 e. faecalis [12.5%], 3 e. faecium [1.0%], 2 e. avium, and 1 e. raffinosus). six vre isolates (0.6%) from outside michigan were positive (3 e. faecalis [2.7%] and 3 e. faecium [0.4%]). of all e.  faecalis isolates tested, 6.0% were positive for the plasmid, compared to 0.6% for e. faecium and 3.0% for other spp. fourteen of the 15 plasmid-positive isolates from michigan had the same tn1546 insertion site location as the vrsa-associated inc18-like plasmid, whereas 5 of 6 plasmid-positive isolates from outside michigan differed in this characteristic. most plasmid-positive e. faecalis isolates demonstrated diverse patterns by pfge, with the exception of three pairs with indistinguishable patterns, suggesting that the plasmid is mobile in nature. although vre isolates with the vrsa-associated inc18-like vana  plasmid were more common in michigan, they remain rare. periodic surveillance of  vre isolates for the plasmid may be useful in predicting the occurrence of vrsa.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == inactivation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) on various environmental surfaces by mist application of a stabilized chlorine dioxide and quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectant.
AB  == contaminated environmental surfaces are important reservoirs in the transmission  of many human pathogens. although several options exist for disinfecting contaminated environmental surfaces, few are compatible with use on both hard smooth non-porous (hard) and soft porous surfaces (soft) while still offering significant disinfection of the contaminating organisms. this study evaluated the efficacy of mist application of a stabilized chlorine dioxide and quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectant (cryocide20) for inactivation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) on various environmental surfaces. mrsa and vre were applied to hard and soft surfaces (glass, steel, tile, carpet, and cotton fabric), allowed to dry, and exposed to a uniform mist application of the disinfectant solution. after 1 hr of contact time, the residual disinfectant was  neutralized, and the bacteria were recovered and enumerated on brain heart infusion (bhi) agar. reduction of both test bacteria was observed on most of the  hard and soft surfaces tested. log(10) reduction of the organisms tended to be higher on steel, tile, and carpet than glass or cotton. overall, these results suggest that mist application of cryocide20 disinfectant may be an effective option for reduction of low levels of infectious bacterial pathogens from contaminated environmental surfaces.

AB  == introduction: the objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units (icus). methods: the study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 german icus from 2001 through 2008. data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density (ad) expressed as daily defined doses (ddd) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days. results: total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 ddd/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). carbapenem use almost doubled to an ad of 151 in 2008. significant increases were also calculated for quinolone (ad of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use (ad of 117 in 2008). aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially (ad of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 26% and 20% (p = 0.006; trend  test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) faecium 2.3% and 8.2% (p = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3gc)-resistant escherichia. coli 1.2% and 19.7% (p < 0.001), 3gc-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8% and 25.5% (p < 0.001), imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 1.1% and 4.5% (p = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant k. pneumoniae 0.4% and 1.1%. the resistance densities did not change for mrsa but increased significantly for vre  faecium and 3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. in 2008, the resistance density for mrsa was 3.73, 0.48 for vre, 1.39 for 3gc-resistant e. coli and 0.82  for k. pneumoniae. conclusions: although total antibiotic use did not change over time in german icus, carbapenem use doubled. this is probably due to the rise in  3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant a. baumannii.

TI  == chrysophaentins a-h, antibacterial bisdiarylbutene macrocycles that inhibit the bacterial cell division protein ftsz.
AB  == eight new antimicrobial natural products named chrysophaentins a-h belonging to a new structural class have been isolated from the marine chrysophyte alga chrysophaeum taylori. their structures were determined by extensive 2d nmr and ms techniques and are characterized by the presence of two polyhalogenated, polyoxygenated omega,omega'-diarylbutene units connected by two ether bonds to form the suite of macrocyclic natural products. chrysophaentin a, the most potent of these antibiotics, inhibited the growth of clinically relevant gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic(50) 1.5 +/- 0.7 microg/ml), multidrug-resistant s. aureus (1.3 +/- 0.4 microg/ml), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (mic(50) 2.9 +/- 0.8 microg/ml). in vitro enzyme assays and transmission electron microscopy showed chrysophaentin a  to inhibit the gtpase activity of the bacterial cytoskeletal protein ftsz with an ic(50) value of 6.7 +/- 1.7 microg/ml, as well as gtp-induced formation of ftsz protofilaments. saturation transfer difference (std) nmr experiments further confirmed chrysophaentin a binds to ftsz, and nmr competition experiments with gtpgammas showed chrysophaentin a and gtp to bind competitively to ftsz. last, molecular docking simulations provided a low energy model in which chrysophaentin a binds in and occludes a large portion of the gtp binding site of ftsz in a manner that is consistent with the binding epitope determined by std nmr.

TI  == rapid analysis of gram-positive bacteria in water via membrane filtration coupled with nanoprobe-based maldi-ms.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) mass spectrometry (ms) is challenging when it is directly applied to identify bacteria in water. this study demonstrates a rapid, sensitive, and selective technique for detection of gram-positive bacteria in water. it involves a combination of membrane filtration (mf) and vancomycin-conjugated magnetite nanoparticles (vnps) to selectively separate and concentrate gram-positive bacteria in tap water and reservoir water, followed by rapid analysis of the isolates using whole-cell maldi-ms. vnps specifically recognize cells of gram-positive bacteria, which serves as a basis for affinity capture of target gram-positive bacteria. a two-step procedure of surface modification of bare magnetite nanoparticles was applied to synthesize vnps. mf prior to vnp-based magnetic separation can effectively increase the enrichment factor and detection sensitivity and reduce time-consuming culture steps and the matrix effect for analysis of bacteria in maldi-ms. the enrichment  factor for the mf-vnp technique is about 6 x 10(4). a variety of bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecium, were successfully analyzed from aqueous solutions and their mixtures with gram-negative bacteria. the optimal conditions of the vnp/maldi-ms  technique, including selection of the maldi matrix, the choice of cell-washing solution, and the vnp concentration, were also investigated. the capture efficiencies of gram-positive bacteria with vnps were 26.7-33.3%. the mass variations of characteristic peaks of the captured bacteria were within +/-5 da,  which indicated good reproducibility of the proposed technique. the technique was applied to detect gram-positive bacteria in tap water and reservoir water with an analysis time of around 2 h. the detection limit for bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus was 5 x 10(2) cfu/ml for 2.0-l water samples.

TI  == clinical and microbiological spectrum of necrotizing fasciitis in surgical patients at a philippine university medical centre.
AB  == objective: the study describes the clinical characteristics, bacteriology and risk factors for mortality of patients with necrotizing fasciitis (nf), seen in a university medical centre. methods: the medical charts of nf patients admitted to the institution from january 2004 to july 2007 were retrieved and reviewed retrospectively. results: the majority of the 67 patients included in the study presented with localized nonspecific inflammatory manifestations: tenderness (94%), warmth (86%), oedema (76%), skin necrosis (75%), and ulceration (68%). diabetes mellitus (22%) was the most common predisposing medical condition. the most frequent isolates were escherichia coli (44%), acinetobacter baumannii (19%), staphylococcus aureus (15%) and enterococcus faecium (15%). overall mortality rate was 36%. risk factors significantly associated with mortality were truncal involvement (p = 0.034), leukocytosis (p = 0.038), acidosis (p = 0.001),  hypoalbuminaemia (p = 0.004), hypocalcaemia (p = 0.000) and hyponatraemia (p = 0.023). logistic regression analysis revealed acidosis [p < 0.05, odds ratio (or) = 9] and hypoalbuminaemia (p < 0.05, or = 14) as significant independent risk factors for mortality. conclusion: the identified risk factors can inform clinicians of increased mortality risks for certain patients with nf. they should serve as a trigger for more aggressive surgical and critical care, and antimicrobial therapy for these patients.

TI  == exposure-response analysis of tigecycline in pharmacodynamic simulations using different size inocula of target bacteria.
AB  == this study explored tigecycline exposure-bacterial responses in pharmacodynamic simulations (in vitro kinetic model) using different inocula. one meticillin-resistant vancomycin-heteroresistant staphylococcus aureus, one enterococcus faecium and one extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli with equal tigecycline minimum inhibitory concentrations/minimum bactericidal concentrations (mics/mbcs) (0.12/0.25 microg/ml) were used. a computerised pharmacodynamic bicompartmental model simulated three tigecycline twice-daily dosing regimens over 48h: 50mg (100mg loading dose); 100mg; and 150 mg. areas under bacterial growth curves were calculated, and differences between  the growth curve used as control and the killing curve of bacteria exposed to tigecycline (abbc) were determined. with standard inocula [ca. 1 x 10(6)colony-forming units (cfu)/ml], linear increases in area under the concentration-time curve (auc)/mic (25.6 for 50mg, 53.76 for 100mg and 79.52 for  150 mg) produced linear increases in activity against gram-positive organisms (mean abbcs of 120.60, 143.20 and 195.80 log cfu x h/ml for s. aureus and of 95.75, 172.55 and 216.90 log cfuxh/ml for e. faecium, respectively), with the activity of the 150 mg regimen being significantly higher (p<0.01) than that of the other two regimens. abbcs obtained with the 100mg regimen using standard inocula were similar to those obtained with the 150 mg regimen when using high inocula (ca. 1 x 10(7)cfu/ml). against e. coli, the highest dosing regimen was required to obtain significant antibacterial activity compared with control (mean abbcs of 145.75 log cfu x h/ml with standard inocula and 63.33 log cfu x h/ml with high inocula). an increase in tigecycline dosing appears to be an interesting therapeutic option to maximise antibacterial activity owing to its linear pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, especially when severe infections with high bacterial load are suspected.

TI  == effect of overnight storage of blood culture bottles on bacterial detection time  in the bactec 9240 blood culture system.
AB  == background/purpose: identifying the pathogens present in blood stream infections  is crucial to initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy and avoid morbidity and  mortality. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of overnight storage  of aerobic and anaerobic bactec 9240 blood culture bottles on the detection time  for common pathogens. methods: from november 2007 to july 2008, a total of 2,105  isolates were positively detected using the bactec 9240 system. the time to positive detection (ttd) was calculated by subtracting the time of receipt in the laboratory from the time required to detect a positive culture. the mean ttd values were calculated using the ttd value of the first positive culture bottle only. overnight delay at the national cheng kung university hospital, taiwan was  15 hours (from 5 pm to 8 am). results: of the 2,105 total isolates, 972 (46.1%) were gram-positive bacteria, 1,024 (48.6%) were gram-negative bacteria and 109 (5.1%) were fungi. among the top 10 pathogens, 24.7% grew only in the aerobic bottle and 15.1% in the anaerobic bottle, including staphylococcus spp., enterococcus faecium, enterobacteriaceae, and gram-positive bacilli. due to the overnight delay in loading a blood culture bottle into the instrument, for most of the pathogens (including staphylococcus spp. and enterobacteriaceae), a decrease in ttd by <or= 4.4 hours was observed. an increase in ttd by 20.8 hours  was observed for gram-positive bacilli. we also found that the difference between ttd in aerobic versus anaerobic bottles during the day was higher in coagulase-negative staphylococcus (12 hours) and lower in escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus (< 2 hours). ttd was longer than 72 hours in 20.5% of gram-positive bacilli and 7.3% of candida albicans. conclusion: no difference in  the ttd of major pathogens was observed in bottles processed during the day and after overnight delay, suggesting that the delayed entry of the blood culture bottle into the instrument may affect the detection time. since high numbers of facultative anaerobes were detected in anaerobic bottles only, use of a single aerobic bottle might have a detrimental effect on the clinical therapy outcome.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from skin and skin-structure infections in european medical centres.
AB  == skin and skin-structure infections (sssis) usually involve gram-positive organisms. prompt initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment is essential  for achieving a favourable outcome in severe cases. empirical antibacterial therapy should be based on several considerations, including patient risk factors, expected pathogens and local/regional susceptibility profiles, among others. in the present study, we evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with sssis hospitalised in european medical centres. a total of 3573 bacterial isolates were collected from 33 medical centres located in 13 european countries as well as israel over a 6-year period (2003-2008) and were tested for susceptibility to daptomycin and other comparator agents by reference broth microdilution methods in a central laboratory. the most frequently isolated organisms were staphylococcus aureus (71.1%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (10.5%) and enterococci (9.3%). overall, rates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) were 22.5% and 5.1%, respectively, but with great intercountry  variation. the overall mrsa rate varied slightly during the study period, but with no overall tendency toward increase or decrease, whilst the overall vre rate consistently increased from 1.5% in 2003 to 11.0% in 2008. daptomycin and linezolid were the most active agents tested overall. all isolates monitored were considered susceptible to daptomycin, and only one isolate (enterococcus faecium) was categorised as non-susceptible to linezolid. in conclusion, the results of this contemporary surveillance study indicate that daptomycin and linezolid retain sustained in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci isolated from patients hospitalised with sssi in numerous european medical centres.

TI  == evaluation of efflux activity of bacteria by a semi-automated fluorometric system.
AB  == a semi-automated method that uses the common efflux pump (ep) substrate ethidium  bromide (eb) is described for the assessment of ep systems of bacteria. the method employs the rotor-gene(tm) 3000 thermocycler (corbett research) for the real-time assessment of accumulation and efflux of eb in phosphate-buffered solution (pbs) under varying physiological conditions, such as temperature, ph, presence and absence of the energy source, and presence of efflux pumps inhibitors (epis). the method is sufficiently sensitive to characterize intrinsic ep systems of reference strains, a prime necessity if there is a need for assessment of ep-mediated multi-drug resistance (mdr). the method has been successfully applied by us to characterize intrinsic and over-expressed ep systems of escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and mycobacterium smegmatis and mycobacterium avium, suggesting that if the organism  can be maintained in pbs, the system described may suffice for the evaluation and assessment of its ep system.

TI  == [interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to the expression of the meca gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. for macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins b, (mls(b)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vana isolates). in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to mls(b) in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parc/pare (low level) and in gyra. it is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic  low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vana enterococci and case reports due to vanb2 enterococci have been recently reported.

TI  == expression of beta-defensin-3 in lungs of immunocompetent rats with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == background: despite the rising incidence and high rate of treatment failure of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), to date there has been no rat model specifically designed for antimicrobial evaluation. beta-defensin-3 acronym for beta-defensin-3 is correct  as (bd-3) is an antimicrobial peptide and mainly expresses in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract. it demonstrates a broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity against many potentially pathogenic microbes, including multi-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. therefore, the authors hypothesized that the expression of  bd-3 might change in lungs of rats with mrsa vap, and this change might play an important role in the pathogenesis of vap. materials and methods: eighty specific pathogen-free male sprague-dawley rats were randomly assigned to the following experimental groups: (1) n (nonventilated pneumonia) group (n=34): rats were infected intrabronchially with 0.2 ml of 10(10) cfu/ml mrsa inoculum; (2)v (ventilator-associated pneumonia) group (n=34): rats were ventilated for 4 h using the protective ventilation settings: 6 ml/kg tidal volume, 5 cm h(2)o of positive end-expiratory pressure (peep), 88 breaths/min, and f(i)o(2)=0.21. after ventilation, rats were inoculated intrabronchially with the same amount of mrsa as in n group; (3) p (protective mechanical ventilation) group (n=6): 0.2 ml of normal saline was instilled into lungs of rats after 4 h of ventilation as in v group; (4) c (control) group (n=6): only 0.2 ml of normal saline were instilled into lungs of rats. rats from both p and c groups were killed 48 h after instillation of normal saline. rats from other two groups were killed 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 h after inoculation. pneumonia evaluation was performed by macroscopic, histopathologic, and microbiologic criteria. the expression of bd-3 in lungs was  determined by immunohistochemistry staining and western blot analysis. results: rats inoculated after 4 h of protective mechanical ventilation rapidly developed  progressive pneumonia with heterogeneous distribution of lesions and different degrees of histologic evolution predominating in lower lobes. lung bacterial concentrations in v group at each time point were significantly higher than those of n group. it was 12.2+/-0.9log(10) cfu/g of tissue at h 48 in v group, and 8.7+/-0.4 in n group. bacteremia occurred in nine of 10 rats at h 48 in v group,  while two of 10 rats in n group. both c and p groups showed a very low level of bd-3. compared with c group, the expression of bd-3 at h 48 in both n and v groups significantly increased. however, the latter was significantly lower than  the former. conclusions: rat model of mrsa vap was obtained by intrabronchially inoculating rats with 2x10(9) cfu mrsa after 4h of protective mechanical ventilation. vap was more severe than nonventilated pneumonia in terms of histopathologic and microbiologic criteria, especially systemic spread. this may  be associated with the inhibited up-regulation of bd-3 expression by mechanical ventilation.

TI  == how honey kills bacteria.
AB  == with the rise in prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, honey is increasingly valued for its antibacterial activity. to characterize all bactericidal factors in a medical-grade honey, we used a novel approach of successive neutralization of individual honey bactericidal factors. all bacteria  tested, including bacillus subtilis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli, ciprofloxacin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, were killed by 10-20% (v/v) honey, whereas > or = 40% (v/v) of a honey-equivalent sugar solution was required for similar activity. honey accumulated up to 5.62 +/- 0.54 mm h(2)o(2) and contained 0.25 +/- 0.01 mm methylglyoxal (mgo). after enzymatic neutralization of these two compounds, honey retained substantial activity. using b. subtilis for activity-guided isolation of the additional antimicrobial factors, we discovered bee defensin-1 in honey. after combined neutralization of h(2)o(2), mgo, and bee defensin-1, 20% honey had only minimal activity left, and subsequent adjustment of the ph of this honey from 3.3 to 7.0 reduced the activity to that of sugar alone. activity against all other bacteria tested depended on sugar, h(2)o(2), mgo, and bee defensin-1. thus, we fully characterized the antibacterial activity of medical-grade honey.

TI  == in vitro prevention of the emergence of daptomycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus and enterococci following combination with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or  ampicillin.
AB  == daptomycin is bactericidal against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate-resistant s. aureus (gisa) and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. however, selection for daptomycin-resistant derivatives has occasionally been reported during therapy in humans. here we evaluate whether selection for daptomycin-resistant s. aureus or  enterococci could be prevented in vitro by combining daptomycin with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, gentamicin or rifampicin. six strains of s. aureus (four mrsa and two gisa) and four strains of enterococci (two enterococcus faecalis and two enterococcus faecium) were serially exposed in broth to two-fold stepwise increasing concentrations of daptomycin alone or in combination with a fixed concentration [0.25x minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)] of either of the second agents. the daptomycin mic was examined after each cycle. exposure to daptomycin alone gradually selected for s. aureus and enterococci with an increased mic. gentamicin did not prevent the emergence of daptomycin-resistant bacteria. rifampicin was also unable to prevent daptomycin resistance, although resistance was slightly delayed. in contrast, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin prevented or greatly delayed the selection of daptomycin-resistant mutants in s. aureus and enterococci, respectively. addition of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin to daptomycin prevents, or greatly delays, daptomycin resistance in vitro. future studies in animal models are needed to predict the utility of these combinations in humans.

AB  == over the last decade the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been a growing problem, especially in some geographic areas, making useless most of the classical antibiotic therapies. the rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is  the result of different factors as the intrinsic microbial complexity, the growing attitude to travel of humans, animals and goods, the use of antibiotics outside hospitals, and the lack of precise therapeutic chooses for high risk group of patients. the antibiotic-resistance becomes certainly a serious problem  when a resistant pathogen, and often multi-resistant today, is present in an infective site. in fact in a recent estimate of the centre for disease control and prevention (cdc) about 90.000 deaths per year in the usa are attributable to  bacterial infections and in particular to resistant pathogens. it appears clear that the clinic relevance of this problem is the decimation of the sensible germs of the normal flora that leads to the upper hand of the only resistant bacteria.  the antibiotic therapy, in fact, select the resistance and each bacteria has developed a particular strategy to survive: mutations of the genetic content or acquisition of resistance genes from the external. among the gram positive bacteria, besides methicillin resistant staphyloccocus aureus, there are other pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, some species of streptococci and multiresistant corynebacterium. the cons, eg. s. epidermidis, s. hominis and s. haemolyticus, are recognized as new important nosocomial pathogens and are not only responsible of invasive infections but have become in few years resistant to oxacillin (more  than 60%) and multiresistant. the unsuspected fragility of glycopeptides, which for 40 years have been the most important treatment against infections due to gram-positive bacteria, has posed the need for new antimicrobial molecules. among the therapeutic possible options there are linezolid, tygecyline and daptomycin,  but new other molecules are appearing in the clinical use like ceftobiprole and dalbavancin.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibility to linezolid in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus strains].
AB  == there has been a dramatic increase in the number of infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) worldwide. linezolid which is one of the first oxazolidinones in clinical use, has bacteriostatic activity on gram-positive bacteria including  mrsa and vre. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro susceptibilities of mrsa and vre clinical isolates to linezolid. a total of 100 mrsa strains isolated from clinical specimens as infectious agents (96 blood, 2 pleural fluid, 1 peritoneal fluid, 1 joint fluid isolates), and 101 vre (enterococcus faecium) strains isolated from clinical specimens as colonizing or  infectious agents (79 rectal swabs, 11 blood, 3 catheter, 3 peritoneal fluid, 3 urine, 2 wound isolates) in microbiology laboratory of uludag university medical  faculty hospital, turkey, were included to the study. in vitro linezolid activity has been searched by e-test method and all of the isolates were found susceptible to linezolid. linezolid minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ranged for mrsa and vre between 0.25-3 microg/ml and 0.25-2 microg/ml, respectively. linezolid mic50 and mic90 values for mrsa were 1.5 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml, respectively, while for vre these values were 0.75 microg/ml and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively. our results were in parallel with the data of other national and international studies, emphasizing that linezolid is a new and effective choice in treatment of infections caused by resistant gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == [recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  == the discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. these discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. however, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. in this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.

TI  == challenges in anti-infective development in the era of bad bugs, no drugs: a regulatory perspective using the example of bloodstream infection as an indication.
AB  == bloodstream infections present many challenges to clinicians. the number of hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection continues to increase, and the number of newly available antimicrobial agents to treat these particularly lethal infections and many other serious infections continues to decrease. drug-development programs for bloodstream infection that have adhered to existing regulatory guidelines have not been significantly successful. this article examines the regulatory history of the bloodstream infection indication as an example of the challenges faced by individuals and sponsors developing drugs for  treatment of the current spectrum of antimicrobial-resistant infections, with the goal of providing insight into development pathways for agents targeting drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. disease-specific and pathogen-specific indications are discussed, and recent regulatory approvals for bloodstream infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus are reviewed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of enterococcus faecium fair-e 198 against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of enterococcus faecium fair-e 198 against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. using the critical-dilution method, the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium fair-e 198 inhibited all l. monocytogenes strains evaluated (1,600 to 19,200 au ml(-1)). however, none of the b. cereus and s. aureus strains investigated were inhibited. the maximum activity of this bacteriocin (800 au ml(-1)) was observed in mrs broth, while the activity in milk was 100 au ml(-1). in the co-cultivation test in milk, b. cereus k1-b041 was reduced to below the detection limit (1.00 log cfu ml(-1)) after 48 h. e. faecium reduced the initial l. monocytogenes scott a population by 1 log cfu ml(-1) after 3 h at 35 degrees c, however, the pathogen regained growth, reaching 3.68 log cfu ml(-1) after 48 h. e. faecium did not influence the growth of s. aureus atcc 27154 during the 48 h of co-cultivation, therefore, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity of e. faecium fair-e 198 is strictly related to the species and strain of the target microorganism and to the culture medium.

TI  == new antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  == the optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. we herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections. the newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae infections. tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections  caused by enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), or multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.

TI  == early appropriate therapy of gram-positive bloodstream infections: the conservative use of new drugs.
AB  == among the gram-positive organisms, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecium represent the biggest therapeutic hurdles. the evolution of mrsa exemplifies the genetic adaptation of an organism into a first-class multidrug-resistant pathogen. glycopeptides such as vancomycin have been the treatment of choice for mrsa, but poor outcomes have frequently been reported, particularly among isolates with higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) within the susceptible range (< or =2 mg/l). further more,  vancomycin's limitations as an antibacterial agent include slow bactericidal activity and relatively poor tissue penetration. inadequate dosing may, however,  contribute to vancomycin's poor performance; the standard recommendation for trough concentrations of 5-10 mg/l is inadequate for serious infections such as bacteraemia and endocarditis. trough levels of 15-20 mg/l are probably necessary; however they are often associated with increased nephrotoxicity. despite the recent dramatic reduction in antibiotic research by pharmaceutical companies, a few compounds have been developed to treat gram-positive infections. quinupristin-dalfopristin, although shown to have in vitro activity against mrsa, is not approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of mrsa, and cannot be recommended for the treatment of s. aureus bacteraemia, except under exceptional circumstances. although linezolid and tigecycline may be useful in specific situations, they cannot be routinely recommended for the treatment of mrsa bacteraemia because of safety concerns and very limited available clinical data. daptomycin has recently been proven to be effective and well tolerated for  meticillin-sensitive s. aureus and mrsa bacteraemia, including right-sided endocarditis.

TI  == risk factors and management of gram-positive bacteraemia.
AB  == the incidence of gram-positive bloodstream infections has been increasing steadily. the virulence of coagulase-negative staphylococci is based mainly on their ability to produce biofilms, and thus cause infections of intravascular devices and foreign bodies, which must be removed to resolve the infection. staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of endocarditis, and it is important to recognize patients at risk of the complications of s. aureus bloodstream infections. the rate of meticillin resistance is higher in healthcare-related infections, although clones of community-acquired meticillin-resistant s. aureus  carrying the panton-valentine leukocidin have recently emerged. vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) creep gives cause for concern, and mics >1 microg/ml are associated with higher failure rates and mortality in patients with s. aureus bacteraemia treated with vancomycin. daptomycin should be considered the optimal empirical treatment for s. aureus bloodstream infections in settings  with medium to high prevalence of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections. enterococci are the third leading cause of gram-positive bacteraemia  in our institution. management of this disease is difficult because of its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, mainly in enterococcus faecium infections. the recently described synergism of ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is a good therapeutic option for enterococcus faecalis bacteraemia and endocarditis caused  by high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains.

TI  == significance of infection markers and microbiological findings during tissue processing of cryopreserved arterial homografts for the early postoperative course.
AB  == background: to evaluate homograft implantation for the urgent treatment of vascular infections on the basis of the course of infection using microbiological findings in perioperatively obtained specimens and during homograft processing. patients and methods: 85 patients were treated with cryopreserved homografts from 2004-2007. the microbiological findings of the decontamination process of homografts in the tissue bank were evaluated. the perioperative infection profile (microorganisms, crp, leukocytes, body temperature) of the patients was analysed. results: complete microbiological and clinical follow-up for the postoperative course was available for 35 patients, who were treated with homografts from the same tissue bank and finally included into this study. 55 cryopreserved homografts were implanted. 35/55 (64%) homografts were positive for microorganisms before decontamination. 3/35 (9%) homografts remained positive after the decontamination. 33 patients were operated for prosthetic graft infection and 2 for an infiltration of a large vessel from neighbouring malignant disease. the most common infection agent was staphylococcus aureus. thirty-day mortality was 20% (7/35). only in 4/35 (11%) patients were the microorganisms of  the intraoperative swabs also detected during the postoperative course. the microorganisms were orsa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and burkholderia cepacia. the patient with orsa infection died on pod 11 from multiple organ failure and all other patients recovered. none of the postoperative swabs showed the homograft predecontamination microorganisms. interestingly, a significant association (p = 0.003) between c-reactive protein increase two weeks after surgery and donor-recipient abo mismatch was found. conclusions: the implantation of homografts following the established decontamination is an alternative urgent therapeutic option in vascular infections with encouraging outcomes. the absence of the predecontamination focus in the postoperative specimens of patients, suggests that the postoperative course and outcomes show no strong relation to potential homograft contamination  prior to the decontamination process.

TI  == presence of pathogens and indicator microbes at a non-point source subtropical recreational marine beach.
AB  == swimming in ocean water, including ocean water at beaches not impacted by known point sources of pollution, is an increasing health concern. this study was an initial evaluation of the presence of indicator microbes and pathogens and the association among the indicator microbes, pathogens, and environmental conditions at a subtropical, recreational marine beach in south florida impacted by non-point sources of pollution. twelve water and eight sand samples were collected during four sampling events at high or low tide under elevated or reduced solar insolation conditions. the analyses performed included analyses of  fecal indicator bacteria (fib) (fecal coliforms, escherichia coli, enterococci, and clostridium perfringens), human-associated microbial source tracking (mst) markers (human polyomaviruses [hpyvs] and enterococcus faecium esp gene), and pathogens (vibrio vulnificus, staphylococcus aureus, enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis a virus, cryptosporidium spp., and giardia spp.). the enterococcus concentrations in water and sand determined by quantitative pcr were greater than the concentrations determined by membrane filtration measurement. the fib concentrations in water were below the recreational water quality standards for three of the four sampling events, when pathogens and mst markers were also generally undetectable. the fib levels exceeded regulatory guidelines during one  event, and this was accompanied by detection of hpyvs and pathogens, including detection of the autochthonous bacterium v. vulnificus in sand and water, detection of the allochthonous protozoans giardia spp. in water, and detection of cryptosporidium spp. in sand samples. the elevated microbial levels were detected at high tide and under low-solar-insolation conditions. additional sampling should be conducted to further explore the relationships between tidal and solar  insolation conditions and between indicator microbes and pathogens in subtropical recreational marine waters impacted by non-point source pollution.

TI  == [update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  == there is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics  in clinical practice. as observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. for instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. in fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium). therefore, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for gram-positive infections. this review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in france (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).

AB  == the seventh year of the zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against gram-positive pathogens in latin america, europe, canada, and the asia-pacific region. linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the united kingdom, japan, and china where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: s. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (748), enterococci (864), streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). eight linezolid-resistant (lzd-r) isolates were detected in 7 countries (italy [2], france, china, brazil, sweden, germany, and united kingdom) among the enterococci (enterococcus faecalis [3] and e. faecium [2]) and cons (3  staphylococcus epidermidis). five lzd-r isolates contained 23s rrna mutations (g2576t or g2447t), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. one cons (italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in taiwan. all streptococci  were linezolid susceptible (mic(90), 1 microg/ml). in conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. documented lzd-r remains rare  (only 0.13% overall but highest for cons [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of mrsa varied by geographic region and  between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.

TI  == linezolid surveillance program results for 2008 (leader program for 2008).
AB  == the leader program was initiated in 2004 and monitors emerging linezolid resistance in sampled us medical centers. this report summarizes the data obtained in 2008, the 5th consecutive year. a total of 57 institutions participated in 2008 representing all 9 us census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6113 isolates, 101.9% compliance to protocol design). the organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were staphylococcus aureus (3156), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 856), enterococci (901), streptococcus pneumoniae (619), and viridans group (223) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (358); also, d-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus. linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with mic(90) results ranging from 1 microg/ml (streptococci and cons) to 2 microg/ml (staphylococcus aureus and enterococci). only 0.36% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, a slight decrease from 0.45% and 0.44% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. the nonsusceptible strains (22) were staphylococcus aureus (3), cons (14), and enterococcus faecium (5) each with defined target mutations (g2576t in 19 strains; t2504a in 1 strain), mobile cfr element (1 strain staphylococcus epidermidis with an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern to a cfr-positive staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the same center in leader 2007), or an unknown (1 strain) mechanism. the mobile cfr resistance found in a staphylococcus aureus strain in 2007 was not observed in 2008. in conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 5th year of this leader program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.64% susceptibility  levels). the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable and the plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism that emerged in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains in 2007 showed no evidence of dissemination or increased prevalence. however, there was evidence of cfr persistence with the s. epidermidis strain. the leader program continues to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect and monitor novel oxazolidinone resistance phenotypes and genotypes.

AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. methods: in january 2004, the use of antibiotic  prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (icu). prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (csf) drainage. the effect on the antibiotic use density (ad: ddd [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (january 2002-december 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(january 2004-december 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. resistance proportions(rp) and resistance densities (rd), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis or e. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3gc) escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. results: total antibiotic  use by 147 ddd/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 ddd/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887ddd/1,000 pd post-intervention.  this decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. the reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. the rr  and rd of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli increased after january 2004, whereas the percentage of mrsa significantly decreased. conclusion: change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. it would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical icus may be very worthwhile.

TI  == in vitro effect of physiological concentrations of human albumin on the antibacterial activity of tigecycline.
AB  == objectives: to determine c(max) tigecycline activity in the presence/absence of physiological concentrations of human albumin with free fraction concentrations as controls. methods: killing curves (final inoculum: 1.0-5.0 x 10(7) cfu/ml) were performed with 0.88 mg/l final concentrations (serum c(max) after a 100 mg 1 h infusion) in mueller-hinton broth supplemented with ca(2+) and mg(2+) (mh) and  in mh with 4 g/dl human albumin. controls were curves in mh with concentrations similar to the free fraction (fc(max) = 0.17 mg/l) calculated using protein binding. activity was measured as log(10) initial inoculum reduction (log(10) initial inoculum-log(10) at 12 h/24 h). target strains (tigecycline mic/mbc; mg/l) were: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus heteroresistant to vancomycin (0.12/0.25); enterococcus faecium (0.12/0.25); escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (0.12/0.25); and acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/1). results: at 24 h the fc(max) produced mean decreases of < or  =0.1 cfu/ml for all strains, in contrast to the bactericidal activity (mean >3 log(10) reduction) provided by c(max) concentrations in the presence or absence of albumin for e. coli and e. faecium, and an activity nearly bactericidal for s. aureus (mean approximately 2.8 log(10) reduction). in the case of the a. baumannii isolate the c(max) in the presence or absence of albumin produced a mean reduction of 2.56 log(10) cfu/ml at 12 h (time of one dosing interval), with a bacteriostatic profile when considering 24 h colony counts (similar counts at 0 and 24 h). conclusions: correcting the total concentration for the reported literature binding values is unreliable since tigecycline antibacterial activity  was greater than that suggested by the free fraction of the drug.

TI  == in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (tg-873870), a novel non-fluorinated quinolone,  against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and streptococcus pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes in taiwan.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activities of nemonoxacin against gram-positive cocci with various resistance phenotypes. methods: mics of nemonoxacin were determined for 798 recently collected (2005-07) and non-duplicate isolates of gram-positive cocci by the agar dilution method. these isolates included: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 100); methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), including ciprofloxacin-susceptible (n = 50), ciprofloxacin-resistant (n = 100), vancomycin-intermediate (n = 50) and daptomycin-non-susceptible (dns-mrsa; n = 5) isolates, and community-acquired mrsa (ca-mrsa; n = 101); invasive streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 150); levofloxacin-non-susceptible (mics of 4-64 mg/l) s. pneumoniae isolates (n = 30); and enterococci (n = 212), including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre; n = 112). results: nemonoxacin had potent activity against mssa (mic(90) of < or =0.03 mg/l), ciprofloxacin-susceptible mrsa (mic(90) of < or =0.03 mg/l) and ca-mrsa (mic(90) of 0.06 mg/l). for all invasive s. pneumoniae isolates, the activity of nemonoxacin (mic(90) of 0.06 mg/l) was similar to that of gemifloxacin and much better than that of levofloxacin (mic(90) of 2 mg/l) and moxifloxacin (mic(90) of 0.25 mg/l). nemonoxacin had a 32- to 64-fold higher activity than levofloxacin against levofloxacin-non-susceptible isolates. nemonoxacin exerted limited activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant mrsa (mic(90) of 1 mg/l), vancomycin-intermediate mrsa (mic(90) of 2 mg/l), dns-mrsa (mic(90) of 1 mg/l), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (mic(90) of 2 mg/l for enterococcus faecalis and 4 mg/l for enterococcus faecium) and vre (mic(90) of 4  mg/l for e. faecalis and 16 mg/l for e. faecium). conclusions: our findings point to a potentially useful role for nemonoxacin in the treatment of infections caused by mssa, ciprofloxacin-susceptible mrsa and s. pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes.

TI  == total syntheses of (+/-)-platencin and (-)-platencin.
AB  == the secondary metabolites platensimycin and platencin, isolated from the bacterial strain streptomyces platensis, represent a novel class of natural products exhibiting unique and potent antibacterial activity. platencin, though structurally similar to platensimycin, has been found to operate through a slightly different mechanism of action involving the dual inhibition of lipid elongation enzymes fabf and fabh. both natural products exhibit strong, broad-spectrum, gram-positive antibacterial activity to key antibiotic resistant  strains, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. described herein are our synthetic efforts toward platencin, culminating in both  racemic and asymmetric preparation of the natural product. the syntheses demonstrate the power of the cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric diels-alder reaction and the one-pot reductive rearrangement of [3.2.1] bicyclic ketones to [2.2.2] bicyclic olefins.

TI  == is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  == objective: surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. these exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. the association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. design: prospective cohort study during 24 months. setting: eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. patients: all inpatients. interventions: none. measurements and main results: primary isolates  of six indicator organisms (acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant s. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. surveillance of nosocomial  infection rates was performed according to the german nosocomial infection surveillance system, krankenhaus infektions surveillance system. transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate spearman's rank-correlation test. during 100,781 patient days, 100,829  microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6  transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration  of hospitalization, or device use. conclusions: differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.

TI  == microbiology of drugs for treating multiply drug-resistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == several new antimicrobials demonstrate in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), and other gram-positive bacteria. data from large surveys indicate that linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline are almost universally active against mrsa. linezolid and tigecycline inhibit both enterococcus faecium  and enterococcus faecalis at low concentrations; daptomycin is somewhat more potent against the latter. the investigational agents dalbavancin and telavancin  are more potent than vancomycin against vancomycin-susceptible organisms. dalbavancin inhibits vanb type vre at low concentrations, but is not active against vana type vre. telavancin is less active against vre than against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, but minimum inhibitory concentrations are lower than those of vancomycin against vre. with continued careful use of available antimicrobials, the vast majority of these organisms should remain susceptible to 1 or more of the agents discussed for the foreseeable future.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria isolated from us medical centers: results of the daptomycin surveillance program (2007-2008).
AB  == gram-positive bacterial strains (12 443) consecutively collected during 2007 to 2008 in hospitals located in the united states were tested by reference broth microdilution methods against daptomycin and comparison agents. methicillin (oxacillin) resistance rates were 55.9% and 74.0% for staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively, and the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 5.4% and 75.4%, respectively. daptomycin was very active against all gram-positive species with mic(90) values of 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, and 2 microg/ml for staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci, respectively. overall, 99.9% of s. aureus, 100.0% of e. faecalis, and 99.5% of e. faecium were susceptible to daptomycin. in addition, daptomycin mic distributions for s. aureus and enterococci from 2007 to 2008 were very similar to those from 2002 to 2003. in summary, high rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were observed in us hospitals, but daptomycin remains active against these clinically important gram-positive organisms with no evidence of potency loss since its approval for clinical use in late 2003.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664),  enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), enterococcus faecium (n = 819), streptococcus  pyogenes (n = 959), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group c, g, and f streptococci (n = 84), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among s. pneumoniae isolates. among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. the maximum oritavancin mic against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the mic(90) against s. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. against e. faecalis and e. faecium, oritavancin mic(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including vana strains (n = 486), with mic(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against vana e. faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); mic(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. these data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. the data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.

TI  == lost in translation: differences in antimicrobial indication approval policies between the united states and europe.
AB  == objective: antimicrobials, like all drug products, are approved in the united states through the food and drug administration (fda) and in the european union partly through the european medicines agency (emea). this article investigates the differences in approved indications between these 2 bodies for a series of antimicrobial agents approved during the past decade. methods: the antimicrobial  compounds most recently approved for specific indications by both the fda and emea were included in the study. indications were recorded from the respective web sites and compared. differences in approved indications were considered major if one regulatory body approved an agent for treatment of a specific condition while the other did not, or if one regulatory body approved an agent only for prophylaxis while the other approved it also for treatment. differences were considered minor when the 2 bodies approved an antimicrobial for the same condition or pathogen but with different details regarding specific clinical situations. results: thirteen antimicrobial compounds approved by both the fda and emea were included in the study, namely anidulafungin, caspofungin, dapto-mycin, doripenem, ertapenem, linezolid, micafungin, posaconazole, quinupristin/dalfopristin, retapamulin, telithromycin, tigecycline, and voriconazole. among these 13 agents, differences in approved indications between  the united states and europe were found to be major for 6 and minor for 6. approved indications were the same for only 1 agent. major differences were noted for doripenem, linezolid, micafungin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, posaconazole, and telithro-mycin. examples of major differences include the following: linezolid has a us indication for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections, but no similar indication in europe; micafungin is indicated for pediatric use in europe but not in the united states; and use of posaconazole is  primarily therapeutic in europe but preventive in the united states. minor differences were noted for anidulafungin, caspofungin, daptomycin, ertapenem, retapamulin, and voriconazole. as an example of a minor difference, daptomycin has different indications for staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. tigecycline was the only agent for which the fda and emea had approved identical indications. conclusions: differences in the indications for most antimicrobial agents were found between the united states and europe. because any approved indication can be viewed as scientific evidence, these differences may raise legal issues regarding the treatment of specific entities. to minimize these differences, coordination is needed between the fda and emea regarding the procedures for approving indications.

TI  == investigation of the prevalence of patients co-colonized or infected with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci  in china: a hospital-based study.
AB  == background: nosocomial infection caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) could lead to increased  morbidity and mortality. in 2006, vre nosocomial spread became a reality in our hospital since the first vre nosocomial infection in 2003. little is known about  the prevalence of coexistence with vre and mrsa in the patients. the primary objective of the study was to identify the molecular characteristics of epidemic  mrsa clones in our hospital and the prevalence of the coexistence with mrsa and vre in same patients during the 2-year period, 2006 - 2007. methods: the clinical features, laboratory test results, and therapeutic outcomes of 129 cases who isolated mrsa collected from january 2006 to december 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to determine meca-femb type and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) type. all the participants were screened for clinical and microbiological data to identify the coexistence of vre strains with mrsa. results: one hundred and twenty-nine mrsa isolates were included in the study: 71 (55%) from the intensive care unit, 35 (27.2%) from the surgical wards and 23 (17.8%) from the medical wards. the most frequent source of isolation of mrsa was sputum (76.7%). from seven patients we isolated mrsa and vre (e. faecium) simultaneously during their inpatient stay. one hundred and twenty-seven (127/129, 98.4%) mrsa isolates harboured sccmec type iii, only 2 mrsa strains contained sccmec type ii. all of the 129 mrsa isolates remained sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. higher sensitivity rates were noted for chloramphenicol 99.2% (128/129). only 20.2% (26/129) of the mrsa isolates were sensitive to rifampin. all isolates presented resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents with high minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), including: beta-lactams (penicillin, oxacillin, cefoxitin, and cefazolin), tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, and quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin). conclusions: the predominant mrsa clone at beijing chaoyang hospital from 2006 to 2007 had the type iii sccmec element. all  of the mrsa isolates were multiresistant to antimicrobial agents. emergence of coexistence of mrsa and vre in the same patient was not rare. physicians should pay more attention to infections resulting from mrsa and vre. aggressive infection control measures should be taken to prevent the transmission of the multidrug resistance organism.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo properties of dihydrophthalazine antifolates, a novel family of antibacterial drugs.
AB  == racemic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine dihydrophthalazine derivatives bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 exhibited low in vitro mics toward small, selected panels of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae,  moraxella catarrhalis, and mycobacterium avium, though the compounds were less active against haemophilus influenzae. the constellation of dihydrofolate reductases (dhfrs) present in 20 enterococci and 40 staphylococci was analyzed and correlated with the antibacterial activities of the dihydrophthalazines and trimethoprim. dhfrs encoded by dfrb, dfra (s1 isozyme), dfre, and fola were susceptible to the dihydrophthalazines, whereas dhfrs encoded by dfrg (s3 isozyme) and dfrf were not. studies with the separated enantiomers of bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 revealed preferential inhibition of susceptible dhfrs  by the (r)-enantiomers. bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 were well tolerated by mice during 5- and 10-day oral toxicity studies at doses of up to 400 mg/kg of body weight. using a nonoptimized formulation, the dihydrophthalazines displayed acceptable oral bioavailabilities in mice, and efficacy studies with a septicemia model of mice infected with trimethoprim-resistant, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus gave 50% effective dose values in the range of 1.6 to 6.25 mg/kg.

TI  == inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western nigeria.
AB  == a total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from african indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by staphylococcus spp. (20%). the gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the staphylococcus spp.  showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. twenty-four lab isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. lab strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller  groups through amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). representative strains were identified as weissella spp., enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16s rdna. the weissella spp. and l. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity  against seven strains of gram negative uropathogens. two strains of l. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against lactobacillus sakei. in this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west nigeria was discovered.  based on their sensitivity to weissella spp., there is a potential for using these lab as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.

TI  == high hydrostatic pressure for disinfection of bone grafts and biomaterials: an experimental study.
AB  == background: autoclaving, heat, irradiation or chemical detergents are used to disinfect autografts, allografts and biomaterials for tissue reconstruction. these methods are often associated with deterioration of mechanical, physical, and biological properties of the bone grafts and synthetic implants. high hydrostatic pressure has been proposed as a novel method preserving biomechanical and biological properties of bone, tendon and cartilage. this is the first study  to assess the inactivation of clinically relevant bacteria on biomaterials and human bone by high hydrostatic pressure. methods: bacterial suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium, implants  covered with infected blood, human bone infected in vitro, and biopsies of patients with chronic osteomyelitis were subjected to different protocols of high hydrostatic pressure up to 600 mpa. bacterial survival after high hydrostatic pressure treatment was determined and compared with bacterial growth in untreated controls. results: s. aureus and p. aeruginosa in suspension were completely inactivated by high hydrostatic pressure (> 5log levels), whereas e. faecium showed barotolerance up to 600 mpa. blood and adherence to metal implants did not significantly alter inactivation of bacteria, and complete disinfection was achieved with barotolerant bacteria (s. aureus and p. aeruginosa). however, osteoarthritic bone demonstrated a non-homogeneous baroprotective effect, with single bone samples resistant to treatment resulting in unaltered bacterial growth, and complete disinfection of artificially infected bone specimens was achieved in 66% for s. aureus, 60% for p. aeruginosa and 0% for e. faecium. human bone samples of patients with chronic osteomyelitis could be completely disinfected in 2 of 37 cases. conclusion: high hydrostatic pressure offers new perspectives for disinfection of sensitive biomaterials and bone grafts, and contamination by blood did not significantly affect bacterial inactivation rates. however, a significant baroprotective effect was demonstrated in bone. effectiveness is currently limited to colonization and / or infection with barosensitive micro-organisms.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide cect7121 against human gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  == background: resistant gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. this work investigated the efficacy of ap-cect7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of enterococcus faecalis cect7121) against various pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. methods: strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard  antibiotic treatments. inhibitory activity of ap-cect7121 was assessed using the  agar-well diffusion method. the most resistant isolates from each species screened (enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. results: these bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant s. aureus and c. perfringens: viable counts for c. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. conclusions: ap-cect7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of smp-601 (ptz601) against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in neutropenic murine thigh infection models.
AB  == smp-601 (also known as ptz601, pz-601, or sm-216601) is a novel parenteral carbapenem with potent activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the pharmacodynamics of smp-601 against vref and mrsa were investigated in neutropenic murine thigh infection models. the percentage of the dosing interval that the unbound smp-601  concentration exceeded the mic (f%t>mic) was the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic  parameter that correlated most closely with efficacy with r(2) values of 0.81 to  0.84 for two strains of vref and 0.92 to 0.93 for two strains of mrsa, whereas the r(2) values for the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h divided by the mic were 0.12 to 0.89, and the r(2) values for the peak level divided by the mic were 0 to 0.22. the f%t>mic levels required for static or killing efficacy against two strains of vref (9 to 19%) apparently were lower than those against two strains of mrsa (23 to 37%). these results suggested that  smp-601 showed time-dependent in vivo efficacy against vref and mrsa, and smp-601 had a sufficient therapeutic effect against vref infections at lower exposure conditions compared to those for with mrsa infections.

TI  == [glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecium in a hospital in northern spain. molecular characterization and clinical epidemiology].
AB  == introduction: glycopeptide resistance in enterococcus spp. is a clinical problem  because of the rapid dissemination of these microorganisms, possible transfer of  vancomycin resistance to more virulent pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus,  and the limited therapeutic possibilities for the infections they cause. in this  study, 10 strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium isolated from 10 different patients in our hospital during 2004 to 2005 were characterized. methods: pcr was used to analyze the gene implicated in glycopeptide resistance.  molecular analysis of clinical isolates was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). the presence of genes previously associated with epidemicity/virulence (esp, hyl, asa1, gel, cyl) was also studied. risk factors were determined in a case-control study. results: the most commonly detected gene was vana. pfge analysis revealed 5 different genotypes (a-e), with a predominance of genotype a (n=3) and b (n=3). the esp (surface protein) and hyl (hyaluronidase) genes were detected in all strains, with the exception of genotypes b and d. the purk1 allele, associated with clonal complex 17 was demonstrated in all strains. conclusion: prior administration of cephalosporins,  aminoglycosides and vancomycin alone or in combination was significantly associated with colonization/infection by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium.

TI  == murf inhibitors with antibacterial activity: effect on muropeptide levels.
AB  == murf catalyzes the last cytoplasmic step of bacterial cell wall synthesis and is  essential for bacterial survival. our previous studies used a pharmacophore model of a murf inhibitor to identify additional inhibitors with improved properties. we now present the characterization of two such inhibitors, the diarylquinolines  dq1 and dq2. dq1 inhibited escherichia coli murf (50% inhibitory concentration, 24 microm) and had modest activity (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml) against lipopolysaccharide (lps)-defective e. coli and wild-type e. coli rendered permeable with polymyxin b nonapeptide. dq2 additionally displayed activity against gram-positive bacteria (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml), including methicillin (meticillin)-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates. treatment of lps-defective e. coli cells with >or=2x mic of dq1 resulted in a 75-fold-greater accumulation of the murf substrate compared to the  control, a 70% decline in the amount of the murf product, and eventual cell lysis, consistent with the inhibition of murf within bacteria. dq2 treatment of s. aureus resulted in similar effects on the murf substrate and product quantities. at lower levels of dq1 (<or=1x mic), the level of accumulation of the substrate was less pronounced (15-fold greater compared to the amount for the control). however, a 50% increase in the amount of the murf product compared to the control was reproducibly observed, consistent with the possible upregulation  of muropeptide biosynthesis upon partial inhibition of this pathway. the overexpression of cloned murf appeared to partly alleviate the dq1-mediated inhibition of muropeptide synthesis. the identification of murf inhibitors such as dq1 and dq2 that disrupt cell wall biosynthesis suggests that murf remains a viable target for an antibacterial agent.

TI  == a longitudinal analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility in clinical institutions  in germany as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (2004-2007).
AB  == background: the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) global surveillance program has been designed to assess the in vitro activity of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent tigecycline plus several comparative agents. methods: in vitro activities of bacterial isolates obtained from 13 centers in germany between 2004 and 2007 were evaluated longitudinally and pooled, using the interpretive criteria of the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast). results: tigecycline demonstrated good activity against both gram-positive and -negative pathogens monitored in this study [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (mic(90))  0.06-2 microg/ml] with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had elevated mics for most antimicrobial agents. imipenem and meropenem also showed good activity (mic(90) <or=0.06-4 microg/ml) against most gram-negative pathogens but were less active against gram-positive organisms (mic(90) <or=0.12 to >or=32  microg/ml). conclusions: tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens monitored in the t.e.s.t. study. a low tigecycline mic(90) was reported against acinetobacter baumannii and drug-resistant enterococcus faecium,staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the carbapenems showed the lowest mic(90) values against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive e. coli. e. coli susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents decreased over the course of this study.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == ceftobiprole: first cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftobiprole medocaril is the first member of a new series of advanced cephalosporins with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa). the drug received an approvable letter from the united states food and drug administration (fda) in march 2008 and from health canada in june 2008 for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections including diabetic foot infections. ceftobiprole exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) involved in cell wall synthesis. it has an established stability against hydrolysis by many gram-positive beta-lactamases and a higher affinity for various pbps (such as pbp2a of mrsa or pbp2x of streptococcus pneumoniae), which leads to a wider spectrum of activity compared with older beta-lactams. ceftobiprole activity does not cover extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae and some  other pathogens, including enterococcus faecium or acinetobacter baumanii. generally well tolerated, with nausea and taste disturbance being the most common adverse events, ceftobiprole appeared noninferior to empiric therapy in several clinical trials. ceftobiprole is available only for intravenous administration; recommended dosage regimens have not been approved by the fda as of this writing. however, based on the canadian package insert, expected dosage recommendations are 500 mg as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 12 hours for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by certain gram-positive pathogens, and 500 mg as a 2-hour infusion every 8 hours when susceptible gram-negative or both gram-positive and susceptible gram-negative pathogens are involved. dosage adjustments are indicated for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, and dosage recommendations are expected to be 500 or 250 mg, respectively, as a 2-hour infusion every 12 hours. several precautions regarding  hypersensitivity and drug incompatibility are reported. ceftobiprole represents a promising option for the treatment of mono- and polymicrobial infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive and susceptible gram-negative pathogens, but further toxicity and safety studies are warranted.

TI  == time-kill kinetics of oritavancin and comparator agents against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == objectives: oritavancin, a lipoglycopeptide, possesses bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. to understand the time dependence of oritavancin activity, we have undertaken time-kill experiments against isolates of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, including recent antibiotic-resistant strains. methods: six strains of s. aureus [methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), vancomycin-resistant s. aureus  (vrsa)] and five strains of enterococci [vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre; both vana and vanb)] were tested in time-kill assays; oritavancin assays included 0.002% polysorbate-80 to ensure quantitative drug recovery. oritavancin and comparators vancomycin, teicoplanin,  linezolid and daptomycin were tested at static concentrations approximating their free peak (fc(max)) and free trough (fc(min)) in plasma when administered at standard doses for complicated skin and skin structure infections. results: oritavancin showed concentration-dependent killing of all strains tested: at its  fc(max) predicted from a 200 mg dose in humans, oritavancin exerted bactericidal  activity (> or =3 log kill relative to starting inoculum) against mssa, mrsa and  vrsa within 1 h and against vse between 11 and 24 h. at predicted fc(max) from an 800 mg dose, oritavancin was bactericidal against visa strains at 24 h and against vre at 10 h. conclusions: oritavancin displayed concentration-dependent killing of mssa, mrsa, vrsa, visa, vse and vre. oritavancin was more rapidly bactericidal against all strains tested than were vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid or daptomycin at physiologically relevant concentrations. these data support the conclusion that oritavancin exerts concentration-dependent bactericidal activity on recent, drug-resistant isolates of s. aureus and enterococci.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem tested against prevalent gram-positive pathogens: results from a global surveillance study (2003-2007).
AB  == doripenem is a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem recently approved in the united states for treatment of complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various  gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading gram-positive species. we evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (north america, 43.0%; latin america, 11.7%; europe, 31.3%; and asia-pacific, 14.0%) doripenem surveillance program for the years 2003 to 2007. doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; mic(90) values, <or=0.06 microg/ml), with no differences noted between geographic regions. against enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (mic(50), 4 microg/ml) but was largely inactive against enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the united states, doripenem was highly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; mic(90), <or=0.06 microg/ml, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; mic(90), 0.25 microg/ml). doripenem appears broadly  active in vitro against gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and  non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1  mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode  of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.

TI  == bacterial diversity from benthic mats of antarctic lakes as a source of new bioactive metabolites.
AB  == during the micromat project, the bacterial diversity of microbial mats growing in the benthic environment of antarctic lakes was accessed for the discovery of novel antibiotics. in all, 723 antarctic heterotrophic bacteria belonging to novel and/or endemic taxa in the alpha-, beta- and gamma-subclasses of the proteobacteria, the bacteroidetes branch, and of the high and low percentage g+c  gram-positives, were isolated, cultivated in different media and at different temperatures, and then screened for the production of antimicrobial activities. a total of 6348 extracts were prepared by solid phase extraction of the culture broths or by biomass solvent extraction. 122 bacteria showed antibacterial activity against the gram-positives staphylococcus aureus and to a lower extent enterococcus faecium, and versus the gram-negative escherichia coli. few of these strains showed also some antifungal activity against cryptococcus neoformans, aspergillus fumigatus and to a lower extent candida albicans. lc-ms fractionation of extracts from a subset of strains (hits) that exhibited relatively potent antibacterial activities evidenced a chemical novelty that was further investigated. two strains of arthrobacter agilis produced potent antibacterial compounds with activity against gram-positives and possibly related to novel cyclic thiazolyl peptides. to our knowledge, this is the first report of new antibiotics produced by bacteria from benthic microbial mats from antarctic lakes. with no doubts these microbial assemblages represent an extremely rich source for the isolation of new strains producing novel bioactive metabolites with the potential to be developed as antibiotic compounds.

TI  == synthesis, characterization and biological activities of mixed ligand zr(iv) complexes.
AB  == mixed ligand ternary zr(iv) complexes of type [m(q)2lno3xh2o] have been synthesized using 8-hydroxyquinoline (hq) as a primary ligand and n- and/o-donor  amino acids (hl) such as l-serine, l-alanine and glycine as secondary ligands. these complexes were characterized on the basis of elemental analysis, conductance measurement, spectral and thermal studies. the molar conductance study of the complexes in dmf solvent signifies their non-electrolytic nature whereas the thermal analyses specify presence of a coordinated water molecule. the complexes were tested for antifungal and antibacterial activity by using agar well diffusion bioassay. the antibacterial activity was tested against the pathogenic bacteria staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. the results obtained were evaluated with antibacterial standard vancomycin. the antifungal activity was tested against candida albicans, candida krusei, aspergillus fumigatus and the results obtained were compared with antifungal standard amphotericin b. the complexes were also screened for cytotoxicity studies against ehrlich ascites cells and daltons lymphoma ascites cells and show very low cytotoxicity.

TI  == tr-700 in vitro activity against and resistance mutation frequencies among gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == background: tr-700, the active component of the oxazolidinone prodrug tr-701, has demonstrated potent activity against numerous gram-positive species. in this study, single-step mutation frequencies, passaging and the activity of tr-700 were tested against a worldwide collection of linezolid-non-susceptible organisms and matched controls. methods: one hundred and twenty linezolid-non-susceptible and 120 controls matched by genus/species, geographic origin, site of infection and time were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. species of isolates were: enterococcus faecalis (16 linezolid non-susceptible/16  wild-type strains); enterococcus faecium (55/55), staphylococcus aureus (8/8); coagulase-negative staphylococci (at least 7 spp., 40/40) and viridans group streptococci (2 spp., 1/1). 23s rrna target mutations or cfr genes were detected  by pcr and sequencing. results: among linezolid-non-susceptible strains, the resistance mechanisms were g2576t (109), cfr (4) and unknown (7), with strains originating from europe, far east and north and south america. most strains were  multidrug-resistant and cfr isolates exhibited co-resistance to phenicols, clindamycin, linezolid, pleuromutilins and streptogramin b. tr-700 mic values, regardless of species, were 4-32-fold lower than those of linezolid. tr-700 mic results were < or = 4, < or = 8 or < or = 16 mg/l for 88%, 96% and > 99% of linezolid-non-susceptible strains, respectively. spontaneous single-step mutations were undetected (<1.1 x 10(-9)) and 14 day passaging studies produced modest tr-700 mic elevations compared with linezolid controls. conclusions: tr-700 exhibited enhanced activity against linezolid-non-susceptible and wild-type control strains of gram-positive cocci. a significant number (nearly 90%) of linezolid-non-susceptible strains were inhibited by potentially achievable levels (< or = 4 mg/l) of tr-700. all strains with the emerging cfr-mediated resistance determinant had tr-700 mic results at < or = 8 mg/l.

TI  == current status of newer carbapenems.
AB  == objectives: beta-lactam antibiotics represent the most commonly prescribed antibacterial agents. since many bacteria have developed resistance to older agents, new beta-lactams have been introduced constantly. in the late 1970s, a new class of exceptionally broad-spectrum beta-lactams, the carbapenems, was identified. the carbapenems, such as the most popular imipenem and meropenem, have the widest spectra of antibacterial activity of all the beta-lactams and provide excellent coverage of many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. despite the wide antibacterial spectrum, the carbapenems globally lack activity against enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. methods: we reviewed the principal characteristics of the novel carbapenems and their clinical implications. results and conclusions: we included in our review: ertapenem, biapenem, panipenem, doripenem, tebipenem pivoxil and tomopenem.

TI  == design and synthesis of new hydroxyethylamines as inhibitors of d-alanyl-d-lactate ligase (vana) and d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase (ddlb).
AB  == the van enzymes are atp-dependant ligases responsible for resistance to vancomycin in staphylococcus aureus and enteroccoccus species. the de novo molecular design programme sprout was used in conjunction with the x-ray crystal  structure of enterococcus faeciumd-alanyl-d-lactate ligase (vana) to design new putative inhibitors based on a hydroxyethylamine template. the two best ranked structures were selected and efficient syntheses developed. the inhibitory activities of these molecules were determined on e. faecium vana, and due to structural similarity and a common reaction mechanism, also on d-ala-d-ala ligase (ddlb) from escherichia coli. the phosphate group attached to the hydroxyl moiety of the hydroxyethylamine isostere within these systems is essential for their inhibitory activity against both vana and ddlb.

TI  == cross-immunity and immune mimicry as mechanisms of resistance to the lantibiotic  lacticin 3147.
AB  == lantibiotics are antimicrobial peptides that possess great potential as clinical  therapeutic agents. these peptides exhibit many beneficial traits and in many cases the emergence of resistance is extremely rare. in contrast, producers of lantibiotics synthesize dedicated immunity proteins to provide self-protection. these proteins have very specific activities and cross-immunity is rare. however, producers of two peptide lantibiotics, such as lacticin 3147, face the unusual challenge of exposure to two active peptides (alpha and beta). here, in addition  to establishing the contribution of ltni and ltnfe to lacticin 3147 immunity, investigations were carried out to determine if production of a closely related lantibiotic (i.e. staphylococcin c55) or possession of ltni/ltnfe homologues could provide protection. here we establish that not only are staphylococcin c55  producers cross-immune to lacticin 3147, and therefore represent a natural repository of staphylococcus aureus strains that are protected against lacticin 3147, but that functional immunity homologues are also produced by strains of bacillus licheniformis and enterococcus faecium. this result raises the spectre of resistance through immune mimicry, i.e. the emergence of lantibiotic-resistant strains from the environment resulting from the possession/acquisition of immunity gene homologues. these phenomena will have to be considered carefully when developing lantibiotics for clinical application.

TI  == monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  == the objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (btm), as well as to clarify the  relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc). the purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for btscc at the population level. samples of btm were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. counts of specific mammary pathogens in btm samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. significant differences were documented in btscc between btm samples containing str. agalactiae, staph. aureus, and str. dysgalactiae and btm samples that were pathogen-free. geometric means of btscc associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall btscc (str. agalactiae 243 628; staph. aureus  205 610; str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). it follows that the somatic cell count (scc) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall btscc. environmental pathogens predominated in samples of btm with scc <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in btm samples with scc >300x103/ml. no correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and btscc. this study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of btm in relation to btscc is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.

TI  == characterization of anti-listeria bacteriocins isolated from shellfish: potential antimicrobials to control non-fermented seafood.
AB  == this work had as main objectives to characterize two bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) previously isolated from non-fermented seafood, in order to evaluate their potential as new food protective agents. the two bacteriocinogenic isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using genus- and species-specific primers, and confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing,  as enterococcus faecium and pediococcus pentosaceus. the antimicrobial spectrum of each strain included several indicator microorganisms, some of them also isolated from seafood. growth of listeria innocua, l. monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus and other lab species were inhibited, although no inhibition of gram-negative microorganisms was observed. proteolytic, but not lipolytic or glycolytic enzymes, completely inactivated the antimicrobial effect of both cell-free supernatants confirming the proteinaceous nature of the  inhibitors. the antimicrobial activity was maintained after treatment with nacl,  sds, triton x-100, tween 20, tween 80 and edta after 2 h or 5 h of exposure and both bacteriocins were stable over a wide range of ph and temperatures. production of bacteriocin by e. faecium (bacalp7) was detected initially at exponential phase and reached a maximum activity of 25,600 au/ml in the early stationary phase, whereas bacteriocin production by p. pentosaceus alp57 (bacalp57) reached the maximum at exponential phase with 12,800 au/ml. the bacteriocins did not kill l. monocytogenes esb54 nor l. innocua 2030c however, cellular growth was reduced. the partially purified bacteriocins, bacalp7 and bacalp57, were below 6.5 kda in size as determined by tricine-sds gel electrophoresis. e. faecium and p. pentosaceus contained dna fragments corresponding in size to those recorded for enterocin b and pediocin pa-1, respectively. sequencing of the fragments from both bacteriocins confirmed the homology. to our knowledge, for the first time two lab producing bacteriocins similar to pediocin pa-1 and enterocin b, were isolated from non-fermented shellfish. the adaptation of the cultures to seafood matrices may be advantageous in terms of application as a biopreservation strategy for reduction of l. monocytogenes levels in seafood products.

TI  == united states resistance surveillance results for linezolid (leader program for 2007).
AB  == the leader program (2007) monitors for emerging linezolid resistance in sampled us medical centers, initiated in 2004. for the current reported year, the number  of sites participating was increased from 50 to 60 institutions representing all  9 us census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6305 isolates, 105.1% compliance to protocol design). the organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were staphylococcus aureus (3318), coagulase negative staphylococci (cons, 1020), enterococci (705), streptococcus pneumoniae (622), and viridans group (249) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (391); also, d-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in s. aureus strains. linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with mic(90) results ranging from 1 microg/ml (streptococci and cons) to 2 microg/ml (s. aureus and enterococci). only 0.44% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, compared with 0.45% in 2006. the nonsusceptible strains (23) were usually staphylococci (20) or enterococcus faecium (8), each with defined target mutations (g2576t, 24 strains) or a novel mobile cfr element in staphylococci (2  strains). in conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 4th year of this leader program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.56% susceptibility). although the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable, a new plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism emerged in s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains from arizona and ohio. the leader program appears to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect novel resistance phenotypes and genotypes.

TI  == enterococcal infections & antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == enterococci have traditionally regarded as low grade pathogens, have emerged as an increasingly important cause of nosocomial infections in the last decade. although about a dozen enterococcus species have been identified, only two are responsible for the majority of human infections, i.e., enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. the most common nosocomial infections produced by these organisms are urinary tract infections (associated with instrumentation and antimicrobial resistance), followed by intra-abdominal and pelvic infections. they also cause surgical wound infections, bacteraemia, endocarditis, neonatal sepsis and rarely  meningitis. a major reason why these organisms survive in hospital environment is the intrinsic resistance to several commonly used antibiotics and, perhaps more importantly, their ability to acquire resistance to all currently available antibiotics, either by mutation or by receipt of foreign genetic material through the transfer of plasmids and transposons. the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) is a cause of concern, as once established, it is very difficult to control. moreover, there can be transfer of resistant gene from enterococci to staphylococcus aureus thereby posing a threat to the patient safety and also challenges for the treating physicians. this review highlights the shifting spectrum of enterococcal infections, along with their geographical distribution and growing nosocomial importance. emergence of antimicrobial resistance, pathogenicity and virulence factors, current preventive, control and  treatment modalities of severe enterococcal infections are also dealt with.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) outbreak at a university hospital in kitakyushu, japan: case-control studies.
AB  == at a university hospital in japan, a total of 15 patients (14 adults and 1 newborn baby) with vancomycinresistant enterococci (vre) infection or colonization (inf/col) were identified via routine clinical examinations and two  nonroutine examinations from january to april 2007. two case-control studies were conducted to identify the factors related to vre inf/col. in study 1, the patients with vre inf/col from ward a (n = 8) were compared with all of the patients without vre isolates in the same ward, i.e., the controls (n = 26). in study 2, all adult patients with vre inf/col throughout the hospital (n = 14) were compared with controls randomly selected from among all patients without vre isolates (n = 45). all the subject cases were found to be infected or colonized with enterococcus faecium, vanb. all but two of the isolated strains were completely identical according to pulsed field gel electrophoresis. univariate analysis in study 2 showed several factors, including the isolation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (odds ratio [or], 8.6; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.3-53.7) and the use of antibiotics other than anti-mrsa drugs (or, 33.0; 95% ci, 1.8-587.6) to be risk factors for vre inf/col. multivariate logistic regression analysis in study 2 demonstrated associations with vre inf/col in the use of an ultrasound nebulizer (or, 5.9; 95% ci, 1.5-22.8) and extended bed rest (or, 3.8; 95% ci, 1.02-24.5). although severe infection with vre did not occur, to avoid the spread of vre in hospital wards, further staff education should be implemented in regard to the usual standard and contact precautions, and the appropriate selection of antibiotics.

TI  == [emergence of vancomycin-dependent enterococci following glycopeptide therapy: case report and review].
AB  == introduction: outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been increasingly reported in france over the last three years. we report here, the emergence of a vancomycin-dependent enterococci isolate following glycopeptide therapy. patients and methods: an enterococcus faecium isolate that required vancomycin for growth was cultured from the stools of a liver transplant recipient who was colonised with vancomycin-resistant enterococci and who received vancomycin treatment for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection. the resistant isolate and the dependent isolate were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the sequence of the ddl gene coding for the d-ala: d-ala ligase was analysed. results: the dependent isolate was primary cultured onto a vancomycin-containing screening medium and could not be subcultured in the absence of vancomycin. both the resistant and dependent isolates harboured the vana gene and they had the same dna restriction pattern after pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. dependence on vancomycin was associated with a 1-bp deletion in the d-ala: d-ala ligase gene leading to an early stop odon. conclusion: cultures onto vancomycin-containing media are warranted for clinical specimens from patients, who are known to carry vancomycin-resistant enterococci and receive vancomycin therapy.

TI  == development and application of the active surveillance of pathogens microarray to monitor bacterial gene flux.
AB  == background: human and animal health is constantly under threat by emerging pathogens that have recently acquired genetic determinants that enhance their survival, transmissibility and virulence. we describe the construction and development of an active surveillance of pathogens (asp) oligonucleotide microarray, designed to 'actively survey' the genome of a given bacterial pathogen for virulence-associated genes. results: the microarray consists of 4958 reporters from 151 bacterial species and include genes for the identification of  individual bacterial species as well as mobile genetic elements (transposons, plasmid and phage), virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes. the asp microarray was validated with nineteen bacterial pathogens species, including francisella tularensis, clostridium difficile, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the asp microarray identified these bacteria, and provided information on potential antibiotic resistance (eg sufamethoxazole resistance and sulfonamide resistance) and virulence determinants including genes likely to be acquired by horizontal gene transfer (e.g. an alpha-haemolysin). conclusion: the asp microarray has potential in the clinic as a diagnostic tool, as a research tool for both known and emerging pathogens, and as an early warning system for pathogenic bacteria that have been recently modified either naturally or deliberately.

TI  == lynamicins a-e, chlorinated bisindole pyrrole antibiotics from a novel marine actinomycete.
AB  == a series of chlorinated bisindole pyrroles, lynamicins a-e (1-5), was discovered  from a novel marine actinomycete, nps12745, which was isolated from a marine sediment collected off the coast of san diego, california. close to full length 16s rrna sequence analysis indicated that nps12745 is a novel strain of a recently described marine actinomycete with the proposed genus name marinispora.  the antimicrobial spectrum of these compounds was evaluated against a panel of 11 pathogens, which demonstrated that these substances possess broad-spectrum activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. significantly, compounds 1-5 were active against drug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium.

TI  == acquired vancomycin resistance in clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  == acquired resistance to vancomycin is an increasing problem in pathogenic bacteria. it is best studied and most prevalent among enterococcus and still remains rare in other pathogenic bacteria. different genotypes of vancomycin resistance, vana-g, have been described. the different van gene clusters consist  of up to nine genes encoding proteins of different functions; their interplay leads to an alternative cell wall precursor less susceptible to glycopeptide binding. variants of vana and vanb types are found worldwide, with vana predominating; their reservoir is enterococcus faecium. within this species a subpopulation of hospital-adapted types exists that acquired van gene clusters and which is responsible for outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant enterococci all over the world. acquisition of vana by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is worrisome and seven cases have been described. nonsusceptibility to glycopeptides also occurs independently from van genes and is a growing therapeutic challenge, especially in mrsa.

TI  == vancomycin resistance vans/vanr two-component systems.
AB  == vancomycin is a member of the glycopeptide class of antibiotics. vancomycin resistance (van) gene clusters are found in human pathogens such as enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-producing  actinomycetes such as amycolotopsis orientalis, actinoplanes teichomyceticus and  streptomyces toyocaensis and the nonglycopeptide producing actinomycete streptomyces coelicolor. expression of the van genes is activated by the vans/vanr two-component system in response to extracellular glycopeptide antibiotic. two major types of inducible vancomycin resistance are found in pathogenic bacteria; vana strains are resistant to vancomycin itself and also to  the lipidated glycopeptide teicoplanin, while vanb strains are resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to teicoplanin. here we discuss the enzymes the van genes encode, the range of different vans/vanr two-component systems, the biochemistry of vans/vanr, the nature of the effector ligand(s) recognised by vans and the evolution of the van cluster.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in greece.
AB  == a total of 10420 gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to  daptomycin. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by the broth microdilution method. daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (mic50) =  1mg/l and mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90) = 1.36 mg/l), enterococcus faecium (mic50 = 1.36 mg/l and mic90 = 1.90 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (mic50 = 0.12 mg/l and mic90 = 0.50mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (mic50 = 0.09 mg/l and mic90 = 0.12 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.5 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50 = 0.50 mg/l and mic90 = 0.89 mg/l). resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. on the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic50 = 0.44 mg/l and mic90 = 0.78 mg/l) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic50 = 0.24 mg/l and mic90 = 0.44 mg/l); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an mic > 1mg/l, which is the clinical and laboratory standards institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. for all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) accelerates identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  == sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. to accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) targeting gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. by combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium/durans. furthermore, the newly designed fish probes strep2, enco and granu targeted streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, enterococcus spp. (except e. faecalis) and granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. the fish assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and  reliable molecular identification of gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.

TI  == characterization of the peptidoglycan of vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium.
AB  == vancomycin and other antibacterial glycopeptide analogues target the cell wall and affect the enzymatic processes involved with cell-wall biosynthesis. understanding the structure and organization of the peptidoglycan is the first step in establishing the mode of action of these glycopeptides. we have used solid-state nmr to determine the relative concentrations of stem-links (64%), bridge-links (61%), and cross-links (49%) in the cell walls of vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium (attc 49624). furthermore, we have determined that in vivo only 7% of the peptidoglycan stems terminate in d-ala- d-ala, the well-known vancomycin-binding site. presumably, d-ala- d-ala is cleaved from uncross-linked stems in mature peptidoglycan by an active carboxypeptidase. we believe that most of the few pentapeptide stems ending in d-ala- d-ala occur in the template and nascent peptidoglycan strands that are crucial for cell-wall biosynthesis.

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. data sources: literature identification was conducted through medline (1966-february 2008) and international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970-february 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, bal 5788, ro-5788, bal 9141, ro 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, mrsa, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. study selection and data extraction: all articles in english were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. data synthesis: ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecium. preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for csssis. ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive csssis, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial csssis (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. conclusions: the  activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful  as empiric monotherapy for csssi and in combination with other antimicrobials in  lower respiratory tract infections for which phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. approval is expected for the treatment of csssi.

TI  == design and synthesis of benzenesulfonanilides active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
AB  == vancomycin is mainly used as an antibacterial agent of last resort, but recently  vancomycin-resistant bacterial strains have been emerging. although new antimicrobials have been developed in order to overcome drug-resistant bacteria,  many are structurally complex beta-lactams or quinolones. in this study, we aimed to create new anti-drug-resistance antibacterials which can be synthesized in a few steps from inexpensive starting materials. since sulfa drugs function as p-aminobenzoic acid mimics and inhibit dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) in the folate pathway, we hypothesized that sulfa derivatives would act as folate metabolite-mimics and inhibit bacterial folate metabolism. screening of our sulfonanilide libraries, including benzenesulfonanilide-type cyclooxygenase-1-selective inhibitors, led us to discover benzenesulfonanilides with potent anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)/vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) activity, that is, n-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-3,5-dichlorobenzenesulfonanilide (16b) [mic=0.5microg/ml (mrsa), 1.0microg/ml (vre)], and 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-n-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)benzenesulfonanilide (16c) [mic=0.5microg/ml (mrsa), 1.0microg/ml (vre)]. these compounds are more active than vancomycin [mic=2.0microg/ml (mrsa), 125microg/ml (vre)], but do not possess an amino group, which is essential for dhps inhibition by sulfa drugs. these results suggested that the mechanism of antibacterial action of compounds 16b and 16c is different from that of sulfa drugs. we also confirmed the activity of these compounds against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == a novel marine actinomycete strain nps8920 produces a new class of 4-oxazolidinone antibiotics lipoxazolidinone a, b and c. lipoxazolidinone a possesses good potency (1-2 microg/ml) against drug-resistant pathogens methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre). strain nps8920 exhibits different morphologies in both agar and submerged cultures. the ability of strain nps8920 to sporulate on saline-based agar media but not on deionized water-based agar medium supported that strain nps8920 is a marine actinomycete. while strain nps8920 does not require seawater for growth, the production of lipoxazolidinones by strain nps8920 can only be detected in the seawater-based media. the optimal production  of lipoxazolidinones was observed in the natural seawater-based medium. strain nps8920 produced 10-20% of lipoxazolidinones in the synthetic sea salt instant ocean-based medium and no production in the sodium chloride-based and deionized water-based media.

AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == update on the appropriate use of linezolid in clinical practice.
AB  == multi-antibiotic resistant gram-positive cocci, which include staphylococcus aureus, the coagulase-negative staphylococcal group, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and other streptococci, represent emerging pathogens especially in the setting of the immunocompromised, hospitalized patients, in particular when surgery, invasive procedures, or prosthetic implants are of concern, patients are admitted in intensive care units, or underlying chronic disorders and immunodeficiency are of concern, and broad-spectrum antibiotics or  immunosuppressive drugs are widely administered. during the recent years, the phenomenon of multiresistant gram-positive cocci is spreading to the community, where the retrieval of such microorganism is progressively increasing. the spectrum of available antimicrobial compounds for an effective management of these relevant infections is significantly impaired in selection and clinical efficacy by the emerging and spread of methicillin-resistant and more recently glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive microbial strains. the first oxazolidinone derivative linezolid, together with the recently licensed quinupristin-dalfopristin, daptomycin, and tigecycline, followed by a number of glycopeptides, fluoroquinolones, and other experimental compounds on the pipeline, represent an effective response to the great majority of these concerns, due to their innovative mechanisms of action, their maintained or enhanced activity against multiresistant pathogens, their effective pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, their frequent possibility of synergistic activity with other compounds effective against gram-positive pathogens, and a diffuse potential for a safe and easy administration, also when  compromised patients are of concern. the main problems related to the epidemiological and clinical features of multiresistant gram-positive infection,  the potential clinical indications of all recently available compounds compared with the standard of care of treatment of resistant gram-positive infections, and updated data on efficacy and tolerability of linezolid as the golden standard compound for vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci in multiple clinical situations, are outlined and updated on the ground of an extensive review of all  the available, recent evidences coming from the international literature.

TI  == detection of daptomycin-nonsusceptible strains using the neo-sensitab prediffusion method.
AB  == two prediffusion methods with daptomycin (dap) neo-sensitabs were evaluated against a challenge set of 30 staphylococcus aureus isolates and 30 enterococci.  dap neo-sensitabs were prediffused for either 8 or 20 h on mueller-hinton agar. inhibition zones were plotted versus etest mic values determined on the same prediffused agar. a generalization to the genus level of the manufacturer's suggested neo-sensitabs breakpoints for staphylococci and enterococci was used to interpret the results. dap-susceptible and dap-nonsusceptible enterococci, enterococcus faecium in particular, were not reliably discriminated using a 20-h  prediffusion method and the manufacturer's suggested breakpoints. further development of this testing methodology, such as changing the format to a susceptibility screen followed by a confirmatory mic, is needed to accurately categorize the dap susceptibility of enterococcal isolates. prediffusion for either 8 or 20 h with dap neo-sensitabs discriminated between susceptible and nonsusceptible s. aureus with minimal errors. both prediffusion methods also detected changes in mic values between isogenic pairs of susceptible and nonsusceptible s. aureus. these results suggest that a multisite evaluation of either prediffusion method with dap neo-sensitabs against a larger collection of  s. aureus is warranted.

TI  == emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  == development of multiple resistances to antibiotics in staphylococci, enterococci  and pneumococci became a health threat during the past 20 years, not only with respect to nosocomial infections. this resistance development is based on acquisition of resistance genes by predominant epidemic subpopulations (clonal complexes). although emergence and spread of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus is associated with a limited number of epidemic clones which have been widely disseminated, acquisition of sccmec elements by susceptible ancestors has  taken place at different times and at different locations. among staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium, one clonal complex, which had acquired resistance genes at several occasions, is widely disseminated in hospitals. also  in streptococcus pneumoniae, antibiotic resistance is preferentially associated with clonal lineages which have a capacity for spreading. they became, however, more rare after introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of heyneanol a extracted from the root of taiwanese wild grape.
AB  == aims: to search for antimicrobial compounds against pathogenic bacteria from grape vines (vitis spp.). to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of active compounds towards methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). methods and results: the root extracts of taiwanese wild grape (vitis thunbergii var. taiwaniana) showed marked activities against gram-positive bacteria using the disc diffusion method. after purification, the active compound 1 was confirmed as heyneanol a by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. heyneanol a showed an minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 2 microg ml(-1) towards mrsa and a value of 2 to 4 microg ml(-1) for enterococcus faecium, s. aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes. in addition, the contents of heyneanol a were determined as 36 mg g(-1) in roots of taiwanese wild grape. conclusions: the root extracts of grapevines have good antimicrobial activities towards some strains of gram-positive pathogens. heyneanol a, the major antimicrobial compound, is especially active towards mrsa. in addition, the abundances of heyneanol a and other stilbenes in the roots of grapevines make it  possible to produce natural antimicrobial compounds from this plant species. significance and impact of the study: this study reports for the first time the antimicrobial compounds in the root extracts of grapevines. the results will have clinical significance owing to their activities against mrsa.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of omiganan pentahydrochloride tested against contemporary bacterial pathogens commonly responsible for catheter-associated infections.
AB  == objectives: omiganan pentahydrochloride is a cidal cationic peptide with a broad  antimicrobial spectrum, including yeast, currently in development as a topical agent for the prevention of catheter-associated infections. we evaluated the spectrum and potency of omiganan against pathogens commonly associated with such  infections. methods: a recent (2005-06) collection of bacterial isolates originating from patients with bloodstream, respiratory tract, and skin and skin  structure infections in us medical centres was evaluated by reference broth microdilution methods against omiganan and comparator agents. results: all tested gram-positive (390) and -negative (167) isolates were inhibited by < or = 128 and < or = 1024 mg/l, respectively, of omiganan. the agent was the most active against coagulase-negative staphylococci (range 1-8 mg/l; mic(50/90), 4 mg/l) and inhibited all staphylococcus aureus at < or = 32 mg/l (mic(50/90), 16 mg/l). omiganan was 16-fold more active against enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis (mic(50/90) results, 4/8 versus 64/128 mg/l, respectively). mic ranges and mic(50) potencies were unaffected by methicillin resistance in staphylococci, vancomycin resistance in enterococci, and penicillin resistance in streptococci.  omiganan potency was also unaffected by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in escherichia coli when compared with wild-type strains (mic(50) values 32 mg/l), although a 4-fold increase was noted among esbl-positive klebsiella spp. (128 versus 32 mg/l, respectively). wild-type enterobacter spp. displayed higher omiganan mic(50/90) results (64/512 mg/l) compared with ampc-hyperproducing strains (32/64 mg/l). carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant p. aeruginosa strains exhibited omiganan mic(50/90) values of 128/256 mg/l. conclusions: at a 1% (10 000 mg/l) topical gel formulation, omiganan can be expected to inhibit all clinically relevant bacterial species producing catheter-associated infections (all mic values, < or = 1024 mg/l), including those with antimicrobial-resistant phenotypes.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of dx-619, a novel des-f (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of dx-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in china. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of antimicrobials were determined by a clsi recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs)  were examined by the broth dilution method. time-kill curves against representative isolates of staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. dx-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci. the mic(90)s of dx-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/l against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. the mic(90)s of dx-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. the mic(90)s of dx-619 against enterobacteriaceae (except for escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/l, which were comparable to other comparators. mbcs and time-kill curves showed that dx-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. there was no significant inoculum effect on mics. but the activities of dx-619 against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic ph and  human serum. dx-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including gram-positive cocci, such as s. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.

TI  == linezolid in children: recent patents and advances.
AB  == linezolid is the first approved member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. it has an excellent bioavailability both intravenously and orally and a very good safety profile both in adults and in children. with regards to its antimicrobial action, linezolid has a predominantly bacteriostatic action, rather than a bacteriocidal effect and is active against gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. linezolid is currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive infections, both in the community and in a hospital setting. clinical indications so far include skin and soft tissue infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia due to mrsa, vre bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. we anticipate that this new generation of antimicrobial agents will provide adequate cover in the future for infections that cause significant treatment failures so far, such as vre- associated endocarditis, bone and joint multi-drug resistant infections and possibly central nervous system infections, both in adult and children populations. some patents on linezolid are also discussed in this review.

TI  == response to emerging infection leading to outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci.
AB  == linezolid was approved in 2000 for treatment of gram-positive coccal infections.  we performed a case-control study during a hospital outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci (lre) infections, comparing cases of lre infection (cases) with linezolid-sensitive enterococci infections (controls). nasal and perirectal swab samples were obtained from all patients in a 1-day point-prevalence survey. we examined antimicrobial drug use and calculated the defined daily dose of linezolid per 1,000 patient-days. fifteen lre cases were identified (13 enterococcus faecalis and 2 e. faecium); 7 were vancomycin-resistant. compared with controls, case-patients had increased in-hospital mortality rates and lengths of stay. multivariate analysis identified independent predictors of lre infection: prior cultures positive for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (adjusted odds ratio [aor] 27), hospitalization duration before index culture (aor 1.1 per day), and duration of  preceding linezolid therapy (aor 1.1 per day). linezolid exposure and patient-to-patient transmission appear to be responsible for lre infections, an important emeraina hospital problem.

AB  == antimicrobial activities of 139 enterococcus isolates (48 e. faecium and 91 e. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, and escherichia coli. bacteriocin (bac) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least  one of 6 indicator strains (bac+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 e. faecium and 22 e. faecalis). twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (enta, entb, entl50ab, and cyll) showed a bac+  phenotype. the existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied  because the bac+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. the antimicrobial activity against gram-negative strains (salmonella enteritidis and e. coli) was detected in the 6  enterococcus isolates that had either the enta, entb, entl50ab or cyll genes. moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against l. monocytogenes among the cyll-positive e. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). the results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.

TI  == endocarditis in burn patients: clinical and diagnostic considerations.
AB  == background: burned patients are at high risk for invasive procedures, bacteremia, and other infectious complications. previous publications describe high incidence, delayed diagnosis, and high mortality for endocarditis in burned patients, but do not address use of contemporary diagnostic criteria. further analysis of the clinical presentation and diagnosis may aid in the earlier recognition and decreased mortality of endocarditis in burned patients. methods:  at a 40 bed burn center, during the period from 1 january 2003 to 1 august 2006,  blood culture, electronic inpatient, echocardiographic, and autopsy records were  reviewed for cases of endocarditis and persistent bacteremia (blood culture positivity for the same organism separated by 24h). in addition, we reviewed cases of burn-related bacterial endocarditis published in the english language. we compared the clinical and diagnostic aspects of our identified cases with those in the published literature. results: there were 90 episodes of persistent  bacteremia or fungemia in 56 of 1250 patients admitted during the study period. echocardiography was performed on 19, identifying 4 cases of endocarditis. one additional case of endocarditis was identified post-mortem. time until echocardiography ranged from 6 to 176 days after onset of bacteremia. case patient age ranged from 31 to 64 years, and total burn surface area ranged from 34 to 80%. endocarditis occurred in 0.4% of burn unit admissions and in 8.9% of these patients with persistent bacteremia. sites involved included the mitral valve (3), tricuspid valve (2), aortic valve (1), and pulmonic valve (1). pathogens included staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one case of enterococcus faecium. diagnostic clues were minimal. case mortality was 100%. a literature review revealed 17 publications describing confirmed bacterial endocarditis in burned patients. these cases revealed a predilection for infection by s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, a relative paucity of diagnostic clues  prior to death, and a trend towards ante-mortem diagnosis and increased survival  with use of diagnostic echocardiography. conclusions: the incidence and mortality of endocarditis in burned patients remain high. clinical clues for endocarditis in this cohort are minimal and diagnosis may be delayed. for burned patients with persistent bacteremia, especially s. aureus or p. aeruginosa of unknown source, the diagnosis of endocarditis should be entertained and early echocardiography considered.

TI  == frequent detection of multidrug-resistant pneumonia-causing bacteria in the pneumonia lung tissues of patients with hematological malignancies.
AB  == pneumonia is a critical issue during the agonal phase, and often becomes lethal in the absence of pathogen detection. autopsy is a powerful tool for analyzing the cause of a patient's death, progression of the disease, and the therapeutic response. however, it is frequently limited to the identification of bacterial strains. to elucidate the pathogenesis during the agonal phase of pneumonia, intrapulmonary sputum was harvested by directly inserting a swab into a resected  lung, and the bacterial composition was analyzed using both pathological and microbiological techniques from 15 patients with hematological malignancies, and  the results were compared with those from 25 patients with other medical and surgical diseases. among the 54 bacteria strains isolated from the 40 patients, multidrug-resistant strains were significantly more prevalent in hematological group than in other diseases (16/21 versus 11/33, p = .002). enterococcus faecium was preferentially isolated from the hematological patients, whereas the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was predominantly found in the nonhematological group. two coagulase-negative staphylococcus epidermidis strains in hematological diseases may be diagnosed as causative bacteria of pneumonia by  both bacterial and pathological techniques. although the results of this study may not be directly applicable for clinical diagnosis, this approach has a potential to become not only a diagnostic method for bacterial pneumonia, but may be also useful for the analysis of multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == experience with linezolid therapy in children with osteoarticular infections.
AB  == background: the excellent oral bioavailability and the gram-positive antimicrobial spectrum make linezolid an attractive antibiotic for treatment of osteoarticular infections. the clinical efficacy of this drug has not been previously evaluated for gram-positive osteoarticular infections in children. methods: between july 2003 and june 2006, 13 children who received a linezolid-containing regimen for osteoarticular infections were identified from a hospital pharmacy database. the medical records were reviewed and outcomes with regard to clinical efficacy and safety were analyzed. results: eight (61.5%) children were male. ages ranged from 3 months to 14 years. nine previously healthy children had acute hematogenous osteoarticular infections involving the pelvis (n = 1) or lower limbs (n = 8). the remaining 4 children had postoperative infections of sternal wounds (n = 2) and fractured lower limbs (n = 2). causative pathogens included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in 11 children, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus in one, and enterococcus faecium and coagulase-negative staphylococci in one. surgical debridement was attempted in 9  children and effective antistaphylococcal antibiotics were used in all 13 patients for a median duration of 23 days (range, 5-41 days) before the use of linezolid. linezolid was administered orally to 10 children as step-down therapy  and by the parenteral followed by oral route to 3 children who were intolerant of glycopeptide for a median duration of 20 days (range, 9-36 days). eleven of the 13 children were cured after management. two children developed anemia during linezolid therapy. there was no premature cessation of linezolid because of severe adverse effects. conclusion: linezolid appears to be useful and well tolerated in step-down therapy or compassionate use for pediatric gram-positive orthopedic infections. a well-designed prospective comparative study is needed to confirm this observation.

TI  == inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  == objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14  h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.

TI  == comparative analysis of the bactericidal activities of amphibian peptide analogues against multidrug-resistant nosocomial bacterial strains.
AB  == due to the widespread resistance of bacteria to the available drugs, the discovery of new classes of antibiotics is urgently needed, and naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (amps) are considered promising candidates for future therapeutic use. amphibian skin is one of the richest sources of such amps. in the present study we compared the in vitro bactericidal activities of five amps from three different species of anurans against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates belonging to species often involved in nosocomial infections (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter baumannii). the peptides tested were temporins a, b, and g from rana temporaria; the fragment from positions 1 to 18 of esculentin 1b [esc(1-18)] from rana esculenta; and bombinin h2 from bombina variegata. when they were tested in buffer, all the peptides were bactericidal against all bacterial species tested (three strains of each species) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 48 microm, with only a few exceptions. the temporins were found to be more active against gram-positive bacteria, especially when they were assayed in human serum; esc(1-18) showed fast and strong bactericidal activity, within 2 to 20 min, especially against the gram-negative species, which were killed by esc(1-18) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1 microm; bombinin h2 displayed similar bactericidal activity toward all isolates.  interestingly, while the activities of the temporins and bombinin h2 were almost  completely inhibited in the presence of 20% human serum, the activity of esc(1-18) against the gram-negative species was partially preserved in the presence of 40% serum. this property renders this peptide an attractive molecule  for use in the development of new compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases.

TI  == distribution of resistant gram-positive organisms across the census regions of the united states and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  == background: gram-positive isolates were collected from 76 medical centers within  the 9 census regions across the united states. methods: antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined according to clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. results: vancomycin resistance among enterococcus faecium isolates varied from 45.5% (new england) to 85.3% (east south central). the lowest concentrations at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90) were for tigecycline (0.06-0.12 microg/ml) and for linezolid (2-4 microg/ml). methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) varied from 27.4% (new england) to 62.4% (east south central). all mrsa were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 23.3% in the pacific region to 54.5% in the east south central region. tigecycline, imipenem, levofloxacin, linezolid, and vancomycin all maintained mic90 of < or =1 microg/ml against penicillin-nonsusceptible s pneumoniae in vitro, irrespective of region. conclusion: this study demonstrates  the variable rate of antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive organisms in the united states. tigecycline may make a useful addition to the antimicrobial armamentarium.

TI  == bactericidal activity of extended 9-glycyl-amido-minocyclines.
AB  == the need for self-protecting polymer or alloy implants resistant to a broad spectrum of bacterial challenges led us to investigate covalent bonding of minocycline (min), a tetracycline derivative, to polystyrene beads and to titanium alloy foils by oligoethylene glycol spacers. 9-hydrazino-acetyl-amido-min, and simpler glycylcycline derivatives, retained minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against staphylococcus aureus comparable to min. however, peg-glycyl-amido-min showed very low activity. hence, we coupled 9-hydrazino-acetyl-amido-min to the aldehyde termini of oligoethylene glycol spacers bonded to polystyrene and titanium alloy surfaces to form acid-releasable hydrazone linkages. 9-hydrazino-acetyl-amido-min was released from the monolayers more rapidly at ph 5.0 than at ph 7.4.

TI  == preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  == the aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. one hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. on the basis of these results,  80% alcohol, octenidine 0.1%, and chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro  model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. the results of  the questionnaire revealed that chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and octenidine by 7% of the dentists. using the in vitro model, with the exception of s. aureus, chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. in contrast, the treatment with octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. the 80% alcohol was more efficient. no growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. on the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be  preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or octenidine using an incubation time  of 15 min with ultrasonication.

AB  == the zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program has completed its fifth year of monitoring for emerging resistance to linezolid and other gram-positive active agents on the continents of europe, asia, australia, and latin america. in 2006, 4216 gram-positive isolates from 16 nations were submitted for analysis from 6 organism groups including staphylococcus aureus (54.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (14.6%), enterococci (10.0%), streptococcus pneumoniae (9.4%), viridans group streptococci (5.0%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (7.0%). linezolid retained potent activity against s. aureus (mic(50) and mic(90), 2 microg/ml; 39.8% methicillin resistant) and cons (mic(50) and mic(90), 1 microg/ml; 74.3% methicillin resistant). despite endemicity of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (up to 30.0%) in several nations,  linezolid inhibited >99% of strains at </=2 microg/ml (modal mic, 1 microg/ml). among streptococci, all linezolid mic values were </=2 microg/ml. rare instances  of linezolid-resistance were detected in enterococci (2 isolates, china and germany) and cons (3 isolates, italy and brazil); 2 cons and 1 enterococcus faecium had documented g2576t mutations. overall, linezolid remained active against 99.88% of tested strains from this global collection.

TI  == functional and structural properties of cbpa, a collagen-binding protein from arcanobacterium pyogenes.
AB  == arcanobacterium pyogenes, an opportunistic pathogen of economically important food animals, is the causative agent of liver abscesses in feedlot cattle, osteomyelitis in turkeys, and pneumonia and arthritis in pigs. previous studies identified the first a. pyogenes adhesin, cbpa, a protein located on the bacterial surface which has the ability to bind collagen and promotes adhesion to the host cells. the protein has an n-terminal ligand-binding region (region a) and a c-terminal repetitive domain (region b). in this study we found that cbpa bound to almost all the collagen types tested but not to other proteins, and it displayed a propensity to interact with several collagenous peptides derived by cnbr cleavage of type i and ii collagens. the k(d) values of cbpa for type i and  ii collagens and collagen peptides determined by solid-phase binding assay and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence were in the range of 1-15 nm. it was also found that cbpa and its a region bound fibronectin, and that collagen and fibronectin interacted with distinct subsites. anti-cbpa antibodies were effective at inhibiting both binding of isolated cbpa and bacterial adhesion to immobilized collagen, suggesting that cbpa is a functional collagen-binding adhesin. analysis of the immunological cross-reactivity of cbpa with antibodies against other bacterial collagen-binding proteins indicated that cbpa is immunologically related to ace from enterococcus faecalis but not to cna from staphylococcus aureus or acm from enterococcus faecium. far-uv and near-uv circular dichroism spectra showed that full-length cbpa and its region a are mainly composed of beta-sheet with only a minor alpha-helical component and that both the proteins have a well-defined tertiary structure.

TI  == new antimicrobial agents as therapy for resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == vancomycin- and methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci have emerged as an increasingly problematic cause of hospital-acquired infections. we conducted a literature review of newer antibiotics with activity against vancomycin-resistant and methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci. quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline have in vitro activity for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and are superior to vancomycin for vancomycin-resistant isolates. dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin are new glycopeptides that have superior pharmacodynamic properties compared to vancomycin. we review the antibacterial spectrum, clinical indications and contraindications, pharmacologic properties, and adverse events associated with each of these agents. daptomycin has rapid bactericidal activity for staphylococcus aureus and is approved for use in bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis. linezolid is comparable to vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) pneumonia and has pharmacoeconomic advantages given its oral formulation. quinupristin/dalfopristin is the drug of choice for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections but has no activity against enterococcus faecalis. tigecycline has activity against both enterococcus species and mrsa; it is also active against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes which allows for use in intra-abdominal and diabetic foot infections. a review of numerous in vitro and animal model studies shows that interaction between these newer agents and other antistaphylococcal agents for s. aureus are  usually indifferent (additive).

TI  == gram-positive bloodstream infections in liver transplant recipients: incidence, risk factors, and impact on survival.
AB  == the objective of the study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and survival of gram-positive bloodstream infections (gp-bsi(s)) among liver transplant recipients during the first year after transplantation. between october 2000 and september 2006, 42 episodes of gp-bsi(s) occurred in 205 patients with an overall incidence of 0.20 episodes/patient. coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected in 45.2% of cases, enterococcus species in 42.9% (e faecalis, eight; e faecium, seven; e avium, two; e gallinarum, one) and staphylococcus aureus in 11.9%. retransplantation was the only independent risk factor for gp-bsi (odds ratio [or], 0.253; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.089 to 0.715; p = .009). thirty-day mortality rate was 28.5% and s aureus infections were related to a poorer outcome. it is noteworthy that all the isolates of s aureus were methicillin-resistant. ampicillin was inactive against all the strains of e faecium and 50% of e avium isolates, but active against all e faecalis and e gallinarum strains. all the isolates were glycopeptide-susceptible. no significant differences in mortality rate were observed in relation to sex, etiologies of end-stage liver disease, cytomegalovirus infection/reinfection, type of donor, rejection, or retransplantation. gp-bsi, the only independent risk factor for death (or, 0.262; 95% ci, 0.106 to 0.643; p = .003), reduced the survival rate by 26% in the first  year posttransplant. in conclusion, gp-bsi(s) impact significantly on morbidity and mortality posttransplant, particularly among retransplantations. control measures are required to reduce the incidence of gp-bsi(s) in liver transplant recipients. these findings must be considered when empirical antimicrobial therapy is indicated while awaiting blood-culture results.

TI  == many fructosamine 3-kinase homologues in bacteria are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases potentially involved in protein deglycation.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to identify the function of bacterial homologues of  fructosamine 3-kinase (fn3k), a mammalian enzyme responsible for the removal of fructosamines from proteins. fn3k homologues were identified in approximately 200 (i.e. approximately 27%) of the sequenced bacterial genomes. in 11 of these genomes, from phylogenetically distant bacteria, the fn3k homologue was immediately preceded by a low-molecular-weight protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (lmw-ptp) homologue, which is therefore probably functionally related to the fn3k homologue. five bacterial fn3k homologues (from escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, staphylococcus aureus and thermus thermophilus) were overexpressed in e. coli, purified and their kinetic properties investigated. four were ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases acting best on free lysine and cadaverine derivatives, but not on ribulosamines bound to the alpha amino group of amino acids. they also phosphorylated protein-bound ribulosamines or erythrulosamines, but not protein-bound fructosamines, therefore having properties similar to those of mammalian fn3k-related protein. the e. coli fn3k homologue (ynia) was inactive on all tested substrates. the lmw-ptp of t. thermophilus, which forms an operon with an fn3k homologue, and an lmw-ptp of s.  aureus (ptpa) were overexpressed in e. coli, purified and shown to dephosphorylate not only protein tyrosine phosphates, but protein ribulosamine 5-phosphates as well as free ribuloselysine 5-phosphate and erythruloselysine 4-phosphate. these lmw-ptps were devoid of ribulosamine 3-phosphatase activity. it is concluded that most bacterial fn3k homologues are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases. they may serve, in conjunction with a phosphatase, to deglycate products of glycation formed from ribose 5-phosphate or erythrose 4-phosphate.

TI  == enterococci and streptococci.
AB  == besides staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive bacteria have become multidrug-resistant and cause therapeutic problems, particularly amongst hospitalised patients. the acquisition of vancomycin resistance by strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis is of particular concern and has resulted in treatment failures. some of the infections caused by these bacteria do respond to treatment with new antibiotics that have been released in the last  few years, however more options are required as not all enterococci are inherently susceptible and resistance is beginning to emerge amongst those that were susceptible. resistance to commonly used antibiotics is also emerging in streptococcus spp., particularly to the tetracyclines and macrolides. in both genera, multiresistant strains spread between patients and between hospitals. in  the laboratory, these bacteria show considerable susceptibility to tigecycline, with little propensity to develop resistance, indicating that tigecycline could assume an important role in controlling infections caused by these gram-positive  bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == predicting microbial heat inactivation under nonisothermal treatments.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop an equation that accurately predicts microbial heat inactivation under nonisothermal treatments at constantly rising heating rates (from 0.5 to 5 degrees c/min) in media with different ph values (4.0 or 7.4). the survival curves of all bacteria (enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella senftenberg 775w, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) tested under isothermal treatments were nearly linear. for the most heat-resistant microorganism (e. faecium), the estimated dt-values at ph 7.4 were at least 100 times those of the second most thermotolerant microorganism (salmonella senftenberg 775w). the heat resistance of e. faecium was up to 30 times lower at ph 4.0 than at ph 7.4. however, e. faecium was still the most heat-resistant microorganism under nonisothermal treatments at both ph values. inactivation under nonisothermal conditions was not accurately estimated from heat resistance parameters of isothermal treatments when microbial adaptation or sensibilization occurred during the heating up lag phases. the under-prediction of the number of survivors might be greater than 15  log cfu within the nonisothermal treatment conditions investigated. therefore, the nonisothermal survival curves of the most heat-resistant microorganisms were  fitted with the following equation: log s(t) = -(t/delta)p. this equation accurately described the survival curves of all the bacteria tested. we observed  a linear relationship between the log of the scale parameter (delta) and the log  of the heating rate. a p value characteristic of each microorganism and ph tested was calculated. two equations capable of predicting the inactivation rate of all  bacteria tested under nonisothermal treatments at ph 7.4, 5.5, or 4.0 were developed. the model was evaluated in skim milk and apple juice. the results of this study could be used to help minimize public health risks and to extend the shelf life of those foods requiring long heating up lag phases during processing.

TI  == am-7359--a novel oxazolidinone with low resistance potential and potent activity  against drug resistant pathogens.
AB  == am-7359 is a member of a novel series of oxazolidinones with antimicrobial activity against pathogens resistant to multiple antibiotics. potent antibiotics  with limited drug cross resistance to current therapeutic agents are needed for the treatment of drug resistant pathogens. this study investigated the resistance development to linezolid (lzd) and am-7359 by key pathogens and the degree of cross resistance between these two oxazolidinones. both am-7359 and lzd, demonstrates a low frequency of resistance development. after 30 passages and selection for resistant development of four different staphylococcus aureus and enterococus faecium strains the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for am-7359 was 1 <or= microg/ml compared to 32 to 256 microg/ml for lzd. in cross resistance studies am-7359 demonstrated mics of 0.5 to 1 microg/ml against the resistant strains selected on lzd. lzd mics against the resistant strains selected on am-7359 were 32-64 microg/ml.

TI  == structural basis for streptogramin b resistance in staphylococcus aureus by virginiamycin b lyase.
AB  == the streptogramin combination therapy of quinupristin-dalfopristin (synercid) is  used to treat infections caused by bacterial pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. however, the effectiveness of this therapy is being compromised because  of an increased incidence of streptogramin resistance. one of the clinically observed mechanisms of resistance is enzymatic inactivation of the type b streptogramins, such as quinupristin, by a streptogramin b lyase, i.e., virginiamycin b lyase (vgb). the enzyme catalyzes the linearization of the cyclic antibiotic via a cleavage that requires a divalent metal ion. here, we present crystal structures of vgb from s. aureus in its apoenzyme form and in complex with quinupristin and mg2+ at 1.65- and 2.8-a resolution, respectively. the fold  of the enzyme is that of a seven-bladed beta-propeller, although the sequence reveals no similarity to other known members of this structural family. quinupristin binds to a large depression on the surface of the enzyme, where it predominantly forms van der waals interactions. validated by site-directed mutagenesis studies, a reaction mechanism is proposed in which the initial abstraction of a proton is facilitated by a mg2+ -linked conjugated system. analysis of the vgb-quinupristin structure and comparison with the complex between quinupristin and its natural target, the 50s ribosomal subunit, reveals features that can be exploited for developing streptogramins that are impervious  to vgb-mediated resistance.

AB  == background: ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an n-phosphono prodrug. we investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. methods: mics were determined by clsi agar dilution, but with varied inocula. mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. results: mics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 0.5-2 mg/l, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/l, respectively. even with 2% nacl added, all mrsa were susceptible at 2 mg/l. mics for enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/l; e. faecium was resistant. mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., morganella morganii and proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/l versus 0.12-1 mg/l for enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter  spp. and 2-8 mg/l for acinetobacter spp. mics rose to 1-2 mg/l for many enterobacteriaceae with classical tem beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), hyperproduced ampc or k1 enzymes. mics for strains with classical tem/shv beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with esbls. resistance due to class a beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. geometric mean mics were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised mics for beta-lactamase-positive moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. ceftaroline selected ampc-derepressed enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected esbl variants of blatem in e. coli. resistance selection was not seen with s. aureus, h. influenzae or pneumococci. conclusions: ceftaroline has impressive anti-mrsa and anti-pneumococcal activity. slight lability to classical tem and shv beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible  with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by esbls. resistance selection occurred with enterobacteriaceae, not mrsa.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacterial isolates from the asia-pacific region and an in vitro evaluation of the bactericidal activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin: a sentry program report (2003-2004).
AB  == medical centres in eight countries in the asia-pacific region provided 2391 isolates for the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program during 2003-2004 to determine their susceptibility to several antimicrobial classes, including daptomycin. daptomycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were determined for 120 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, which included wild-type (wt) methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and strains with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (hetero-vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (hvisa)).  oxacillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were much less susceptible to the other tested agents compared with oxacillin-susceptible strains. vancomycin resistance was higher among enterococcus faecium (10.3%) than enterococcus faecalis (0.4%), and macrolide resistance was high both for beta-haemolytic (17.7%) and viridans group (48.7%) streptococci. daptomycin (mic for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=0.5-1mg/l) was two-fold more potent than vancomycin, with >99% susceptibility when tested against staphylococci. all tested isolates of e.  faecalis (mic(90)=2mg/l) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(90)=0.5mg/l) were  susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin mic and mbc values were slightly higher for the hvisa isolates compared with wt-mrsa, with mbc/mic ratios of only 1-2 for both groups. the mbc/mic ratio for vancomycin was often greater when tested against these strains, particularly hvisa. in contrast, teicoplanin mbc/mic ratios were significantly higher, with many of the strains showing values consistent with tolerance (>or=32). daptomycin was demonstrated to have excellent in vitro activity when tested against gram-positive isolates collected from asia-pacific countries, including hvisa strains.

TI  == in-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. it forms a stable inhibitory complex with staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). in recent studies of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, the ceftobiprole  mic(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/l). for mrsa, mic(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/l). mics for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. ceftobiprole is active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(90) = 4 mg/l), but not generally active against enterococcus faecium (mic(90) > 16 mg/l). ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. however, recent data show activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of  ceftazidime. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class a non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class c beta-lactamases. ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of ampc beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by ampc beta-lactamase. studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by mrsa, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. it was also efficacious in murine infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with mic values < or =2 mg/l. the broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of  suspected gram-negative and gram-positive infections, including those caused by mrsa.

TI  == comparative review of the carbapenems.
AB  == the carbapenems are beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with an exceptionally broad  spectrum of activity. older carbapenems, such as imipenem, were often susceptible to degradation by the enzyme dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) located in renal tubules  and required co-administration with a dhp-1 inhibitor such as cilastatin. later additions to the class such as meropenem, ertapenem and doripenem demonstrated increased stability to dhp-1 and are administered without a dhp-1 inhibitor. like all beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, carbapenems act by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (pbps). carbapenems are stable to most beta-lactamases including ampc beta-lactamases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. resistance to carbapenems  develops when bacteria acquire or develop structural changes within their pbps, when they acquire metallo-beta-lactamases that are capable of rapidly degrading carbapenems, or when changes in membrane permeability arise as a result of loss of specific outer membrane porins. carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem) possess broad-spectrum in vitro activity, which includes activity against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria; carbapenems lack activity against enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. compared with imipenem, meropenem and doripenem, the spectrum of activity of ertapenem is more limited primarily because it lacks  activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus spp. imipenem, meropenem and doripenem have in vivo half lives of approximately 1 hour, while ertapenem has a half-life of approximately 4 hours making it suitable for once-daily administration. as with other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the most important pharmacodynamic parameter predicting in vivo efficacy is the time that  the plasma drug concentration is maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (t>mic). imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem have been studied in comparative clinical trials establishing their efficacy in the treatment of a variety of infections including complicated intra-abdominal infections, skin and  skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections, meningitis (meropenem only) and febrile neutropenia. the current role for imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem in therapy remains for use in moderate to severe nosocomial and polymicrobial infections. the unique antimicrobial spectrum and pharmacokinetic properties of ertapenem make it more suited to treatment of community-acquired infections and outpatient  intravenous antimicrobial therapy than for the treatment of nosocomial infections. doripenem is a promising new carbapenem with similar properties to those of meropenem, although it appears to have more potent in vitro activity against p. aeruginosa than meropenem. clinical trials are required to establish the efficacy and safety of doripenem in moderate to severe infections, including  nosocomial infections.

AB  == background: daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide with potent activity and broad spectrum against gram-positive bacteria currently used for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacteremia, including right sided endocarditis. we evaluated the in vitro activity of this compound and selected comparator agents tested against clinical strains of staphylococci and enterococci collected in european medical centers in 2005. methods: a total of 4,640 strains from 23 medical centers located in 10 european countries, turkey and israel (sentry program platform) were tested for susceptibility by reference  broth microdilution methods according to clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines and interpretative criteria. mueller-hinton broth was supplemented to 50 mg/l ca++ for testing daptomycin. results for oxacillin (methicillin)-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were analyzed separately. results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus varied from 2.1% in sweden to 42.5% in the united kingdom (uk) and 54.7% in ireland (29.1% overall), while vancomycin resistance rates varied from 0.0% in france, sweden and switzerland to 66.7% in the uk and 71.4% in ireland among enterococcus faecium (17.9% overall). all s. aureus strains were inhibited at daptomycin mic of 1 mg/l (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and only one coagulase-negative staphylococci strain (0.1%) showed an elevated (>1 mg/l) daptomycin mic value (4 mg/l). among e. faecalis (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mg/l; 100% susceptible) the highest daptomycin mic value was 2 mg/l; while among e. faecium  (mic50/90, 2/4 mg/l; 100% susceptible) the highest mic result was 4 mg/l. conclusion: daptomycin showed excellent in vitro activity against staphylococci and enterococci collected in european medical centers in 2005 and resistance to oxacillin, vancomycin or quinupristin/dalfopristin did not compromise its activity overall against these pathogens. based on these results and those of previous publications, daptomycin appears to be an excellent therapeutic option for serious infections caused by oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci in europe.

TI  == in vitro effect of the presence of human albumin or human serum on the bactericidal activity of daptomycin against strains with the main resistance phenotypes in gram-positives.
AB  == objectives: bactericidal activity depends on antibiotic-bacteria couples, resistance phenotype and theoretically on protein binding. this work explores the influence of protein binding on the bactericidal activity of two antibiotics, daptomycin versus vancomycin, that exhibit, respectively, different c(max) (56 versus 25.5 mg/l), protein binding (91.7% versus 36.9%) and thus theoretical free-drug fractions (4.7 versus 16.1 mg/l). methods: the effect of the presence of physiological concentrations of human albumin (4 g/dl) or human serum (90%) on the bactericidal activity of daptomycin was studied against gram-positive isolates with troublesome resistance phenotypes [multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mdrsp), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate mrsa (mrsa-hvi) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium]. killing curves (final inocula of approximately 10(7) cfu/ml) were performed using daptomycin and vancomycin concentrations similar to the c(max) obtained in serum. results: daptomycin was rapidly bactericidal (> or =3 log(10) initial inocula reduction) against s. pneumoniae and s. aureus, regardless of the strain tested or the presence of albumin or human serum (that slightly delayed bactericidal activity). against vancomycin-susceptible or -resistant enterococci, daptomycin exhibited rapid bactericidal activity, delayed to 8 and 24 h, respectively, by human albumin. vancomycin exhibited much slower bactericidal activity against mdrsp and methicillin-susceptible or -resistant s. aureus, but was never bactericidal against mrsa-hvi and vancomycin-susceptible or -resistant e. faecium. conclusions: daptomycin exhibited rapid bactericidal activity against the strains of the three gram-positive species tested, regardless of resistance phenotype or  the presence of physiological concentrations of albumin.

AB  == faropenem medoxomil is a new orally administered penem antibiotic. its chiral tetrahydrofuran substituent at position c2 is responsible for its improved chemical stability and reduced cns effects, compared with imipenem. faropenem demonstrates broad-spectrum in vitro antimicrobial activity against many gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, and is resistant to hydrolysis by nearly all beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and ampc beta-lactamases. however, faropenem is not active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia. prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparative (not vs placebo) clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (abs), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and uncomplicated skin and  skin structure infections (usssis) have demonstrated that faropenem medoxomil has equivalent efficacy and safety compared with cefuroxime, clarithromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin, cefpodoxime and amoxicillin-clavulanate. the evidence  supports faropenem medoxomil as a promising new oral beta-lactam with proven efficacy and safety for the treatment of a variety of community-acquired infections. however, the us fda recently rejected faropenem for all four indications stating that the clinical trials in abs and aecb should have been performed versus a placebo. in the cap studies, the fda stated that they could not be certain of the validity of the study population actually having the disease and for usssi, the fda stated that only a single trial was not adequate evidence of efficacy for this indication.

TI  == a comparison of available and investigational antibiotics for complicated skin infections and treatment-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus.
AB  == this article compares vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecyline, dalbavancin, telavancin, ceftobiprole, oritavancin, and ramoplanin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is administered intravenously, and is the mainstay of treatment for mrsa and csssi. while not available in the u.s., teicoplanin, another glycopeptide antibiotic, can be administered intramuscularly and has simpler dosing and monitoring requirements than vancomycin. quinupristin/dalfopristin treats vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) infections but inhibits cytochrome p450 a3p4, and has only modest activity against mrsa pneumonia. daptomycin effectively treats csssi but not pneumonia caused by mrsa, and is effective against all strains of staphylococcus. linezolid, available orally and  intravenously, is approved to treat community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia,  csssi, and infections caused by mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci including infections with concurrent bacteraemia and vree tigecycline, a glycylcycline derived from minocycline, has been approved by the fda to treat csssi and complicated intraabdominal infections, and might be effective against acinetobacter baumannii; its primary side effect is digestive upset. dalbavancin, effective against mrsa and administered intravenously once weekly, possesses coverage similar to vancomycin. telavancin deploys multiple mechanisms of action  and is effective against mrsa and gram-positive bacteria resistant to vancomycin. ceftobiprole, a cephalosporin effective against mrsa, has few side effects. oritavancin demonstrates similar activity to vancomycin but possesses extended activity against vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus and enterococci. ramoplanin, a macrocyclic depsipeptide, is unstable in the bloodstream but can be taken orally to treat clostridium difficile colitis.

TI  == electrochemical detection of harmful algae and other microbial contaminants in coastal waters using hand-held biosensors.
AB  == standard methods to identify microbial contaminants in the environment are slow,  laborious, and can require specialized expertise. this study investigated electrochemical detection of microbial contaminants using commercially available, hand-held instruments. electrochemical assays were developed for a red tide dinoflagellate (karenia brevis), fecal-indicating bacteria (enterococcus spp.), markers indicative of human sources of fecal pollution (human cluster bacteroides and the esp gene of enterococcus faecium), bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli  0157:h7, salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus), and a viral pathogen (adenovirus). for k. brevis, two assay formats (rapid pcr-detect and hybrid pcr-detect) were tested and both provided detection limits of 10 genome equivalents for dna isolated from k. brevis culture and amplified by pcr.  sensitivity with coastal water samples was sufficient to detect k. brevis that was "present" (<or=1000 cells/l) without yielding false positive results and the  electrochemical signal was significantly different than for samples containing cells at "medium" concentrations (100,000 to<10(6)cells/l). detection of k. brevis rna was also shown. multi-target capability was demonstrated with an 8-plex assay for bacterial and viral targets using isolated dna, natural beach water spiked with human feces, and water and sediments collected from new orleans, louisiana following hurricane katrina. furthermore, direct detection of  dinoflagellate and bacterial dna was achieved using lysed cells rather than extracted nucleic acids, allowing streamlining of the process. the methods presented can be used to rapidly (3-5h) screen environmental water samples for the presence of microbial contaminants and have the potential to be integrated into semi-automated detection platforms.

TI  == semisynthetic approaches to laspartomycin analogues.
AB  == laspartomycin c (1), a lipopeptide antibiotic related to amphomycin, consists of  a cyclic peptide core and an aspartic acid unit external to the core and linking  this to a c15-2,3-unsaturated fatty acid. this was reported initially to be active against staphylococcus aureus, and more recent studies have shown that it  is active against vre, visa, and mrsa isolates. the enzymatic cleavage of the fatty acid tail was accomplished with a deacylase produced by actinoplanes utahensis and resulted in two peptides, designated peptide 1 and peptide 2. semisynthetic derivatives of both peptides have been made, and the principal requirement for biological activity appears to be the presence of an acylaspartic acid.

TI  == characterization of macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci from colombian hospitals: a countrywide surveillance.
AB  == objective: the characterization of macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci recovered from colombian hospitals. methods: the resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of streptococcus  pneumoniae (1679), staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci  (cons) (175), and enterococcus spp (123). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for erythromycin (ery) and clindamycin (cli), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. results: resistance to ery and cli was 3.3% and 2.3% for s. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for s. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ery resistance was 62% in enterococcus faecalis and 82% in enterococcus faecium. the mls(b)-type accounted for 71% of s. pneumoniae and 100% of mrsa. the erm(a) gene was prevalent in mrsa, erm(b) in s. pneumoniae  and enterococci, and erm(c) in cons isolates. efflux pump genes (mef(a) genes) were mostly identified in s. pneumoniae (24%). the most common genotype amongst ery-resistant pneumococci was the spain(6b)-2 clone. conclusions: the prevalence  of macrolide resistance is low in colombian pneumococci and high in mrsa (cmls(b)-type).

TI  == in vitro growth control of selected pathogens by lactobacillus acidophilus- and lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
AB  == aims: food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled ph conditions. methods and results: the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella serotype typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria innocua, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees c. in the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (lab), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. however, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. the soluble portion of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. listeria innocua and staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of  85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. this soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were l. innocua and e. coli o157:h7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kgy using a (60)co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. enterococcus faecalis, e. coli o157:h7 and staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction,  showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. conclusions: the results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in  the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of lact. acidophilus- and lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic factors influencing emergence of resistance to linezolid in an in vitro model.
AB  == emerging resistance threatens the usefulness of linezolid for the treatment of severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. optimal pharmacokinetic (pk)/pharmacodynamic (pd) indices have been described for the antimicrobial efficacy of linezolid (area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h at steady state divided by the mic, >100; the cumulative percentage of a 24-h period that the drug concentration exceeds the mic under steady-state pk conditions, >85). the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of these pk/pd indices on the development of resistance to linezolid by using an in vitro  pk/pd model. four dosage regimens were simulated over 72 h (two intermittent bolus regimens of 600 mg every 12 h [q12h] and 120 mg q12h and two continuous-infusion regimens of 120 mg/24 h and 30 mg/24 h) against four reference strains: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (hvisa), vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre). linezolid concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid  chromatography. changes in susceptibility were characterized by pre- and posttreatment mic measurements and population analysis profiles (paps). the linezolid concentrations that were achieved closely matched those that were targeted. the simulation with 600 mg q12h provided a >3-log10 reduction in the number of cfu/ml for all four strains, as did the 120-mg-q12h regimen for hvisa and visa and the 30-mg/24-h continuous infusion for vre and visa. after 72 h of exposure to the 120-mg/24-h continuous-infusion simulation, the area under the pap curve for all strains increased substantially (40 to 178%); increases in the  mics for the mrsa and hvisa strains were observed. the results demonstrate that pk/pd considerations are important in optimizing both antibacterial activity and  the development of resistance to linezolid. the potential for resistance development appears to be higher when a constant concentration is maintained in the vicinity of the mic of the bacteria.

TI  == interplay among folding, sequence, and lipophilicity in the antibacterial and hemolytic activities of alpha/beta-peptides.
AB  == host-defense peptides inhibit bacterial growth but manifest relatively little toxicity toward eukaryotic cells. many host-defense peptides adopt alpha-helical  conformations in which cationic side chains and lipophilic side chains are segregated to distinct regions of the molecular surface ("globally amphiphilic helices"). several efforts have been made to develop unnatural oligomers that mimic the selective antibacterial activity of host-defense peptides; these efforts have focused on the creation of molecules that are globally amphiphilic in the preferred conformation. one such endeavor, from our laboratories, focused  on helix-forming alpha/beta-peptides, i.e., oligomers containing a 1:1 pattern of alpha- and beta-amino acid residues in the backbone [schmitt, m. a.; weisblum, b.; gellman, s. h. j. am. chem. soc. 2004, 126, 6848-6849]. we found, unexpectedly, that the most favorable biological activity profile was displayed by a "scrambled" sequence, which was designed not to be able to form a globally amphiphilic helix. here we report new data, involving an expanded set of alpha/beta-peptides, from experiments designed to elucidate the origins of this surprising result. in addition, we evaluate the susceptibility of alpha/beta-peptides to proteolytic degradation. our results support the hypothesis that the ability to adopt a globally amphiphilic helical conformation  is not a prerequisite for selective antibacterial activity. this conclusion represents a significant advance in our understanding of the relationship among molecular composition, conformation, and biological activity. our results should  therefore influence the design of other unnatural oligomers intended to function  as antibacterial agents.

TI  == a review of the current place of glycopeptides in turkish medical practice.
AB  == background: glycopeptide antibiotics are considered by many investigators to be the last resort in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. objective: the aim of this review was to assess the place of glycopeptides in the treatment of common gram-positive bacteria in accordance with the current epidemiologic data in turkey. methods: a search of both the english- and turkish-language literature indexed on medline, ulakbim (turkey), and pleksus (turkey) was performed using the terms: vancomycin, teicoplanin, and glycopeptides, or their turkish-language counterparts. the complete texts of the  articles found in these databases were obtained from the electronic library of gulhane medical academy, ankara, turkey. articles from regional journals, without the support of an electronic format, were obtained by direct communication. articles of interest were those based on studies occurring in turkish populations, with special consideration given to publications in press after 2002. results: staphylococci were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens encountered in turkish hospitals. studies have found that approximately 74% of strains were staphylococcus aureus and the remaining strains were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). overall methicillin resistance in staphylococci was reported as approximately 60%. in turkey, s aureus was one of the most common infectious agents found inside hospitals and is deemed a growing  threat in the community. while the rate of methicillin resistance in community-acquired isolates is approximately 4%, the data from hospitals suggest  that reduced resistance comprises most of the isolates. in the studies reviewed,  older quinolones like ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin seem to be ineffective in nearly half of the s aureus isolates. alternatives like rifampicin, gentamicin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx), clindamycin, and erythromycin have had substantial resistance profiles in >50% of the strains. in  recent turkish studies, in vitro profiles of linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (qd), and daptomycin have had positive results. as in the s aureus isolates, resistance trends have been observed in the cons group of pathogens. the possible use of beta-lactams seems restricted, and alternative approaches have become necessary. quinolones, gentamicin, tetracycline, tmp/smx, clindamycin, and erythromycin have resistance profiles of >50%. although glycopeptide resistance was not detected, the frequency of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate s aureus, a precursor to future resistance, was 13% in 1 study. current studies in turkey have found that enterococcus faecalis comprises three quarters of enterococci while the rest are comprised of enterococcus faecium. initial studies performed with linezolid, qd, and daptomycin suggest that these drugs might be effective alternatives for future enterococcal infections that may have high glycopeptide resistance. approximately 8% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains had high-level resistance in turkey. however, 10 million units of crystallized penicillin or 3 g of oral amoxicillin maintains the optimum treatment of pneumococcal infections outside the central nervous system (cns). resistance profiles in third-generation cephalosporins in turkey range between 2% and 2.5%.  conclusions: in turkey, a review of the existing literature found that the current use of glycopeptides in pneumococcal infections is restricted to cns infections facing therapeutic failure in due course. however, the belief that these drugs are the last resort, either in staphylococcal or enterococcal infections, is no longer valid. if a patient has a critical status due to probable gram-positive microorganisms, clinicians should consider the empiric use of glycopeptides. however, new molecules such as linezolid, qd, and daptomycin, offered for use in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial diseases, should be reserved for the future, when glycopeptides eventually become obsolete.

AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two vira studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. methods: in february 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus  influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (365), pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and acinetobacter baumannii (92). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. susceptibility was determined with  a broth microdilution method. results: among the non-penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). among mrsa, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin mic of 4  microg/ml. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli was 12.1%. resistance of a. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). conclusion: these results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.

AB  == bacteremias in inpatient chronic hd units have been described, but there is little information on bacteremias in ambulatory hd units. to determine the frequency of bacteremia and pathogen distribution in ambulatory chronic hd units, we retrospectively reviewed our experience with 107 bacteremias in 5 chronic ambulatory hd units over a 3 year period. the object of the study was twofold. the first objective was to determine if bacteremias in ambulatory hd setting were substantially different in frequency or type than in the inpatient hd setting. secondly, febrile patients suspected of having bacteremia in chronic hd patients  are often empirically treated with vancomycin and gentamicin. chronic hd patients require repeated and frequent venous access for hd. bacteremias are common in chronic hd patients and may be primary or secondary and are often related to venous access site infections. the distributions of bacteremia pathogens in chronic hd patients are predominantly reflective of skin flora, i.e., staphylococci and to lesser extent aerobic gram-negative bacilli. after s. aureus (msra/mssa) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons), enterococci are the next most important gram-positive pathogens in bacteremic hd patients. most strains of e. faecalis are sensitive to vancomycin and for practical purposes should be considered as vancomycin sensitive enterococci (vse). in contrast, most strains of e. faecium are resistant to vancomycin and should be considered as vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre). we retrospectively reviewed 107 patients  on chronic ambulatory hd to determine the adequacy of empiric vancomycin and gentamicin prophylaxis. we found amikacin is preferred to gentamicin and that meropenem is an effective alternate substitution for gentamicin and vancomycin combination therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy of multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == antibiotic resistance among pneumococci, enterococci, and staphylococci has become increasingly important in recent decades. clinicians should be familiar with the nuances of antibiotic susceptibility testing and interpretation in selecting antibiotics for these infections. the clinical significance of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, macrolide-resistant s pneumoniae,  and multidrug-resistant s pneumoniae is discussed. the clinical spectrum and therapeutic approach to enterococcus faecalis (i.e., vancomycin-sensitive enterococci) and e faecium (i.e., vancomycin-resistant enterococci) are discussed. differences in therapeutic approach between methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) infections are reviewed. differences between in vitro susceptibility testing and in vivo effectiveness of antibiotics for hospital-acquired mrsa (ha-mrsa) are described.  finally, the clinical features of infection and therapy of ha-mrsa and community-acquired mrsa (ca-mrsa) infections are compared.

TI  == high-level vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with a  polymicrobial biofilm.
AB  == glycopeptides such as vancomycin are the treatment of choice for infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. this study describes the identification of high-level vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) isolates in a  polymicrobial biofilm within an indwelling nephrostomy tube in a patient in new york. s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, micrococcus species, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the biofilm. for vrsa isolates, vancomycin mics ranged from 32 to >128 microg/ml. vrsa isolates were also resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, penicillin, and tetracycline but remained susceptible to chloramphenicol, linezolid, rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. the vana gene was localized to a plasmid of approximately 100 kb in vrsa and e. faecium isolates from the biofilm. plasmid analysis revealed that the vrsa isolate acquired the 100-kb e. faecium plasmid, which was then maintained without integration into the mrsa plasmid. the tetracycline resistance genes tet(u) and tet(s), not previously detected in s. aureus isolates, were identified in the vrsa isolates. additional resistance elements in the vrsa isolate included a multiresistance gene cluster, ermb-aade-sat4-apha-3, msra (macrolide efflux), and the bifunctional aminoglycoside resistance gene aac(6')-aph(2")-ia. multiple combinations of resistance genes among the various isolates of staphylococci and  enterococci, including vana, tet(s), and tet(u), illustrate the dynamic nature of gene acquisition and loss within and between bacterial species throughout the course of infection. the potential for interspecies transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes, including resistance to vancomycin, may be enhanced by the microenvironment of a biofilm.

TI  == high prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. in korea: a konsar program in 2004.
AB  == a nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in korea. in this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by konsar group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. in hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. the most prevalent species was staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals,  but escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. the proportions of enterococcus faecium to all isolates of enterococcus faecalis plus e. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. the mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals  were: oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant e. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). in conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant k. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp.  and p. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae,  and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.

TI  == serum bactericidal activities of high-dose daptomycin with and without coadministration of gentamicin against isolates of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus species.
AB  == the purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers (sbts) of daptomycin alone and in combination with gentamicin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and enterococci to determine if there might be any benefit to the addition of the aminoglycoside. a multiple-dose, randomized crossover study was performed in 11 healthy volunteers to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of 6 mg/kg of body weight daptomycin once daily with or without 1 mg/kg gentamicin every 8 h. sbts were determined against  clinical isolates of nosocomial (mrsa 494) and community-acquired (ca-mrsa 44) methicillin-resistant s. aureus, vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (vsef 49452), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref 80), and quality control strains of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (atcc 29213) and vancomycin-susceptible e. faecalis (atcc 29212). enhancement of bactericidal activity was evaluated by calculating and comparing the areas under the bactericidal curve (aubc) for each dosing regimen against each isolate. the area  under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h and clearance for daptomycin alone were 645 +/- 91 microg.h/ml and 9.47 +/- 1.4 mg/h/kg, respectively, compared with 642 +/- 69 microg.h/ml and 9.45 +/- 1.0 mg/h/kg for daptomycin plus gentamicin. daptomycin alone displayed sustained bactericidal activity against five of the six isolates over the entire 24-h dosing interval; bactericidal activity was maintained for 8 h against vref 80. mean aubcs for daptomycin alone  ranged from 935 to 1,263 and 36 to 238 against staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates, respectively, compared with 902 to 972 and 34 to 213 against staphylococci and enterococci when coadministered with gentamicin. the results of this study suggest that the addition of gentamicin does not alter the pharmacokinetic profile or enhance the bactericidal activity of daptomycin against staphylococcal or enterococcal isolates.

TI  == evaluation of inhibition and cross-reaction effects on real-time pcr applied to the total dna of wastewater samples for the quantification of bacterial antibiotic resistance genes and taxon-specific targets.
AB  == in order to evaluate the applicability of six primer and probe sets for taqman real-time rcr on dna of wastewater samples, effects of the sample matrix and dna  background on target quantification were studied with respect to differences between functional genes and taxonomically used rdna targets. primer/probe assays for real-time pcr (taqman) designed to quantitatively detect the antibiotic resistance genes bla(vim), vana, ampc, meca, and taxon-specific 23s rdna sequences for pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium/faecalis were tested for their sensitivity and amplification robustness. the amplification of their gene targets in dna extracts of wastewater ("wastewater dna") and reference strains ("reference dna") was compared with their amplification in "model dna" which was composed of wastewater dna and reference dna. target detection was quantifiable along up to seven decimal orders of magnitude. for the detection of  the resistance genes bla(vim), vana, ampc, and meca as well as the enterococci directed pcr only weak or no inhibition due to the impurities or wastewater dna matrix were demonstrated for the applied target concentrations. the taxonomically applied detection system for the quantification of p. aeruginosa showed a limited performance. for the analysis of the amplification dynamics of possibly similar nucleotide sequences of organisms related to p. aeruginosa a sybr green assay was employed. competitive amplification of similar sequences was identified to be a major mechanism of reduced sensitivity. hence, the primers were modified for an optimised detection. with the resulting reduction of cross reactions an increased sensitivity was achieved for the detection and quantification of p. aeruginosa in wastewater dna.

TI  == antimicrobial disinfection effect of a laundering procedure for hospital textiles against various indicator bacteria and fungi using different substrates for simulating human excrements.
AB  == recent studies confirm the increase of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. one of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate  laundering procedures. most slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. in addition to this fact, there is an increasing number of hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. on the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. in our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering  effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium terrae, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating human excrements and were inoculated together with the  chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions.  it was found that e. faecium, s. aureus, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa survived at 60 degrees c, but no microorganisms were found at 75 degrees c.

AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the rate of nosocomial infections (nis), frequency of nosocomial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility changes in a 530-bed hospital over a five-year period. hospital-wide laboratory-based ni  surveillance was performed prospectively between 1999 and 2003. the centers for disease control and prevention's definitions were used for nis and nosocomial surgical site infections, and ni rates were calculated by the number of nis per number of hospitalized patients on an annual basis. ni rates ranged between 1.4%  and 2.4%. higher rates were observed in the neurology, neurosurgery, paediatric and dermatology departments; the low rate of nis overall may be due to the surveillance method used. the most commonly observed infections were urinary tract, surgical site and primary bloodstream infections, and the most frequently  isolated pathogens were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus aureus. carbapenems were the most effective agents against enterobacteriaceae. meticillin resistance among s. aureus isolates was less than 50%, and all s. aureus and enterococcus spp. isolates were susceptible  to glycopeptides apart from one glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium isolate identified in 2003. data obtained by the same method enabled comparison between years and assisted in the detection of recent changes. antimicrobial susceptibility data on nosocomial pathogens provided valuable guidance for empirical antimicrobial therapy of nis.

TI  == intracellular accumulation of linezolid in escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes: role of enhanced efflux pump activity and inactivation.
AB  == objectives: the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics such as linezolid have a narrow spectrum of activity that targets gram-positive bacteria. we hypothesized  that the poor activity of linezolid in gram-negative bacteria is in part caused by relatively low intracellular concentration due to efflux. methods: using whole cell accumulation assays we estimated the intracellular concentration of linezolid in escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae. we included test strains with enhanced rnd-type multidrug efflux pump activity and with genetic inactivation of the pump or functional inhibition by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone as inhibitor of the proton motive force or 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (nmp), an efflux pump inhibitor. results: consistent with susceptibility studies, enhanced pump activity caused decreased accumulation, and pump inactivation and inhibition caused increased accumulation, of linezolid. the accumulation levels in test strains of e. coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter aerogenes with functional pumps were lower than in control strains of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium, but were higher after pump inactivation and correlated with ethidium bromide and pyronin y accumulation. conclusions: the intracellular concentration of linezolid is comparatively low owing to efficient efflux of the drug and could be increased substantially by inhibition of rnd-type efflux pumps.

TI  == purification and characterization of two bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from mongolian airag.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to isolate and identify bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) issued from mongolian airag (traditional fermented mare's milk), and to purify and characterize bacteriocins produced by these lab.  methods and results: identification of the bacteria (enterococcus durans) was carried out on the basis of its morphological, biochemical characteristics and carbohydrate fermentation profile and by api50ch kit and 16s rdna analyses. the ph-neutral cell-free supernatant of this bacterium inhibited the growth of several lactobacillus spp. and food-borne pathogens including escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and listeria innocua. the antimicrobial agent (enterocin a5-11) was heat stable and was not sensitive to acid and alkaline conditions (ph  2-10), but was sensitive to several proteolytic enzymes. its inhibitory activity  was completely eliminated after treatment with proteinase k and alpha-chymotrypsin. the activity was however not completely inactivated by other  proteases including trypsin and pepsin. three-step purification procedure with high recovery yields was developed to separate two bacteriocins. the applied procedure allowed the recovery of 16% and 64% of enterocins a5-11a and a5-11b, respectively, present in the culture supernatant with purity higher than 99%. sds-page analyses revealed that enterocin a5-11 has a molecular mass of 5000 da and mass spectrometry analyses demonstrates molecular masses of 5206 and 5218 da  for fractions a and b, respectively. amino acid analyses of both enterocins indicated significant quantitative difference in their contents in threonine, alanine, isoleucine and leucine. their n-termini were blocked hampering straightforward edman degradation. conclusions: bacteriocins a5-11a and b from ent. durans belong to the class ii of bacteriocins. significance and impact of the study: judging from molecular masses, amino acid composition and spectrum of  activities, bacteriocins a5-11a and b from ent. durans show high degree of similarity with enterocins l50a and l50b isolated from enterococcus faecium (cintas et al. 1998, 2000) and with enterocin i produced by ent. faecium 6t1a, a  strain originally isolated from a spanish-style green olive fermentation (floriano et al. 1998).

TI  == antibiotic resistance in the southeastern mediterranean--preliminary results from the armed project.
AB  == sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to  be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been  lacking in the past. susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in algeria, cyprus, egypt, jordan, lebanon, malta, morocco, tunisia and turkey were collected as part of the armed project. preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in s. pneumoniae to range from 0% (malta) to 36% (algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in lebanon to 65% in jordan [median: 43%]. significant country specific resistance in e. coli was also seen,  with 72% of isolates from egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in turkey.  vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of e. faecalis isolates from turkey and in 3.8% of e. faecium isolates from cyprus. the preliminary results from the armed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the mediterranean region. they suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern mediterranean region where resistance in s. aureus and e. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the  other countries of the mediterranean.

TI  == assessment of two commercial susceptibility test methods for determination of daptomycin mics.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against several important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. because the mechanism of action of daptomycin is calcium-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane, susceptibility testing requires medium supplemented with a physiological level of calcium. this study assessed two food  and drug administration-cleared commercial test devices for determination of daptomycin mics, etest and justone. a collection of 220 selected isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum, were tested by both methods. included in the collection were 22 s. aureus and 14  enterococcus sp. isolates that were recovered from patients and were nonsusceptible on the basis of the daptomycin mics. as the reference method for comparison, all isolates were tested by the clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution method incorporating cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth with 50 microg/ml calcium. daptomycin mics agreed, within 1 twofold dilution, for 97% of the isolates by etest and for 100% by justone. however, daptomycin mics determined by etest were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 65% of the enterococcus sp. isolates tested. this resulted in 28.5% very major (vm) errors (4/14) with enterococci (all e. faecium) but none (0/22) with staphylococci. use of justone yielded mics that were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 69% of the staphylococci and 25% of the enterococci. this resulted in 13.6% vm errors (3/22) with staphylococci and 14.3% vm errors (2/14)  with enterococci. the manufacturer-recommended justone inoculum preparation resulted in mean colony counts of only 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml in the wells of the strip. increasing the inoculum to 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) cfu/ml eliminated two of five vm errors upon retesting. no major interpretive errors occurred with  either device. in summary, daptomycin mics generated by the etest or justone method generally agreed within 1 dilution of the reference daptomycin mics. however, both devices produced slightly lower mics that resulted in some vm errors.

AB  == the antibiotic resistance surveillance project ar-iss, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country.  the laboratories collect and transmit data to the istituto superiore di sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis/faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed escherichia coli. they also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study earss-italia and from other european countries. oxacillin resistance in s. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in europe (41,5%). no strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. in s. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several european countries. unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in e. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in europe. presumptive esbl production in gram-negative organisms can be  estimated at 20% in klebsiella and 1% in e. coli. ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in europe. in conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. although some activities of ar-iss  need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and  representative data about antibiotic resistance in italy that can be used for comparison at the european level.

TI  == inactivation of influenza a virus by gentian violet (gv) and gv-dyed cotton cloth, and bactericidal activities of these agents.
AB  == recently we have heard warnings of an outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (h5n1). although, to prevent such infections we must prepare anti-viral drugs and type-specific vaccines against influenza, we need various simple and effective protection methods, such as the use of face masks for public health. also, in any consideration of bacterial infections, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) also pose serious concerns which must be addressed. i examined the antiviral activity of gentian violet (gv) and gv-dyed cloth against the influenza a (h1n1) virus. time-kill studies were carried out, and the virus titer was determined based on the 50% tissue culture infective dose (tcid50). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of gv against bacteria were also determined, and the killing activities of the gv-dyed  cloth were judged from viable cell counts. gv immediately killed the influenza a  virus and this was confirmed by electron microscopy. moreover, cloth dyed with a  combination of gv and copper showed not only excellent antiviral activity but also prominent bactericidal activities.

TI  == the effect of temperature on the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs.
AB  == purpose: to determine the survival of different bacteria inoculated in optisol-gs at refrigerated storage temperature (6 degrees c) and after subsequent warming to room temperature (19-22 degrees c). methods: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus  faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were chosen from stock clinical isolates for inclusion in the study. the first group consisted of  12 optisol-gs vials. the second group consisted of 12 optisol-gs vials containing corneas inappropriate for transplantation according to the eye bank association of america (ebaa) protocols. each group was inoculated with 3 concentrations of approximately 10, 10, and 10 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of each bacterial species and then refrigerated per ebaa protocol. after 48 hours of refrigeration, all vials were placed at room temperature (rt) and counts were performed at 48, 50 (2 hour rt), 54 (6 hour rt), 60 (12 hour rt), 72 (24 hour rt), and 96 (48 hour rt) hours. at 96 hours, the corneal tissue from 10 and 10 inocula were cultured.  all samples underwent serial dilution, spiral plating on blood agar plates, and incubation at 35 degrees c. viable colony counts were determined at 24 hours. results: except for the 10 cfu/ml inocula of p. aeruginosa, all isolates were viable after 48 hours of refrigeration. rapid bactericidal activity was observed  against p. aeruginosa after 2 hours at rt, with complete sterilization by 6 hours. the rate and extent of killing against s. aureus were influenced by the initial inoculum. bactericidal activity was achieved after 2 hours at rt with 10  cfu/ml of s. aureus versus 24 hours with the 10 inoculum. of note, bactericidal activity was not observed against s. pneumoniae and e. faecium following 24 hours of storage at rt. the presence of corneal tissue did not affect viable counts, with counts from corneal tissue cultures reflecting the counts seen from optisol-gs after 48 hours at rt. conclusions: the antimicrobial activity of optisol-gs was reduced at refrigerated temperature and enhanced at rt. bactericidal activity was not observed against e. faecium at either refrigerated  temperature or rt.

TI  == predominance of gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  == background and purpose: while nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of  empirical therapy. this study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (nbsis)  surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. methods: during the period from 1996 to 2003 at national cheng kung university hospital, patients with nbsis were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. results: from 1996 to 2003, there were  4,038 episodes of nbsis. the overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. aerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of nbsis, respectively. the 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of nbsis), staphylococcus aureus (13%), candida spp. (10%), acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and escherichia coli (8%). oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of s. aureus isolates. in contrast to enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. the emerging antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant a. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli. despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. conclusions: in summary, gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing nbsis and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. surveillance of the characteristics of nbsis and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin alone and in combination with various antimicrobials against gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the increasing prevalence of resistant gram-positive cocci requires the need to search for more effective agents and synergistic combinations. forty-two vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), 30 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and 36 staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) strains were studied. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined and synergy testing was performed by using e test for daptomycin, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate against staphylococci; for daptomycin, ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin against enterococci. daptomycin in combination with ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin  was tested against enterococci; daptomycin in combination with ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ticarcillin-clavulanate was tested against staphylococci. interaction categories were defined by the fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) index. all strains of staphylococci and enterococci were susceptible to daptomycin. all three combinations showed synergy against more than 70% of the mrsa strains. daptomycin in combination with ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin against enterococci showed synergies of 64.2%, 57.1% and 21.4%, respectively. this study indicates that daptomycin alone  and combined with beta-lactams seems to be effective against mrsa, but further in vitro and in vivo studies on the subject are required before clinical use can be  recommended.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, lbm415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of lbm415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (pdfi) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (ussti), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. methods: a total of  21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons); resistance to penicillin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) among 18.0% of streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of haemophilus influenzae. results: lbm415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus faecium and moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/l; 97.0% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of h. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. seventy-seven percent of burkholderia  cepacia and 82.0% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/l. no differences in lbm415 activity against s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and h. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. while regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to lbm415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. one isolate of s. aureus displayed high-level resistance to lbm415 owing to multiple  sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defb and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. this isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. conclusions: with few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first pdfi class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. these compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. given the detection of a pre-existing pdfi-resistant isolate of s. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the pdfi-targeted  pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will  be an important component of future studies.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in enterococcus isolates from batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  == this study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as enterococcus durans. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling  and pfge were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. species recognition by means of rapd-pcr was in agreement with  the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. one strain was characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by rapd-pcr and four strains were grouped with the enterococcus faecium reference strain. all strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority  of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. all strains exhibited  antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited enterococcus faecalis. isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. however, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk  for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.

AB  == monitoring temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance can provide useful information for the empirical selection of antimicrobial agents to treat infected patients and for the control of nosocomial infections. in this study, we analyzed antimicrobial resistance of clinically relevant bacteria in 2003 at korean hospitals and at a commercial laboratory. the following organism-antimicrobial agent resistance combinations were very prevalent: oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (68%), expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), and fluoroquinolone-resistant escherichia coli (33%), acinetobacter spp. (58%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (40%). moreover, gradual increases in vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (20%), cefoxitin-resistant e. coli (10%) and k. pneumoniae (23%), and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (20%) and acinetobacter spp. (13%) were also observed. the resistance rates of acinetobacter spp. to most antimicrobial agents at hospitals and at the commercial laboratory were similar. among the acinetobacter spp. isolated at a tertiary-care hospital, 46.2% were multidrug-resistant to 9-12 of 13 antimicrobial agents, and 18.3% were panresistant. the exclusion of duplicate isolates at a tertiary-care hospital significantly lowered the proportion of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli.

TI  == beta-nitrostyrene derivatives as potential antibacterial agents: a structure-property-activity relationship study.
AB  == a multidisciplinary project was developed, combining the synthesis of a series of beta-nitrostyrene derivatives and the determination of their physicochemical parameters (redox potentials, partition coefficients), to the evaluation of the corresponding antibacterial activity. a complete conformational analysis was also performed, in order to get relevant structural information. subsequently, a structure-property-activity (spar) approach was applied, through linear regression analysis, aiming at obtaining a putative correlation between the physicochemical parameters of the compounds investigated and their antibacterial  activity (both against standard strains and clinical isolates). the beta-nitrostyrene compounds displayed a lower activity towards all the tested bacteria relative to the beta-methyl-beta-nitrostyrene analogues. this was observed particularly for the 3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-beta-methyl-beta-nitrostyrene (ivb) against the gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium). the spar results revealed the existence of a  clear correlation between the redox potentials and the antibacterial activity of  the series of beta-nitrostyrene derivatives under study.

AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of xrp2868, a new oral streptogramin composed of a combination of rpr132552 (streptogramin a) and rpr202868 (streptogramin b), was evaluated against a collection of clinical gram-positive isolates with characterized phenotypes and genotypes of streptogramin resistance. the effects of genes for resistance to streptogramin a or b on the activity of xrp2868 and its components were also tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in gram-positive recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. the species tested included staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and other species of streptococci. xrp2868 was generally fourfold more potent than quinupristin-dalfopristin against s. aureus,  e. faecium, and streptococci and had activity against e. faecalis (mics = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml). xrp2868 appeared to be affected by the same mechanisms of resistance as those to quinupristin-dalfopristin. nevertheless, the strong activity of factor a of the oral streptogramin enabled the combination to be very potent against streptogramin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and e. faecium (mics = 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml) and to retain low mics against the strains harboring a mechanism of resistance to factor a or factor b of the streptogramin. however, the combination of mechanisms of resistance to factors a  and b caused an increase in the mics of xrp2868, which reached 1 to 4 mug/ml. as  with the other streptogramins, there was a reduction in the bactericidal effect of xrpr2868 when the staphylococcal strains acquired a constitutively expressed erm gene.

TI  == a re-emerging class of antimicrobial agents: streptogramins (quinupristin/dalfopristin) in the management of multiresistant gram-positive nosocomial cocci in hospital setting.
AB  == multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, are emerging pathogens in the setting of immunocompromised, hospitalized patients, especially when surgery or invasive procedures are of concern, and patients are admitted in intensive care units. the spectrum of antimicrobial compounds available for an effective treatment of these infection is significantly threatened by the emerging and spread of glycopeptide-resistant strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a novel streptogramine association, which represents an effective response to most of these problems, due to its innovative mechanim of action, its maintained activity against multiresistant pathogens, and its possibility of synergistic activity with other compounds. problems related to the epidemiology of multiresistant gram-positive infection, potential clinical indications of quinupristin/dalfopristin, and updated data on efficacy and tolerability of this compound and its derivatives, are outlined on the ground of  a review of available literature evidences.

AB  == this study evaluated the in vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other comparators against 861 bacterial isolates recovered from patients treated in three major teaching hospitals in 2003. mics to antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. high rates of oxacillin resistance (58%) in staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), and vancomycin resistance (21%) and quinupristin-dalfopristin non-susceptibility (39%) in enterococcus faecium (34 isolates) were found. carbapenems had excellent in vitro activities (>or=98% susceptibility) against the 419 isolates of enterobacteriaceae, with the mic(50) and mic(90) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem being 0.25 and 4 mg/l, 0.03 and 0.12 mg/l, and 0.03 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively. for, pseudomonas aeruginosa (74 isolates) and burkholderia cepacia  (21 isolates), meropenem (mic(90), 0.25, 2, and 4 mg/l, respectively) had better  in vitro activities than imipenem (mic(90), 8, 4, and 32 mg/l, respectively) and  ertapenem (mic(90), 0.5, >32, and 32 mg/l, respectively). isepamicin had a similar activity with amikacin against all enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, b. cepacia, and acinetobacter baumannii, except for c. freundii isolates in which isepamicin had an eight-fold activity better than amikacin. tigecycline had excellent in vitro activities against all isolates tested (mic(90), <or=1 mg/l) including 14 pandrugresistant a. baumannii isolates (mics,  1-4 mg/l), except for proteus mirabilis (59 isolates; mic(90), 8 mg/l), bacteroides fragilis (60 isolates; mic(90), 8 mg/l), p. aeruginosa (mic(90), 16 mg/l), and b. cepacia (21 isolates; mic(90), 16 mg/l). tigecycline, carbapenems,  and isepamicin exhibited better or comparable in vitro activities against a wide  spectrum of commonly encountered bacteria than other comparator antimicrobials and may represent therapeutic options for infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == trends in antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens and effect on treatment.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens is a growing concern for health care and for public health. a recent shift in the epidemiological profile of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus has resulted not only in health care-associated infections but now, also, in community-associated infections. reports have described s. aureus exhibiting decreased susceptibility  and, even, resistance to vancomycin. the rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci may be leveling; however, vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium has already achieved high levels. multidrug resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa is increasing, and carbapenem-resistant klebsiella strains are emerging. acinetobacter species cause a minority of health care-associated pneumonias due to gram-negative organisms, but a growing proportion is resistant  to carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins. recent increases in the frequency and severity of clostridium difficile-associated illness are associated with the emergence of a hypervirulent c. difficile strain with increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones. the presence of these and other resistant organisms in health care facilities limits the number of effective antimicrobials available for treatment.

TI  == daptomycin in vitro activity tested against gram-positive strains collected from  european and latin american medical centers in 2003.
AB  == daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide, was susceptibility tested against clinical bacterial isolates consecutively collected in hospitals located in europe (4,731  strains) and latin america (1,007 strains) in 2003 as part of a continuing surveillance program. the bacterial isolates tested were gram-positive pathogens  that included staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci. the isolates were tested for susceptibility using broth microdilution methods (broth with 50 mg/l ca++ for testing daptomycin). all isolates, except two enterococcus faecium strains from europe, were inhibited at daptomycin mic of < or = 4 mg/l. in addition, 99.4 and 97.3% of isolates were inhibited at daptomycin mic of < or = 2 and < or = 1 mg/l, respectively. except for one staphylococcus aureus and one viridans group streptococci from europe and one coagulase-negative staphylococci  from latin america, all staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were inhibited  by 1 mg/l of daptomycin. resistance to other compounds (vancomycin, oxacillin, and penicillin) did not influence daptomycin activity. the activity of daptomycin was very similar in both geographic regions evaluated and demonstrated the same mic distribution as isolates evaluated in studies in the united states. the results of this study showed that daptomycin continues to be very active against  clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci isolated in europe and latin america.

TI  == vancomycin resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the first vancomycin-resistant clinical isolates of enterococcus species were reported in europe in 1988. similar strains were later detected in hospitals on the east coast of the united states. since then, vancomycin-resistant enterococci have spread with unexpected rapidity and are now encountered in hospitals in most countries. this article reviews the mode of action and the mechanism of bacterial resistance to glycopeptides, as exemplified by the vana type, which is mediated by transposon tn1546 and is widely spread in enterococci. the diversity, regulation, evolution, and recent dissemination of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus are then discussed.

TI  == microbiological features of vancomycin in the 21st century: minimum inhibitory concentration creep, bactericidal/static activity, and applied breakpoints to predict clinical outcomes or detect resistant strains.
AB  == the results of vancomycin susceptibility tests document that the drug continues to have activity against a wide variety of gram-positive pathogens. the subsequent emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, the persistent failure  of vancomycin therapy against strains tested as susceptible, and the more recent  discoveries of vancomycin-intermediate or -resistant staphylococcus aureus strains have compromised the use of vancomycin. although analyses of surveillance studies fail to demonstrate "minimum inhibitory concentration creep" among populations of wild-type enterococci, streptococci, or staphylococci, enterococci with acquired resistance to vancomycin continue to evolve. the dominantly used automated commercial tests poorly recognize vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus, heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant s. aureus isolates, which necessitates the use of expensive supplemental screening tests. monitoring for appropriate serum levels of vancomycin and determinations of the bactericidal activity of vancomycin appear to best predict clinical outcome, thus creating additional diagnostic burdens for clinical laboratories. improvements in current test methods with breakpoint criteria and expanded use of the vancomycin bactericidal assays to detect "tolerant" strains will be required  to increase the value of vancomycin treatment or to refocus therapy toward the use of newer, alternative agents.

TI  == antimicrobial agents for treatment of serious infections caused by resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococci.
AB  == as clinicians increasingly contend with infections due to staphylococci or enterococci resistant to, or failing treatment with, traditional antimicrobial agents, understanding the potential roles of older as well as more recently introduced antimicrobial agents becomes important. older agents, such as clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, have been used to treat infections due to community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. among the  licensed agents, quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline are active in vitro against most strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, but these agents differ in their approved clinical indications. new agents currently under  investigation may further expand treatment options.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem (s-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  == the spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to  be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; mic90s 0.06 mg/l), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of enterococcus faecium,  doripenem displayed modest activity (mic50 4). doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; mic(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). for enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (mic90s 0.03-0.5 mg/l). mic90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155  isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. doripenem was also active against citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp. and serratia spp. (mic90s 0.06-0.25 mg/l), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/l, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; mic50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/l, respectively). doripenem was slightly more potent (mic50 2 mg/l) than ertapenem and imipenem (mic50 4 mg/l), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (mic50 2 mg/l), against burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). both haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and moraxella catarrhalis  (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (mic90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/l, respectively). doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the leader 2004 surveillance program.
AB  == since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has  been gained. however, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the united states has  not been reported. the leader 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns), 428 enterococcus faecalis, 196 enterococcus faecium, and 422 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. all s. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (mic90 = 2 microg/ml); mic distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. for cns, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered  (staphylococcus epidermidis; mic = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the mic(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with s. aureus. for e. faecalis and e. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. both species had an mic90 of 2 microg/ml, and mic distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the s. pneumoniae isolates. these findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed  so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.

TI  == correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  == bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. this differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure  of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. the objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. a literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (icus): staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, acetinobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. to determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in icus, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. all clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory dna fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. a diversity index for each species was calculated as the number  of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. the correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. they showed median survival times between 1.5 days (p. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (enterococcus faecium). during the prospective icu study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (e. coli) were found. a correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, p=0.024). environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in icus. infection control measures should consider this finding.

TI  == dutch guideline for preventing nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms (hrmo).
AB  == hospitals are faced with the increasingly rapid emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. us and european guidelines on the prevention of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals were, until recently, mainly  directed at methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in 2004, the dutch working party on infection prevention issued a guideline on the prevention  of nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms (hrmo), in order to fulfill the growing need for additional guidance on the control of other pathogens with acquired resistance and the potential to spread within hospitals (such as glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecium, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, extendedspectrum beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae, and other (multi)drug-resistant gram-negatives). in addition  to providing criteria for defining hrmo, the dutch guideline provides recommendations on isolation of patients, active surveillance, and contact tracing. the guideline will enable the comparison of hrmo rates between hospitals, and may be used to evaluate the efficacy of programs to control antibiotic use and/or nosocomial transmission of resistant pathogens. the eventual success of nationwide implementation of this guideline remains to be established in the coming years.

TI  == bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

TI  == detection of a novel aph(2") allele (aph[2"]-ie) conferring high-level gentamicin resistance and a spectinomycin resistance gene ant(9)-ia (aad 9) in clinical isolates of enterococci.
AB  == aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (ames) are major factors that confer aminoglycoside resistance to enterococci. in an epidemiologic study on distribution of 12 ame genes in 534 recent clinical strains isolated from a japanese hospital, two uncommon ame genes, ant(9)-ia and a novel aph(2") allele,  aph(2")-ie, were detected. ant(9)-ia had been reported only in staphylococcus aureus and encodes spectinomycin adenylyltransferase ant(9)-i, which confers resistance to spectinomycin. the ant(9)-ia gene was detected in three strains, a  single strain each of enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. avium. nucleotide sequences of ant(9)-ia from these three enterococcal species were identical to that reported for s. aureus and considered to be located on tn 554. the new aph(2") allele, designated aph(2")-ie, was identified in three e. faecium strains. the aph(2")-ie allele was genetically close to aph(2")-id reported in e. casseliflavus (93.7% amino acid sequence identity; 96.3% similarity), while distant from aph(2")-ia, aph(2")-ib, or aph(2")-ic (26.3-29.5% amino acid sequence identity). sequence divergence between aph(2")-id and aph(2")-ie was mostly located in amino-terminal half. in contrast, sequences corresponding to the three motifs required for aminoglycoside phosphotransferase were conserved except for a single amino acid. three e. faecium strains having aph(2")-ie showed high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, but not to kanamycin, dibekacin, and tobramycin, unlike enzyme specificity described for aph(2")-id in  e. casseliflavus. such a difference in resistance phenotype was suggested to be related to amino acid sequence divergence between aph(2")-id and aph(2")-ie.

TI  == linezolid: a pharmacoeconomic review of its use in serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid (zyvox), the first available oxazolidinone antibacterial agent, has good activity against gram-positive pathogens, including multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. randomised multicentre trials in patients with various types of serious gram-positive infections showed that clinical cure rates with linezolid were similar to those with vancomycin or teicoplanin. in some subgroup analyses, which must be interpreted with a degree of caution, clinical advantages were noted for linezolid (e.g. versus vancomycin  in confirmed mrsa nosocomial pneumonia and mrsa-complicated skin and soft tissue  infections). although generally well tolerated, gastrointestinal adverse effects  are relatively common with linezolid and it has been associated with thrombocytopenia and myelosuppression. the oral bioavailability of linezolid is approximately 100%, thus allowing sequential intravenous-to-oral administration without changing the drug or dosage regimen. healthcare resource use data from various countries indicate that this practical advantage translates into at least a trend towards reduced length of hospital stay compared with vancomycin, which may offset its several-fold higher acquisition cost. modelled analyses from the us, despite some limitations, indicate that, compared with vancomycin, linezolid  is associated with lower total hospitalisation costs for the treatment of patients with cellulitis and has a favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately us30,000 dollars per qaly gained (2001 value) for patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. broadly similar results have also been reported in modelled analyses from other countries. in conclusion, for patients with serious gram-positive infections, including those caused by suspected or proven multidrug-resistant pathogens such as mrsa, linezolid is an effective and  generally well tolerated therapeutic option. linezolid is currently the only antibacterial agent with good activity against mrsa that can be administered orally (as well as intravenously). it may be particularly useful as an alternative to vancomycin in patients who have impaired renal function, poor or no intravenous access, require outpatient therapy, or who have been unable to tolerate glycopeptides. healthcare resource use studies and pharmacoeconomic analyses generally support the use of linezolid in some subgroups of patients, although results should be interpreted with due consideration of the study limitations.

AB  == the mode of action of dipropofol and its antibacterial activity in combination with other antibiotics against gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated. dipropofol showed a bactericidal effect against staphylococcus aureus 209p, and inhibited the incorporations of 3h-glutamate and 3h-leucine into s. aureus 209p and bacillus subtilis pci219 cells. these results indicated that the mechanism of action of dipropofol was mediated by the inhibition of protein synthesis or amino acid incorporation. a synergistic effect was performed by checkerboard titration with muller-hinton agar plates containing dipropofol (0.39 microg/ml, 1/4 x mic) and various concentrations of nine other antibiotics in vitro. the synergism against vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium was confirmed in the combination of dipropofol with rifampicin. the mic of rifampicin was decreased from 0.39 microg/ml to <0.005 microg/ml by the addition of dipropofol. this combinational effect in reversing vancomycin resistance of enterococci highlights novel drug targets and has importance in the design of new therapeutic regimens against resistant pathogens.

AB  == temporin a (ta), a short alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin of the frog rana temporaria, is effective against a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium strains. ta interacts directly with the cell membrane of the microorganism and it has been reported to be non-toxic to erythrocytes at concentrations that are antimicrobial. less is known about the effects on the viability and growth of nucleated eukaryotic cells. in this study  we have tested antibacterial and growth-inhibitory properties of ta, its dimeric  analogue (tad), and all-l (tal l512) and all-d (tad l512) enantiomeric derivatives of modified ta towards s. aureus and cultured human keratinocytes, respectively. all molecules were antibacterial at concentrations from 1.5 microm  to 10 microm. in keratinocyte cultures, tad l512, as well as tad, showed cytotoxicity. the original ta and tal l512 did not affect the viability of the cells at their bacteriolytic concentrations. the growth of keratinocytes in low-  and high-calcium media was only slightly inhibited by temporins at concentrations which were antibacterial to s. aureus. this suggests that original ta and its modification, tal l512, are promising molecules against multiresistant bacterial  infections.

AB  == although automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems are both rapid and sensitive, false-positive and false-negative results still occur. the objective of this study, then, was to evaluate negative results occurring with bact/alert 3d blood culture systems. a total of 1032 samples were cultured with the bact/alert 3d automated blood culture system, using both aerobic (fa) and anaerobic (fn) [corrected] media, and 128 of these samples yielded positive results. a total of 904 negative blood samples were then subcultured in 5% sheep  blood agar, eosin methylene blue, chocolate agar, and sabouraud-dextrose agar. organisms growing on these subcultures were subsequently identified using both vitek32 (biomerieux, durham, nc) and conventional methods. twenty four (2.6%) of  the 904 subcultures grew on the subculture media. the majority (83.3%) of these were determined to be gram-positive microorganisms. fourteen (58.3%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci, two (8.3%) were bacillus spp., one (4.2%) was staphylococcus aureus, and one (4.2%) was identified as enterococcus faecium. streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria spp. were isolated together in two (8.3%)  vials. gram-negative microorganisms comprised 12.5% of the subcultures, of which  two (8.3%) were found to be pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one (4.2%) was pseudomonas fluorescens. the other isolate (4.2%) was identified as candida albicans. we conclude that the subculture of negative results is valuable in the  bact/alert 3d system, especially in situations in which only one set of blood cultures is taken.

TI  == the streptogramin antibiotics: update on their mechanism of action.
AB  == antibiotics of the streptogramin class are an association of two types of chemically different compounds, group a molecules and group b molecules, acting in synergy. the combination of these molecules generally inhibits bacterial growth at a lower concentration than does either the group a or group b molecule  alone and is often bactericidal against strains of bacteria for which each type of molecule alone is only bacteriostatic. the semisynthetic streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500), the first water-soluble member of this class, is under development for the treatment of severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus faecium, and other organisms. the streptogramins block the translation of mrna into protein. both group a and group b molecules bind to the peptidyl-transferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. the group b molecule stimulates the dissociation of peptidyl-trna from the ribosome and may interfere with the passage of the completed polypeptide away from the peptidyl-transferase centre. the group a molecule inhibits the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing both the binding of aminoacyl-trna to the ribosomal a site and the formation of the peptide bond. when the two types of molecule are used in combination, the binding of the group  a molecule alters the conformation of the ribosome such that the affinity of the  ribosome for the b molecule is increased. this accounts, in part or entirely, for the observed synergy. this synergy is unaffected by ribosomal modifications conferring resistance to the macrolides, lincosamides, and group b molecules alone.

AB  == a rapid increase of nosocomial methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infection (from 39% in 1991 to 75% in 2003) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci  (vre) (from 1.2% in 1996 to 6.1% in 2003) at a university hospital in taiwan was  found. the noticeable rise of mrsa and vre was significantly correlated with the  increased consumption of glycopeptides, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones  (pearson's correlation coefficient, p < 0.05). minimum inhibitory concentrations  (mics) of 100 non-duplicate blood isolates of mrsa (in 2003) and of 25 non-duplicate isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and 172 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (in 1996-2003) causing nosocomial infection recovered from various clinical specimens of patients treated at the hospital to nine antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. all of these isolates were susceptible to linezolid and were inhibited by 0.5mg/l of tigecycline, and all mrsa isolates were inhibited by daptomycin 1mg/l, including two isolates of mrsa with heteroresistance to vancomycin. daptomycin had two-fold better activity against vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis (mic90, 2 mg/l) than against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (mic90, 4 mg/l). decreased susceptibilities of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and mrsa to quinupristin/dalfopristin (non-susceptibility 25% and 8%, respectively) were found. telithromycin had poor activity against the isolates tested (mic90, 8 mg/l). linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline may represent therapeutic options for infections caused by these resistant gram-positive organisms.

TI  == global spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium from distinct nosocomial genetic complex.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have caused hospital outbreaks worldwide,  and the vancomycin-resistance gene (vana) has crossed genus boundaries to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. spread of vre, therefore, represents an immediate threat for patient care and creates a reservoir of mobile resistance genes for other, more virulent pathogens. evolutionary genetics, population structure, and geographic distribution of 411 vre and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium isolates, recovered from human and nonhuman sources and community and hospital reservoirs in 5 continents, identified a genetic lineage of e. faecium (complex-17) that has spread globally. this lineage is characterized by 1) ampicillin resistance, 2) a pathogenicity island, and 3) an association with hospital outbreaks. complex-17 is an example of cumulative evolutionary processes that improved the relative fitness of bacteria in hospital environments. preventing further spread of this epidemic e. faecium subpopulation is critical, and efforts should focus on the early disclosure of ampicillin-resistant complex-17 strains.

AB  == bloodstream infection (bsi) is a significant problem after cord blood transplantation (cbt). however, little information has been reported on bsi after reduced-intensity cbt (ri-cbt). we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 102 patients. the median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 17-79 years). preparative regimens comprised fludarabine 125 to 150 mg/m 2 , melphalan  80 to 140 mg/m 2 , or busulfan 8 mg/kg and total body irradiation 2 to 8 gy. prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease comprised cyclosporin or tacrolimus. bsi developed within 100 days of ri-cbt in 32 patients. the cumulative incidence of bsi was 25% at day 30 and 32% at day 100. the median onset was day 15 (range, 1-98 days). causative organisms included pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 11), staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), enterococcus faecium (n = 4), enterococcus faecalis (n = 4), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 4), and others (n = 7). of the 32 patients with bsi, 25 (84%) died within 100 days after ri-cbt. bsi was the direct cause of death in 8 patients (25%). univariate analysis failed to identify any significant risk factors. bsi clearly represents a significant and fatal complication after ri-cbt. further studies are warranted to determine clinical characteristics, identify patients at high risk of bsi, and establish therapeutic strategies.

TI  == the need for new therapeutic agents: what is the pipeline?
AB  == there is a clinical need for new treatment options for serious gram-positive infections. recently introduced agents such as the newer fluoroquinolones and the ketolide telithromycin have limited use as they do not cover methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) or glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre). the clinical use of the streptogramin combination quinupristin/dalfopristin, which has activity against mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, is limited because administration is via a slow infusion of a large volume. the oxazolidinone linezolid is active against mrsa and gre but resistant organisms and treatment failures have been reported. a number of compounds currently in development show promise, the new glycopeptides oritavancin, dalbavancin and the glycolipodepsipeptide ramoplanin,  as well as the new tetracyclines tigecycline and bay73-7388. however, in some cases, there is concern that resistance may develop quickly to new compounds that are based on existing antimicrobial agents. therefore daptomycin, a novel lipopeptide with a unique mode of action, is of particular interest. daptomycin is active against mrsa (including vancomycin-resistant strains) and gre. daptomycin displays rapid concentration-dependent killing and is bactericidal even in the stationary phase of growth. daptomycin-resistant strains are very difficult to generate in vitro. a dosage of 4 mg/kg intravenous once a day has been shown to be efficacious in two evaluator-blinded trials of complicated skin  and soft tissue infections with clinical success rates similar for daptomycin and comparators (vancomycin or penicillinase-resistant penicillins). with its activity against key gram-positive pathogens, including resistant strains, daptomycin has potential as a valuable addition to the available treatment options for serious gram-positive infections.

AB  == objectives: the existing therapeutic options for complicated urinary tract infections (uti) caused by gram-positive uropathogens are not always optimal. therefore, newer antimicrobials have to be assessed. methods: the antimicrobial activity of daptomycin was tested versus linezolid, vancomycin, and ampicillin (enterococci on ly), against pathogens from three different collections: (1) uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients with complicated and/or hospital-acquired utis of the urologic clinic, hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. (2) uropathogens from a multicenter study comprising 37 urological centers throughout germany. (3) methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolates of patients and staff within the hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of daptomycin, linezolid, vancomycin, and ampicillin (only tested against enterococci) were determined by an agar dilution method using a multipointer with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point. results: for all methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n = 25), mrsa (n = 49), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 129), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 33), for enterococcus faecalis (n = 289), and for enterococcus faecium (n =  4) the mics ranged up to 2 mg/l (daptomycin, linezolid), up to 4 mg/l (vancomycin), and up to 8 mg/l (ampicillin, enterococci only) indicating that all strains were susceptible to the antibiotics tested. conclusions: according to the in vitro activity daptomycin may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of complicated uti caused by gram-positive uropathogens. thus,  daptomycin should be evaluated in a clinical study.

TI  == human defensins.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi. the eukaryotic  antimicrobial peptides may be divided into four distinct groups according to their structural features: cysteine-free alpha-helices, extended cysteine-free alpha-helices with a predominance of one or two amino acids, loop structures with one intramolecular disulfide bond, and beta-sheet structures which are stabilised by two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds. mammalian defensins are part of the last-mentioned group. the mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: the alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and the recently described theta-defensins. mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal paneth cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. recently, two novel human beta-defensins, human  beta-defensin-3 (hbd-3), and human beta-defensin-4 (hbd-4) have been discovered.  similar to hbd-1 and hbd-2, hbd-3 has microbicidal activity towards the gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli) and the yeasts  candida albicans and malassezia furfur. in addition, hbd-3 kills gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant s. aureus strains, and even vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. in contrast to hbd-1 and hbd-2, significant expression of hbd-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues, such as leukocytes, heart and skeletal muscle. hbd-4 is expressed in certain epithelia and in neutrophils. its bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa is stronger than that of the other known beta-defensins. here we present an overview of human antimicrobial peptides with some emphasis on their antifungal properties.

AB  == objective: accidentally, some enterococcus faecalis strains were found to inhibit the hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. the study objectives were to define the conditions under which this phenomenon appears and  to characterize the inhibitory agent. materials and methods: ninety-one wild strains and five type strains of e. faecalis and nine wild e. faecium strains were tested for antihemolytic activity on blood agar with 5% sheep erythrocytes prepared using the following agar bases: columbia agar base (bbl, 211124), columbia agar (bio merieux, 51026), blood agar base (bio-rad, 64524), blood agar  base (columbia) (ferosa, 1-034), columbia blood agar base (himedia, m114), blood  agar base no. 4 (imuna), columbia agar base (merck, 10455) and columbia agar base (oxoid, cm331). the exosubstance produced by e. faecalis strains was isolated by  means of acetone precipitation and was exposed to elevated temperature and trypsin. results: thirty-three (36%) out of 91 wild strains of e. faecalis produced the substance inhibiting hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. two out of five e. faecalis type strains and none of e. faecium strains appeared to be producers of the same substance. inhibition of the hemolysis was observed on all of the media tested, being the most pronounced with the use of blood agar base no. 4 (imuna) and columbia agar base (bbl) at ph 7.0-7.5 when cultured at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. the exosubstance lost its inhibitory effect after exposure to 70 degrees c for 15 min and to 0.1% trypsin for 30 min. the inhibitory potential against staphylococcal hemolysis correlated  with the ability of strains to produce protease. conclusion: about one third of wild e. faecalis strains produce a protease-like substance that seems proteinaceous in nature and has an inhibitory effect on the hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin.

TI  == survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  == in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee  for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and  an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linezolid in obese patients with cellulitis.
AB  == background: linezolid is an oxazolidinone antimicrobial with excellent oral bioavailability and tissue penetration and is active against multidrug-resistant  skin/soft tissue pathogens. objective: to study the pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity of linezolid against selective skin/soft tissue pathogens  in obese patients. methods: we obtained multiple serum samples from 7 obese patients (>50% over their calculated ideal body weight) receiving oral linezolid  600 mg every 12 hours for treatment of cellulitis. following a minimum of 3 doses, serum concentrations of linezolid were measured in each subject prior to (trough) and 1 and 6 hours after a dose. these samples were then tested against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (linezolid minimum inhibitory concentrations [mics] 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 microg/ml) and  one strain each of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) (mic 2.0 microg/ml), bacteroides fragilis (mic 2.0 microg/ml), and peptostreptococcus magnus (mic 1.0 microg/ml). serum inhibitory titers (sits) and bactericidal titers (sbts) were measured at each time point, and the median activity for these 7 patients was calculated. results: mean linezolid serum concentrations were 4.2, 12.3, and 7.2 microg/ml at these respective time points. median sits for 12 hours (100% of the dosing interval) were observed against each organism with the exception of the least susceptible strain of mrsa (mic 4.0 microg/ml); serum inhibitory activity was observed only at the one-hour time point against this isolate. furthermore, prolonged (> or =6 h) median sbts were observed against one isolate of mrsa (mic 1.0 microg/ml) as well as the strain of vre and p. magnus. conclusions: serum concentrations of oral linezolid in this patient population were diminished compared with those of healthy volunteers, but still provided prolonged serum inhibitory activity against common pathogens associated with skin/soft tissue infections. one treatment concern would be an obese patient receiving oral linezolid who was infected with a less susceptible (mic > or =4.0  microg/ml) strain of s. aureus. bactericidal activity was also observed against selective pathogens.

TI  == enhanced resistance to erythromycin is conferred by the enterococcal msrc determinant in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == objectives: the msrc gene, found on the chromosome of enterococcus faecium, shares a high degree of similarity with the staphylococcal erythromycin resistance determinant msr(a). the enterococcal determinant was cloned into staphylococcus aureus to determine whether msrc could confer antibiotic resistance in staphylococci. methods: a shuttle vector comprising pbluescript and psk265 was used to introduce multiple copies of msrc into s. aureus rn4220. the integration vector pcl84 was employed to insert a single copy of msrc into the s. aureus chromosome. mics were determined by the broth microdilution method. results: expression of msrc from both chromosomal and plasmid loci in erythromycin-susceptible s. aureus rn4220 (mic 0.25 mg/l) gave rise to enhanced protection against erythromycin, with an mic of 32-64 mg/l for s. aureus rn4220 containing msrc in multiple copies and an mic of 16-64 mg/l with msrc inserted as a single copy in the s. aureus chromosome. conclusions: msrc mediates high-level  resistance to erythromycin in s. aureus.

AB  == a surveillance study was performed throughout germany from november 2001 to june  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for mic determination. susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. the prevalence of  linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in streptococcus agalactiae. linezolid resistance was not detected in streptococcus pneumoniae or  in viridans group streptococci. sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (mic90, 1-2 mg/l). the prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in germany. organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an  alternative method or in a reference laboratory.

TI  == [salicylanilides: still a potential antibacterially active group].
AB  == the review presents a survey of potential biologically active salicylanilides, focusing particularly on their antibacterial activity. emergence of bacterial resistance to a large number of antibacterial agents represents a major world-wide problem. on that account, perpetual attention is paid to the preparation of new bioactive antibacterial compounds. salicylanilides belong to the group of compounds that have shown activity against gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, the strains representing the most significant problem in clinical practice. in 1998, a new mechanism of their action was proposed. salicylanilides are inhibitors of two-component regulatory systems in bacteria. electron-accepting substituents on the salicylic and hydrophobic groups on the anilide ring are most essential for the activity, but other electronic and structural parameters may also play an important role. our aim, based on sar analysis, is to develop new active drugs esterified by amino acid and later peptides. furthermore, analogues carrying the hydroxybenzamide moiety may uncouple oxidative phosphorylation.

TI  == successful treatment of chronic bone and joint infections with oral linezolid.
AB  == linezolid is an attractive alternative for the treatment of chronic bone and joint infections because it is active against common pathogens including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci and because its oral formulation is convenient for long-term administration. to evaluate the ability of linezolid to produce long-term remission, we prospectively monitored 11 consecutive adult patients who received linezolid for  osteomyelitis (n = 9) or prosthetic joint infection (n = 2). linezolid 600 mg was administered orally twice daily for a mean of 10 weeks (range, 6 to 19 weeks). pathogens were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 4), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (n = 1), and vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecalis (n = 1). after a mean followup of 27 months (range, 17 to 41 months), all 11 patients had remission by clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria. during week 8 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed a gram-negative superinfection, which resolved with appropriate therapy. during week 6 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed mild thrombocytopenia and another patient developed mild anemia. both episodes of myelosuppression were reversible within 10 days after completing the planned 6-week courses of linezolid. we recommend weekly complete blood counts to detect  hematologic abnormalities. we conclude that oral linezolid seems to be a useful and convenient alternative for the treatment of bone and joint infections.

TI  == usnic acid, a natural antimicrobial agent able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on polymer surfaces.
AB  == in modern medicine, artificial devices are used for repair or replacement of damaged parts of the body, delivery of drugs, and monitoring the status of critically ill patients. however, artificial surfaces are often susceptible to colonization by bacteria and fungi. once microorganisms have adhered to the surface, they can form biofilms, resulting in highly resistant local or systemic  infections. at this time, the evidence suggests that (+)-usnic acid, a secondary  lichen metabolite, possesses antimicrobial activity against a number of planktonic gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus  faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. since lichens are surface-attached communities that produce antibiotics, including usnic acid, to protect themselves from colonization by other bacteria, we hypothesized that the mode of action of usnic acid may be utilized in the control of medical biofilms. we loaded (+)-usnic acid into modified polyurethane and quantitatively assessed the capacity of (+)-usnic acid to control biofilm formation by either s. aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa under laminar flow conditions by using image analysis. (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymers did not inhibit the initial attachment of s. aureus cells, but killing the attached cells resulted in the inhibition of biofilm. interestingly, although p. aeruginosa biofilms did form on the surface of (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymer, the morphology of the biofilm was altered, possibly indicating that (+)-usnic acid interfered with signaling pathways.

TI  == in vitro testing of antimicrobial activity of bone cement.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to establish a reliable and cost-effective microplate proliferation assay for in vitro antimicrobial testing of bone cement  samples. cement samples devoid of antimicrobial agents, loaded with 2% gentamicin or with different concentrations of high-porosity silver, were incubated in a 96-well microplate with several staphylococcal, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecium isolates exhibiting different susceptibilities to gentamicin. after being rinsed, the samples were brought into a soy medium in which adherent cells on the cement surface either were killed by the antimicrobial surface or started to release clonal counterparts. the medium was monitored in real time by recording a time proliferation curve for each well. microplate testing revealed no antibacterial effect of plain bone cement. the antibacterial activity of gentamicin-loaded bone cement was shown by the microplate test to depend on the gentamicin susceptibilities of the strains. the  effect of high-porosity silver was dose dependent. bactericidal activity against  all tested strains was found for bone cement loaded with 1% high-porosity silver. the accuracy of this new proliferation assay was shown by the high correlation between the types of proliferation curves and antibiotic susceptibility. in contrast to routine agar diffusion testing, it assesses the dynamic response of microorganisms to antimicrobial agents in biomaterials and allows high-throughput screening and detection of antimicrobial properties of poorly water-soluble compounds like silver.

TI  == a review of linezolid: the first oxazolidinone antibiotic.
AB  == resistance of gram-positive bacterial pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium, to existing antibiotics continues to increase, and new  antibiotics with activity against these pathogens are in demand. linezolid (zyvox, pharmacia and upjohn) is the first agent of a new class of antibiotics called the oxazolidinones. linezolid possesses excellent microbial activity against a wide variety of gram-positive pathogens including those resistant to methicillin and vancomycin (vancocin, eli lilly). linezolid is available for intravenous and oral administration and possesses excellent bioavailability. it exhibits good penetration into pulmonary, as well as skin and related structure tissues, and does not require dosage adjustment in hepatic or renal dysfunction.  linezolid is generally well-tolerated, with the predominant adverse effect manifesting as a duration dependent, reversible thrombocytopenia. linezolid possesses monoamine oxidase inhibitor activity and caution is warranted with coadministration of adrenergic or seritonergic medications. clinical trials conducted with linezolid in skin and structure infections, lower respiratory tract infections and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections demonstrate that linezolid is an effective therapy. recent data suggest that linezolid may be superior to vancomycin for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus. linezolid is an excellent and promising new antibiotic for the treatment of resistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == international dissemination of antibiotic resistant strains of bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the increasing incidence of methicillin and multiple resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in nosocomial infections is mainly associated with a wide, international dissemination of well defined clonal lineages (epidemic mrsa) which are clearly different from community acquired mrsa by molecular typing patterns and structure of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome containing the meca gene. although belonging to a definite subpopulation within the species enterococcus faecium, hospital associated vancomycin resistant isolates also containing the esp gene have very likely evolved by acquisition of glycopeptide resistance gene  clusters at different occasions and at different times by a susceptible already disseminated clonal lineage. there is obviously a continuous selection of new types of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae and also horizontal spread of bla-genes. intrahospital dissemination of particular strains has often been observed, however, an international dissemination until now has been described only for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium producing the ctx-m-3 enzyme. multiresistant isolates of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium phage type dt104 harbour a multiresistant gene cluster with resistance genes from taxonomically more unrelated species (tetg, flor, bla(pse1)). although in vitro transduction has been demonstrated, this gene cluster has only rarely been reported from isolates exhibiting other phage patterns of the same serovar or from other serovars of s. enterica.

TI  == bacteriology and somatic cell counts in milk samples from ewes on a scottish farm.
AB  == milk samples from 50 sheep on a single scottish research farm were collected weekly for 10 wk postpartum. samples were analyzed for somatic cell counts (scc)  each week and bacteriologic culture was done for 7 of the 10 wk. a total of 492 udder half samples were cultured, of which 467 had corresponding cell count data. statistical analysis on complete scc and culture data showed no association between scc and bacterial isolation, even when more than 10 colonies of a single  bacterial species were present. only 3.6% of the samples were simultaneously positive for high count (> 10 colonies from 0.01 ml of milk) of any one bacterial species and high scc (> 1 x 10(6)/ml). the bacteria recovered were: staphylococcus equorum (19 times), s. xylosus (7 times), s. simulans (6 times), streptococcus uberis (3 times) and other streptococci (4 times), mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica (2 times), staphylococcus aureus (1 time), s. capitis (1 time), and enterococcus faecium (1 time). there was an association between the test day and scc, with higher scc values in the first 2 wk. in addition, significantly higher scc values were found in the oldest animals compared to the  other age groups.

TI  == [antibacterial effectiveness of high-energetic extracorporeal shock waves: an in  vitro verification].
AB  == aim: extracorporeal shock wave therapy (eswt) is used for a multitude of different indications in modern orthopedics. local bacterial infections, like infected pseudarthrosis, are still considered as contraindications. the goal of the present study was to determine the effect of eswt on the growth of clinically relevant bacteria in orthopedic and trauma surgery. methods: standardized suspensions of five bacterial strains of bone and implant-associated infections were treated with 4 000 impulses of high-energy shock waves with an energy flux density (ed) of 0.96 mj/mm (2) and a frequency of 2 hz. subsequently, viable bacteria were quantified and compared with an untreated control. results: a highly significant antibacterial effect of the eswt was demonstrated for all bacterial strains with a reduction of growth to values between 1.1 % and 29.7 % (p < 0.01). reference strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis reacted with the highest sensitivity whereas enterococcus faecium demonstrated the highest resistance towards high-energy shock waves. conclusion:  eswt proved to exert a significant antibacterial effect on clinically relevant pathogens. further investigations on energy flux density and impulse rates might  contribute to an optimization of the bactericidal effectiveness. infections as possible indications of the eswt should therefore be assessed in further studies  and the clinical relevance should be verified in an animal model.

TI  == nosocomial bloodstream infections in us hospitals: analysis of 24,179 cases from  a prospective nationwide surveillance study.
AB  == background: nosocomial bloodstream infections (bsis) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the united states. methods: data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study (surveillance and control of pathogens of epidemiological importance [scope]) were used to examine the secular trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of nosocomial bsis. results: our study detected 24,179 cases of nosocomial bsi in 49 us hospitals over a 7-year period from march 1995 through september 2002 (60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). eighty-seven percent of bsis were monomicrobial. gram-positive organisms caused 65% of these bsis, gram-negative organisms caused 25%, and fungi caused 9.5%. the crude mortality rate was 27%. the most-common organisms causing bsis were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (31% of isolates), staphylococcus aureus  (20%), enterococci (9%), and candida species (9%). the mean interval between admission and infection was 13 days for infection with escherichia coli, 16 days  for s. aureus, 22 days for candida species and klebsiella species, 23 days for enterococci, and 26 days for acinetobacter species. cons, pseudomonas species, enterobacter species, serratia species, and acinetobacter species were more likely to cause infections in patients in intensive care units (p<.001). in neutropenic patients, infections with candida species, enterococci, and viridans  group streptococci were significantly more common. the proportion of s. aureus isolates with methicillin resistance increased from 22% in 1995 to 57% in 2001 (p<.001, trend analysis). vancomycin resistance was seen in 2% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and in 60% of enterococcus faecium isolates. conclusion: in this study, one of the largest multicenter studies performed to date, we found that the proportion of nosocomial bsis due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in us hospitals.

TI  == emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a european and north american surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  == background: globally icus are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. methods: antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant icu pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from the surveillance network (tsn) databases in europe (france, germany and italy), canada, and the united states (us). results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. penicillin resistance  rates among streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in germany to as high as 20.2% in the us; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in germany to 3.4% in italy. vancomycin resistance rates among enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in france to 76.3% in the united states. putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production among enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among escherichia coli in the five countries studied. ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower  than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the enterobacteriaceae species examined. fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for e. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). p. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. imipenem was the most active compound tested against acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. conclusion: there was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. compared with other countries, italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of enterococcus spp., which were highest in the us. this data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in europe and north america and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.

TI  == synthesis of mosaic peptidoglycan cross-bridges by hybrid peptidoglycan assembly  pathways in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the peptidoglycan cross-bridges of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis,  and enterococcus faecium consist of the sequences gly(5), l-ala(2), and d-asx, respectively. expression of the fmhb, fema, and femb genes of s. aureus in e. faecalis led to the production of peptidoglycan precursors substituted by mosaic  side chains that were efficiently used by the penicillin-binding proteins for cross-bridge formation. the fem transferases were specific for incorporation of glycyl residues at defined positions of the side chains in the absence of any additional s. aureus factors such as trnas used for amino acid activation. the pbps of e. faecalis displayed a broad substrate specificity because mosaic side chains containing from 1 to 5 residues and gly instead of l-ala at the n-terminal position were used for peptidoglycan cross-linking. low affinity pbp2a of s. aureus conferred beta-lactam resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium, thereby indicating that there was no barrier to heterospecific expression of resistance caused by variations in the structure of peptidoglycan precursors. thus, conservation of the structure of the peptidoglycan cross-bridges in members of the same species reflects the high specificity of the enzymes for side chain synthesis, although this is not essential for the activity of the pbps.

TI  == evaluation of the prevalence and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus among patients on dialysis.
AB  == background: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) has been reported among long-term dialysis patients, although risk factors for vre colonization are not well defined. this study aims to appraise the prevalence and risk factors for vre colonization among patients on long-term dialysis therapy, as well as the mechanisms for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. methods: this is a cross-sectional survey of 320 patients on long-term dialysis therapy at 2 hospitals of the federal university of sao paulo from june 2001 to march 2003. fecal samples were collected from each patient once a week for 1 month. samples with positive test results for vre were submitted to molecular typing through automated ribotyping. results: vre prevalence was 14.4%. there were significant associations between vre and dialysis type (hemodialysis, p = 0.04), number of hospitalizations (p = 0.03), low hemoglobin level (p = 0.03), and leukocytosis (p = 0.05). among samples with vre (n = 56), 25% were enterococcus faecium; 10.7%, enterococcus casseliflavus; 57.1%, enterococcus gallinarum; and 3.6%, enterococcus faecalis. all samples isolated were sensitive to teicoplanin, except for e faecium samples, which were strongly resistant, although 9 of 14 patients with this isolate presented the same ribogroup (111-s-4). typing of 6 samples from 8 dialysis patients with e gallinarum was performed, showing a predominant ribogroup (112-s-4). conclusion: hospital environment, hemodialysis, anemia, and  leukocytosis appear to be associated with vre colonization. these results suggest that dissemination of these bacteria among patients on long-term dialysis therapy may be taking place.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == bacillus clausii probiotic strains: antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities.
AB  == the clinical benefits observed with probiotic use are mainly attributed to the antimicrobial substances produced by probiotic strains and to their immunomodulatory effects. currently, the best-documented probiotic bacteria used  in human therapy are lactic acid bacteria. in contrast, studies aiming to characterize the mechanisms responsible for the probiotic beneficial effects of bacillus are rare. the current work seeks to contribute to such characterization  by evaluating the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities of probiotic b. clausii strains. b. clausii strains release antimicrobial substances in the medium. moreover, the release of these antimicrobial substances was observed during stationary growth phase and coincided with sporulation. these substances were active against gram-positive bacteria, in particular against staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecium, and clostridium difficile. the antimicrobial activity was resistant to subtilisin, proteinase k, and chymotrypsin treatment, whereas it was sensitive to pronase treatment. the evaluation of the immunomodulatory properties of probiotic b. clausii strains was performed in vitro on swiss and c57 bl/6j murine cells. the authors demonstrate that these strains, in their vegetative forms, are able to induce nos ii synthetase activity, ifn-gamma production, and cd4 t-cell proliferation.

TI  == results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study of two doses of tigecycline for complicated skin and skin-structure infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  == background: tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic being investigated for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. tigecycline has been shown to be efficacious against serious infections in animals, and preliminary studies in healthy adults have shown that tigecycline has an acceptable tolerability profile. objective: this study compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and tolerability of 2 doses of tigecycline in hospitalized patients with a complicated skin and skin-structure infection (csssi). methods: this phase ii, randomized, open-label study was conducted between september 1999 and march 2001  at 14 investigative centers across the united states. patients were randomized to receive tigecycline 25 or 50 mg iv q12h for 7 to 14 days. the primary efficacy end point was the clinically observed cure rate among clinically evaluable (ce) patients at the test-of-cure visit. secondary end points were the clinical cure rate at the end of treatment and bacteriologic response in microbiologically evaluable (me) patients. also, in vitro tests of susceptibility to tigecycline were performed for selected pathogens known to cause skin infections, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus  faecium. tolerability assessments also were conducted. results: a total of 160 patients received > or =1 dose of tigecycline; 109 patients were ce, and 91 were  me. the majority of patients (74%) were men, and the mean (sd) age was 49.0 (14.8) years. at the test-of-cure visit, the clinical cure rate in the 25-mg group was 67% (95% ci, 53.3%-79.3%) and in the 50-mg group was 74% (95% ci, 60.3%-85.0%). in the 25-mg group, 56% of the patients had eradication (95% ci, 40.0%-70.4%) of the pathogens compared with 69% (95% ci, 54.2%-82.3%) in the 50-mg group. values for the minimum concentration of tigecycline that is inhibitory for 90% of all isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 microg/ml for the selected pathogens. both tigecycline doses were generally well tolerated. nausea  and vomiting were the most common adverse events. conclusions: in this study, tigecycline appeared efficacious and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of hospitalized patients with csssi. in patients who received 50-mg doses of tigecycline q12h, the clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 74% and 70%, respectively, and were 67% and 56% in patients who received 25-mg doses.

AB  == vancomycin resistance in enterococci, predominantly enterococcus faecium, developed in the latter half of the 1980s, and the long anticipated development of vancomycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus has now occurred. a number of vancomycin-intermediate strains have been described, and these strains have abnormal, thickened cell walls in the presence of vancomycin. two mechanisms of resistance have been described in the strains: affinity trapping of vancomycin molecules by cell wall monomers and clogging of the outer layers of peptidoglycan by bound vancomycin molecules, and change in the structure or metabolism of teichoic acids. of more serious concern has been the description in 2002 of two patients with vancomycin-resistant s aureus infections. in one instance, the patient had skin lesions coinfected with vancomycin resistant, vana genotype, e faecalis, and the vana resistance genes could have been transferred to the s aureus strain. expression of resistance was high in one s aureus strain and low in the other, making detection more challenging in the latter instance. these developments are of great concern, and every effort should be made to prevent further development and spread of vancomycin resistance in staphylococci.

AB  == the serious medical consequences and costly management of infections associated with vascular grafts have prompted an expanding interest in examining the preventive efficacy of antimicrobial-coated vascular grafts. the purpose of antimicrobial coating of vascular grafts is to reduce bacterial colonization of the device and, hopefully, the occurrence of clinical infection. in this study we demonstrated that expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts coated with minocycline and rifampin provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro,  as reflected by zones of inhibition, against staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus faecium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we also showed in a rabbit model that subcutaneously placed minocycline/rifampin-coated vascular grafts have lower rates of staphylococcal device colonization (1/24 = 4% vs. 8/30 = 27%, p = 0.033) and device-related infection (0/24 = 0% vs. 6/30 = 20%, p = 0.028) than uncoated grafts. these promising results encourage the clinical evaluation of vascular grafts coated with minocycline and rifampin.

TI  == [vancomycin resistant enterococci in the netherlands].
AB  == enterococci (enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium) are relatively avirulent enteric bacteria that usually only cause infections in immunocompromised patients. antimicrobial treatment, however, is hampered as enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. for years, vancomycin was considered the last available antibiotic. plasmid-mediated resistance against vancomycin among enterococci was first described in the nineteen-eighties and since then incidences of infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have increased dramatically, especially in the united states. in 2000, three outbreaks of vre occurred in hospitals in the netherlands and a set of infection-control measures was proposed to limit further transmission. these measures were based on the simultaneous isolation of vre from multiple patients. all three outbreaks were controlled by these measures and no new outbreaks in dutch hospitals have been reported since then. epidemiological studies have shown that hospital outbreaks on three continents were caused by a subpopulation of e. faecium, which is characterized by the presence of a potential virulence gene (variant esp) and resistance to amoxicillin. this 'hospital strain' of e. faecium has probably been prevalent within hospital settings for some time, but only became clinically relevant when it had acquired  vancomycin-resistance. current advice is to implement the set of infection control measures formulated in 2000, only in those patients colonized by amoxicillin-resistant vre. the potential dangers of vre were recently underlined  by the proven transmission of the vancomycin-resistance gene from vre to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in two patients in the united  states. it is in the interest of the patients that prevalence of vre and mrsa in  dutch hospitals should be kept as low as possible.

TI  == influence of protein binding under controlled conditions on the bactericidal activity of daptomycin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  == objective: daptomycin exhibits bactericidal activity against clinically significant gram-positive bacteria despite being highly bound to human proteins.  evaluations characterizing the effect of protein on daptomycin pharmacodynamics are warranted. methods: we utilized an in vitro pharmacodynamic model to simulate daptomycin regimens of 6 mg/kg/day under controlled conditions of ph, calcium and/or protein. free concentrations were simulated in broth, whereas total concentrations were simulated in broth supplemented with human albumin. bacterial density was profiled over 48 h for two methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and two vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) clinical isolates. results: daptomycin exhibited bactericidal activity against both mrsa isolates, with time to 99.9% killing occurring at 0.5 h and 8 h in broth and in albumin-supplemented broth, respectively. initial kill was observed against both  vref isolates followed by regrowth. there was no statistical difference (p>0.05)  in extent of bacterial kill at 24 or 48 h between the different media. conclusions: although delayed, the extent of kill for daptomycin was unaltered against all isolates in albumin-supplemented broth. further antimicrobial studies that incorporate protein are warranted to assess the influence of protein in the  pharmacodynamic evaluation of antimicrobials.

AB  == background: bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. methods: from january to december of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa by 268 laboratories. susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), escherichia coli (7.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. in vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (99.8%), e. coli (97.3%), k. pneumoniae (93.3%),  and streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for k. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), e. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), e. faecalis (52.1%), and e. faecium (11.3%). combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or  both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range,  74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). conclusion: ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.

TI  == characterization of an inducible vancomycin resistance system in streptomyces coelicolor reveals a novel gene (vank) required for drug resistance.
AB  == vancomycin is the front-line therapy for treating problematic infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and the spread of vancomycin resistance is an acute problem. vancomycin blocks cross-linking between peptidoglycan intermediates by binding to the d-ala-d-ala termini of bacterial cell wall precursors, which are the substrate of transglycosylase/transpeptidase. we have characterized a cluster of seven genes (vansrjkhax) in streptomyces coelicolor that confers inducible, high-level vancomycin resistance. vanhax are orthologous to genes found in vancomycin-resistant enterococci that encode enzymes predicted to reprogramme peptidoglycan biosynthesis such that cell wall precursors terminate in d-ala-d-lac rather than d-ala-d-ala. vanr and vans encode a two-component signal  transduction system that mediates transcriptional induction of the seven van genes. vanj and vank are novel genes that have no counterpart in previously characterized vancomycin resistance clusters from pathogens. vank is a member of  the fem family of enzymes that add the cross-bridge amino acids to the stem pentapeptide of cell wall precursors, and vank is essential for vancomycin resistance. the van genes are organized into four transcription units, vanrs, vanj, vank and vanhax, and these transcripts are induced by vancomycin in a vanr-dependent manner. to develop a sensitive bioassay for inducers of the vancomycin resistance system, the promoter of vanj was fused to a reporter gene conferring resistance to kanamycin. all the inducers identified were glycopeptide antibiotics, but teicoplanin, a membrane-anchored glycopeptide, failed to act as  an inducer. analysis of mutants defective in the vanrs and csebc cell envelope signal transduction systems revealed significant cross-talk between the two pathways.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland 2001-2002: the bsac bacteraemia resistance surveillance programme.
AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. methods: in 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group b isolates (82% resistant). nine  percent of s. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l), but none required >/=2 mg/l for inhibition. high-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin mics (>/=32 mg/l), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of enterococcus faecium. vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of e. faecium, 3% of e. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, mic of 8 mg/l). escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of e. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of klebsiella spp. and 8% of enterobacter spp. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in gram-positive organisms. ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. mics of tigecycline were low for gram-positive species and enterobacteriaceae except proteeae and enterobacter spp. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. an important exception was oxacillin resistance in s. aureus.

TI  == linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance in vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus prior to clinical use in turkey.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of recently licensed quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid which have not yet been in clinical use in turkey against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) strains isolated from various clinical specimens by using the etest. the results showed that all mrsa strains were fully susceptible to both the new compounds. all strains were inhibited by 1 mg/l quinupristin/dalfopristin (mode mic 0.38 mg/l) and by 3 mg/l linezolid (mode mic 1.5 mg/l). four strains of enterococcus faecium showed an increase of resistance of 2-3 mg/l to quinupristin/dalfopristin (susceptible mode mic 0.38 mg/l). with linezolid, all strains except two fell within the range 0.75-2.0 mg/l.

TI  == antimicrobial activity in methanolic extracts of several plant species from northern argentina.
AB  == thirty-nine native plant species were collected from the provinces of chaco and formosa, in northern argentina, and were screened for antimicrobial activity. the plants were dried and extracted thoroughly with methanol. the dry extracts, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, were tested for inhibition of microbial growth via microplate assay with an oxidation-reduction dye. the test organisms were: escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. inhibition of respiratory activities in some of these microbial species was produced by the extracts of astronium balansae, geoffroea decorticans, peltophorum dubium, geoffroea spinosa, lantana balansae, prosopis kuntzei, prosopis ruscifolia and bulnesia sarmientoi, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 0.08 to 0.5 mg dry matter/ml. further in vitro experiments measuring the growth of s. aureus in liquid culture confirmed that all of the above extracts at 2 x mic were able to inhibit bacterial growth effectively, and that some of them (a.  balansae, g. decorticans, p. dubium, g. spinosa, p. kuntzei and b. sarmientoi) were able to reduce the initial number of viable counts by at least one order of  magnitude in 10 hours, indicating that these extracts should be investigated further for the possible presence of bactericidal components.

TI  == algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time lightcycler polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  == we developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including staphylococcus spp., s. epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of e. faecalis and e. faecium), streptococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, enterobacteriaceae, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., bacteroides spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. a total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific pcr algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the pcr results were compared to the culture results. apart from-cross reactions between e. coli and chryseomonas luteola and enterococcus faecium and e. durans, the pcr assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the pcr algorithm within a few hours. however, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. the pcr algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in  positive blood cultures.

TI  == comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492, was determined. methods: mics were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. the effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. results: mic data indicate that abt-492 has potent activity against gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis but not enterococcus  faecium. abt-492 was the most active agent tested against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. good activity was observed for abt-492 amongst the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of proteus, morganella and providencia, as well as  for pseudomonas spp. in common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms  with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised mic(90)s to abt-492. the  one isolate of h. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an abt-492 mic close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. abt-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against chlamydia spp. an inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, e. faecium, klebsiella spp. and  escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised mics in the presence of 70% serum protein. the clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. conclusions: abt-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.

TI  == calcium-supplemented daptomycin etest strips for susceptibility testing on iso-sensitest agar.
AB  == objective: iso-sensitest agar (isa), which is recommended by the bsac for routine susceptibility testing of staphylococci and enterococci, contains insufficient calcium for testing daptomycin. isotonic agar supplemented with 50 mg/l calcium has been advocated, but is not routinely available in many laboratories. we evaluated a daptomycin etest that incorporates a constant level of calcium throughout the daptomycin gradient, designed to give an appropriate concentration around the strip during testing, as an alternative for susceptibility testing on  isa. methods: ninety-one isolates of staphylococcus aureus (45 methicillin-susceptible, 46 methicillin-resistant) and 90 enterococci (47 enterococcus faecalis, 43 enterococcus faecium) were tested. daptomycin etest mics were determined on isa, whereas agar dilution mics were determined in parallel on isotonic agar supplemented with calcium to 50 mg/l as a control. results: the agar dilution and etest mic ranges of daptomycin for s. aureus were  0.25-1 mg/l (mode 0.5 mg/l), and 0.125-2 mg/l (mode 0.25 mg/l), respectively. the corresponding mic values for enterococci were 0.25-4 mg/l (mode, 1 mg/l) and 0.125-4 mg/l (mode, 2 mg/l). for staphylococci, 86% of the etest mic results were within one dilution of the agar dilution values, and for enterococci, 90% of the  etest mic results met these criteria. when results from the two methods were not  identical, there was a tendency for the etest mic values to be lower than the agar dilution values. conclusions: this study shows that calcium-supplemented daptomycin etests on isa are an accurate and convenient alternative to calcium-supplemented isotonic agar.

TI  == activity of linezolid against gram-positive cocci isolated in french hospitals as determined by three in-vitro susceptibility testing methods.
AB  == in total, 844 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected from six university hospitals in france between september 1999 and january 2000. mics of linezolid were determined: (i) for all strains by agar dilution (method a); (ii) by broth microdilution (method b) for staphylococci and enterococci; (iii) by etest (method e) for beta-haemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. susceptibility to other antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method.  mic50 and mic90 values were identical (2 mg/l) for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n = 179) by methods a and b. linezolid was active against  methicillin-resistant s. aureus (n = 117), with an mic90 of 2 mg/l (methods a and b), but with a lower mic50 of 1 mg/l by method a. of the 200 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 56.5% were methicillin-resistant and 43.5% were methicillin-susceptible. linezolid had similar in-vitro activity by methods a and b (mic50 and mic90 values of 1-2 mg/l), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility. the mic90 of linezolid for all enterococci (150 enterococcus faecalis and 50 enterococcus faecium) was 2 mg/l by both methods. mics of linezolid for beta-haemolytic streptococci had a narrow range of 0.5-2 mg/l (method a) and 0.125-2 mg/l (method e). pneumococci (n = 118), including 67 penicillin g-intermediate and -resistant strains, were all inhibited by linezolid 2 mg/l (mic90 of 2 mg/l by methods a and e). no strain had an mic of > 2 mg/l by  agar dilution or etest, or of > 4 mg/l by broth microdilution. overall, the study confirmed the good in-vitro activity of linezolid and the very narrow range of mics for gram-positive cocci susceptible or resistant to other antibiotics, irrespective of the method used.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

TI  == high antibiotic susceptibility among bacterial pathogens in swedish icus. report  from a nation-wide surveillance program using ta90 as a novel index of susceptibility.
AB  == local infection control measures, antibiotic consumption and patient demographics from 1999-2000 together with bacteriological analyses were investigated in 29 icus participating in the icu-strama programme. the median antibiotic consumption per icu was 1147 (range 605-2143) daily doses per 1000 occupied bed d (ddd1000).  antibiotics to which > 90% of isolates of an organism were susceptible were defined as treatment alternatives (ta90). the mean number of ta90 was low (1-2 per organism) for enterococcus faecium (vancomycin:van), coagulase negative staphylococci (van), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ceftazidime:ctz, netilmicin: net) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (ctz, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: tsu), but higher (3-7) for acinetobacter spp. (imipenem:imi, net, tsu), enterococcus faecalis (ampicillin:amp, imi, van), serratia spp. (ciprofloxacin:cip, imi, net), enterobacter spp. (cip, imi, net, tsu), e. coli (cefuroxime:cxm, cefotaxime/eftazidime:ctx/ctz, cip, imi, net, piperacillin-tazobactam:ptz, tsu),  klebsiella spp. (ctx/ctz cip, imi, net, ptz, tsu) and staphylococcus aureus (clindamycin, fusidic acid, net, oxacillin, rifampicin, van). of s. aureus isolates 2% were mrsa. facilities for alcohol hand disinfection at each bed were  available in 96% of the icus. the numbers of ta90 available were apparently higher than in icus in southern europe and the us, despite a relatively high antibiotic consumption. this may be due to a moderate ecological impact of the used agents and the infection control routines in swedish icus.

AB  == objective: to review the resistance mechanisms of enterococcus and staphylococcus spp. and summarize quinupristin/dalfopristin's (qd's) effects on these resistant  organisms when combined with other antibiotics via review of the literature and unpublished data. data sources: data were identified by a pubmed search (1996-may 2003) using the search terms quinupristin/dalfopristin, synergy, in vitro, in vivo, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and individual antibiotic names. bibliographies of  the resultant pubmed searches were reviewed and included if applicable. study selection and data extraction: all studies reviewed were analyzed; specific drug  data were included only if clinically pertinent. in vitro data from studies with  adequate design were discussed, whereas all case reports and clinical trials were utilized. data synthesis: in the treatment of vref, available information seems conflicting, although some clear differences have become apparent. qd-ampicillin  and qd-doxycycline combinations have demonstrated beneficial activity, usually displaying synergistic or additive effects even in macrolide-, lincosamine-, and  streptogramin-resistant (mlsb) isolates. vancomycin and chloramphenicol have shown some efficacy, but antagonistic or null results also have been observed. regarding mrsa, results from many studies of qd combinations have been ambiguous. more common combinations displayed synergy or additive effects against mrsa, but  only qd-rifampin showed consistent beneficial activity against mrsa and mlsb isolates. most other combinations displayed antagonism when tested in vitro. conclusions: data supporting the use of various qd-antibiotic combinations against vref and mrsa are increasing, but further in vitro and in vivo data are needed to confirm the findings.

AB  == peptidoglycan polymerization complexes contain multimodular penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) of classes a and b that associate a conserved c-terminal transpeptidase module to an n-terminal glycosyltransferase or morphogenesis module, respectively. in enterococcus faecalis, class b pbp5 mediates intrinsic resistance to the cephalosporin class of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. to identify the glycosyltransferase partner(s) of pbp5, combinations of deletions were introduced in all three class a pbp genes of e. faecalis jh2-2  (pona, pbpf, and pbpz). among mutants with single or double deletions, only jh2-2 deltapona deltapbpf was susceptible to ceftriaxone. ceftriaxone resistance was restored by heterologous expression of pbpf from enterococcus faecium but not by  mgt encoding the monofunctional glycosyltransferase of staphylococcus aureus. thus, pbp5 partners essential for peptidoglycan polymerization in the presence of beta-lactams formed a subset of the class a pbps of e. faecalis, and heterospecific complementation was observed with an ortholog from e. faecium. site-directed mutagenesis of pbpf confirmed that the catalytic serine residue of  the transpeptidase module was not required for resistance. none of the three class a pbp genes was essential for viability, although deletion of the three genes led to an increase in the generation time and to a decrease in peptidoglycan cross-linking. as the e. faecalis chromosome does not contain any additional glycosyltransferase-related genes, these observations indicate that glycan chain polymerization in the triple mutant is performed by a novel type of  glycosyltransferase. the latter enzyme was not inhibited by moenomycin, since deletion of the three class a pbp genes led to high-level resistance to this glycosyltransferase inhibitor.

TI  == worldwide assessment of dalbavancin activity and spectrum against over 6,000 clinical isolates.
AB  == continuing emergence of new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and the increased frequency of existing resistances, requires the development of alternative antimicrobial agents. dalbavancin is an amide glycopeptide derivative with a markedly extended serum elimination half-life. dalbavancin and selected comparators were tested against 6,339 recent clinical isolates (2002) from the americas and europe using reference susceptibility testing methods. the general characteristics of this gram-positive organism collection were: oxacillin (oxa)-resistant staphylococcus aureus (orsa) at 39% of strains; vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) at 10%; and penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci at 28%. the overall distribution of dalbavancin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranged from < or = 0.015 to > 32 microg/ml, but > 99%  of mic results were at < or =1 microg/ml. s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were extremely susceptible to dalbavancin (mic90, 0.06 microg/ml) despite resistance patterns to other agents. dalbavancin was the most potent compound (by weight) against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and e.  faecium (mic90, 0.06 and 0.12 microg/ml, respectively); however, vre strains showed decreased dalbavancin susceptibility (mic50, 4 or 8 microg/ml). all streptococcal isolates were inhibited at < or =0.25 microg/ml of dalbavancin. this reported dalbavancin activity indicates that the new glycopeptide has significant activity, superior to available agents in the class, and a potency that was uniform across geographically sampled organisms. some vre were inhibited by very low dalbavancin concentrations (< or = 1 microg/ml; van b phenotypes). further clinical development seems warranted for this once-weekly administered agent.

TI  == increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa in korea: konsar study in 2001.
AB  == the 5th year konsar surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. it was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. resistance rates of gram-positive cocci were: 70% of staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. seventy-two percent of pneumococci were  nonsusceptible to penicillin. the resistance rates of enterobacteriaceae were: escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. the resistance rates of p. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. with the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.

TI  == in vivo pharmacodynamic activity of daptomycin.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria. we used the neutropenic murine thigh model to characterize the pharmacodynamics of daptomycin. icr/swiss mice were rendered neutropenic with cyclophosphamide; and the thigh muscles of the mice were infected with strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecium. animals were treated by subcutaneous injection of daptomycin at doses of 0.20 to 400 mg/kg of body weight/day divided into one, two, four, or eight doses over 24 h. daptomycin exhibited linear pharmacokinetics, with an area under the concentration-time curve (auc) from time zero to infinity/dose of 9.4 and a half-life of 0.9 to 1.4 h. the level of protein binding was 90%. free daptomycin exhibited concentration-dependent killing and produced in vivo postantibiotic effects (paes) of 4.8 to 10.8 h. nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which pharmacokinetic (pk) or pharmacodynamic (pd) parameter was important for efficacy by using free drug concentrations. the peak concentration/mic (peak/mic) ratio and 24-h auc/mic ratio were the pk and pd parameters that best correlated with in vivo efficacy (r(2) = 83 to 87% for peak/mic and r(2) = 86% for the auc/mic ratio, whereas r(2) = 47 to 50% for the time that the concentration was greater than the mic) against standard strains of s. aureus and s. pneumoniae. the peak/mic ratios required for a bacteriostatic effect ranged from 12 to 36 for s. pneumoniae, 59 to 94 for s. aureus, and 0.14 to 0.25 for e. faecium. the auc/mic ratios needed for a bacteriostatic effect ranged from 75 to 237 for s. pneumoniae, 388 to 537 for s.  aureus, and 0.94 to 1.67 for e. faecium. the free daptomycin concentrations needed to average from one to two times the mic over 24 h to produce a bacteriostatic effect and two to four times the mic over 24 h to produce greater  than 99% killing. the long pae and potent bactericidal activity make daptomycin an attractive option for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == bacteraemia in hospitalised patients with malignant blood disorders: a retrospective study of causative agents and their resistance profiles during a 14-year period without antibacterial prophylaxis.
AB  == bacteraemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological disorders during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. the generally reported trend during the last two decades has been a gradual replacement of gram-negative bacilli by gram-positive cocci as the major causes of bacteraemia in neutropenic hosts. however, data that are unaffected by the use of antibacterial prophylaxis are scarce. our objective therefore was to study the incidence of bacteraemia with different microorganisms in a haematology centre where antibacterial prophylaxis has not been used during the years 1988-2001. a total of 1402 episodes of clinically significant bacteraemia in 927 patients were identified. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and had an underlying haematological disorder, with lymphoma, leukaemia, and myeloma dominating. there were 536 (58%) male, and 391 (42%) female patients, with a median age of 58 years. the dominating pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) 17%, escherichia coli 16%, alpha-haemolytic streptococci 12%, staphylococcus aureus 9%, klebsiella spp 9%, enterococcus spp 7%, and pseudomonas spp 5%. the only significant incidence change was an increase of e. faecium bacteraemia. the balance between gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms was essentially stable over the 14-year period. the rates of antibiotic resistance were generally low and stable. gram-negative bacteria exhibited resistance to fluoroquinolones after 1998. the 7- and 30-day mortality rates were 6.3 and 15.6%, respectively, being significantly higher in patients with bacteraemia caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or e. faecium.

AB  == objective: to investigate the basic pharmacodynamic properties of teicoplanin in  vitro for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium. methods: the following experiments were performed: (1) bacterial killing by teicoplanin at different concentrations; (2) bacterial killing by teicoplanin  at 8 x mic against the same strains with inocula of 5 x 10(3), 5 x 10(5) and 5 x  10(7) cfu/ml; (3) studies of the postantibiotic effect (pae) and the postantibiotic sub-mic effect (pasme) of teicoplanin; (4) studies of the killing  by teicoplanin in an in vitro kinetic model following exposure to simulated human serum pharmacokinetic concentrations (6 mg/kg od at steady state). results: concentration-dependent killing was noted against s. epidermidis, with a > 4 log10 difference in cfus between 2 x mic and 64 x mic at 24 h. also, against s. aureus there was slight concentration-dependent killing, which, however, did not  reach 2 log10 cfu/ml. teicoplanin exerted a similar killing rate at all inocula for s. epidermidis, except for slower initial killing up to 6 h at the highest inoculum. in contrast, overall slower killing at all inocula was seen for s. aureus, where an inoculum effect was noted at the highest inoculum. for e. faecium, only a bacteriostatic effect was noted at all concentrations and inocula. no or very short paes were noted for the investigated strains. however,  when the strains in the postantibiotic phase were exposed to 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 x mic of teicoplanin (pasme), substantial prolongation of the paes was seen. although no significant killing was achieved in our kinetic model for any of the  strains, regrowth of s. epidermidis was noted first after 8 h, despite a t > mic24 of only 5% (1.2 h), illustrating the long post-mic effect for this strain.  for s. aureus, t > mic was 38%, and regrowth occurred later than for s. epidermidis. neither killing nor regrowth was seen for e. faecium with a t > mic24 of 27%. conclusion: teicoplanin exerted a concentration-dependent bactericidal effect against s. epidermidis, a less notable one against s. aureus, and a bacteriostatic effect against e. faecium. a reduced killing rate with increasing inocula was seen for s. aureus and also for s. epidermidis at the highest inoculum. no or very short paes were noted for the investigated strains,  but were substantially prolonged with the addition of subinhibitory concentrations. when human pharmacokinetics was simulated (6 mg/kg od at steady state) in the kinetic model, no net bactericidal effect was noted for any of the  strains at 24 h.

TI  == antibacterial activity of leontopodium alpinum (edelweiss).
AB  == extracts and individual constituents of leontopodium alpinum cass. (asteraceae) were tested for their antimicrobial activity in two different assays. extracts were screened in agar diffusion assays, whereas the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of single compounds were determined by the microbroth dilution method according to nccls criteria. significant antimicrobial activities were found against various strains of enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes strains. these results support the ethnomedicinal use of leontopodium alpinum for the treatment of respiratory and abdominal disorders.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of linezolid and five other antimicrobials against  nosocomial isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium.
AB  == the activity of linezolid in comparison to vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, clindamycin and gentamicin was tested against 60 strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 60 strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from patients with nosocomial infections and 24 strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium isolated from feces of hospitalized patients. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by the epsilometer test method. all tested strains were sensitive to linezolid and specifically all methicillin-resistant s. aureus had mic range 0.25-3.00, mic50 = 0.75, mic90 = 1.5, all methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis had mic range 0.125-1.5, mic50 = 0.5, mic90 = 1 and all vancomycin-resistant e. faecium had mic range 0.5-1.5, mic50 = 1, mic90 = 1. linezolid is the first of a novel antimicrobial class, the oxazolidinones, which is a promising treatment for serious gram-positive infections, including multiresistant strains.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == daptomycin against multiple drug-resistant staphylococcus and enterococcus isolates in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic that exhibits bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria. in pursuit of potential clinical dosing regimens  for endocarditis, we evaluated two, once-daily daptomycin regimens against multiple, drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. daptomycin susceptibility was determined in the absence and presence of physiologic concentrations of albumin.  an in vitro pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations incorporating protein was used to simulate regimens of daptomycin at 6 and 8 mg/kg/day and vancomycin at 1 g every 12 h against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa-67 and 494) and s. epidermidis (mrse-r227 and r617), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus and s. epidermidis (gisa-992 and gise-12333), and vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (vref-sf12047 and 12366). bacterial quantification occurred over 72 h. daptomycin mic results for study isolates in the absence or presence of albumin ranged from 0.125 to 4 and 1 to 8, respectively. both daptomycin regimens achieved greater than 99.9% kill by 8 h and demonstrated greater bacterial reduction than vancomycin against all tested isolates at 24, 48, and 72 h (p < 0.05). undetectable limits of bacterial quantification was achieved and maintained by 8 mg/kg/day against mrsa-494 and 67, gisa-992, and vref-590 for the study duration. although slight regrowth was noted only for 6 mg/kg/day against mrsa-67, 99.9% kill was maintained throughout  the study period without development of resistance. pharmacodynamic profiles and  drug exposure of daptomycin at 6 mg/kg/day corresponds to previously reported auc/mic requirements. these results suggest that 6 and 8 mg/kg/day of daptomycin  represent potential regimens for further clinical evaluation in drug-resistant gram-positive endocarditis.

TI  == piperacillin-tazobactam versus ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin in the treatment of infective episodes after liver transplantation.
AB  == an optimum antimicrobial regimen for bacterial infection after orthotopic liver transplantation has not been identified. in this prospective 4 year study of patients undergoing liver transplantation, patients were randomized to receive either piperacillin-tazobactam (112 patient episodes) or ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin (105 patient episodes) for empirical treatment of infective episodes  in the first 3 months after transplant. metronidazole was added to the ciprofloxacin-amoxicillin regimen where anaerobic infection was suspected. patient groups were comparable with respect to clinical, biochemical and haematological parameters. at the 72 h primary efficacy end-point, the overall response rate for the intention-to-treat group was 74/112 (66.1%) for piperacillin-tazobactam and 63/105 (60.0%) for ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin (p=0.399); the corresponding figures for the per-protocol (pp) group were 73/82 (89.0%) (piperacillin-tazobactam) and 61/80 (76.3%) (ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin) (p=0.038). at the end-of-study assessment, 58.9% of episodes in the  piperacillin-tazobactam group had a successful clinical outcome, compared with 50.5% in the ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin group (p=0.222); the corresponding figures for the pp group were 83.5% (piperacillin-tazobactam) and 68.8% (ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin) (p=0.038). staphylococci and aerobic gram-negative bacilli were the predominant pathogens in both groups. bacteria resistant to the study drugs were encountered, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and multiply-resistant klebsiella spp. empirical monotherapy with piperacillin-tazobactam is an effective treatment for infective episodes in liver transplant patients.

TI  == the screening of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria and their application to inactivating psychrotrophic food-borne pathogens.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various food samples and evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production. cells suspended in 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose plus 0.5% (wt/vol) lactate (ph 7.0) were incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees c under  aeration. among 193 strains, 27 strains accumulated 201-300 ppm h2o2, and 4 strains accumulated more than 301 ppm h2o2 in the cell suspensions. among the 9 high-level h2o2-producing strains, 8 strains were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the cell-free filtrate from lc. lactis subsp. lactis ai 62, which contained approximately 350 ppm h2o2, was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, listeria ivanovii, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, and aeromonas hydrophila. after 1 h incubation at 30 degrees c in the cell-free filtrate, the initial viable cell counts of the target bacteria (5.53-6.00 log cfu/ml) were reduced by 0.12-5.00 log units, except in the case of enterococci. the sensitivity varied with the bacterial species and ph. the enterococci were resistant to the treatment. our results show that h2o2 accumulated by lactic acid bacteria in a cell suspension is very effective in reducing the viable cell count of food-borne pathogens.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == the effect of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on indigenous bacterial flora in human  skin grafts.
AB  == allogeneic skin transplants require intensive immunosuppressive therapy. treatment protocols used for parenchymal organ grafts are not satisfactory to prevent skin graft rejection. another factor responsible for the destruction of allogeneic skin transplants is bacterial inflammation. temporary ischemia and the allogeneic reaction in transplanted skin cause increased permeability of the epidermis and the dermal capillaries, making skin grafts vulnerable to bacterial  penetration. moreover, immunosuppressive therapy compromises the host immune response. the present study assessed the effects of immunosuppression by cyclosporine (csa) or tacrolimus (tac) on the indigenous bacterial flora of transplanted human skin. we found that a 6-day course of treatment with csa or tac was followed by an increased prevalence of bacterial isolates, mostly evidenced by a change in the spectrum of graft bacterial flora from staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci toward more pathogenic strains such as escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, micrococcus, and pseudomonas. the mouse skin adjacent to the graft remained sterile, precluding the possibility of graft contamination with mouse flora.

TI  == a standardized test to assess the impact of different organic challenges on the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics.
AB  == this paper presents a suggestion for determining the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics in a phase 2/step 1 assay. emphasis is placed on specific organic challenges to evaluate the efficacy of antiseptics used to rinse the oral cavity, mucous membranes, or wounds for either prophylactic or therapeutic reasons. basic data are given concerning ready-to-use products based on poly(1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone-)iodine-complex (pvp-iodine), chlorhexidine, octenidine, or cetylpyridinium chloride. hydrogen peroxide (3.0%) was included to assess a product with known limited efficacy only. using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, and candida albicans, a 10(5)-fold reduction can be achieved in 10 min without interfering substances. in the presence of 10% albumin, 10% sheep blood, or 1% mucin, a 10(3)-fold reduction is yielded using products based on pvp-iodine, octenidine, or chlorhexidine. the combination of 4.5% albumin, 4.5% sheep blood, and 1% mucin was the most difficult organic challenge and only the products based on pvp-iodine, octenidine, or chlorhexidine remained active. the cetylpyridinium-based product and hydrogen peroxide were less effective. based on these data, a proposal for a phase 2/step 1 assay for antiseptics is presented to promote the standardization efforts.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive organisms in the intensive care unit.
AB  == purpose of review: the epidemiology of gram-positive pathogens in the intensive care unit are reviewed, recent trends in antimicrobial resistance among these organisms are discussed, and the significance of these data with respect to treatment are considered. recent findings: results of surveillance studies published in 2001 and 2002 have demonstrated that gram-positive organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci are among the most common bacteria infecting patients in intensive care units. furthermore, these organisms are becoming increasingly resistant to available antimicrobial agents, and 2002 has ushered in worrisome developments such as the  appearance of vancomycin-resistant s. aureus. community-acquired methicillin-resistant s. aureus and the rise in incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci are other problems of great concern. novel antibiotics such as quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid have activity against these agents, but resistance may develop to these agents as well. studies have shown that infections caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms may be associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs. exposure to antibiotics is a major risk factor for producing antibiotic resistance in patients, and methods to limit the spread of these organisms include restriction of antibiotic use, infection control, surveillance programs, and isolation procedures. summary: an awareness of the prevalence and patterns of resistance among gram-positive nosocomial pathogens is vital for the appropriate treatment of hospitalized patients. in addition, efforts must be made to minimize the selection and spread of these organisms.

TI  == prepared endotracheal tubes: are they a potential source for pathogenic microorganisms?
AB  == prepared endotracheal tubes (petts) are frequently used for unanticipated difficult intubation, but their storage time is highly variable and institution-dependent. we sought to determine first, if open, unused petts are a  potential source of pathogenic microorganisms, and second, if petts can provide a medium for bacterial survival after deliberate contamination. a stylet was inserted into a 7-mm ett, and this system was ethylene oxide sterilized. the petts were placed in 20 different locations and sampled 8 times in a 4-wk period. growth was determined after 48-h incubation, and the microorganism was identified. in phase 2, the pett (n = 40) was swabbed with a fresh suspension of  h. influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, or a negative control. nonvirulent bacteria were cultured from 13 of 160 (8.1%) samples and from 15 of 320 (4.7%) samples in phases 1 and 2, respectively. no pett grew the same bacteria more than once. in phase 2, after 24 h, only e. faecium was recovered. based on this study, the pathogenic potential of petts is  very small, and they can be safely used for up to 1 mo. this practice could translate to significant cost reduction for operating room budgets. implications: prepared endotracheal tubes (petts) are back-up airway equipment to be used in the case of a difficult intubation. a short pett shelf life because of unknown safe storage time results in significant budget costs. this blinded, controlled study examined the pathogenic potential of petts in the operating room environment.

TI  == coexistence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococcus aureus in the  intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients.
AB  == the potential for transfer of vancomycin-resistance genes from enterococci to staphylococcus aureus exists when these organisms share an ecologic niche. we performed an 8-month prospective study to determine the frequency at which s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) coexist in the intestinal tracts of vre-colonized patients and evaluated whether antianaerobic antibiotic therapy promoted increased density of s. aureus colonization. of 37 patients colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, 23 (62%) had s. aureus  recovered from stool specimens and 20 (87%) had methicillin-resistant strains. there was no significant difference in the mean density (+/- standard deviation)  of s. aureus during versus > or =1 month after discontinuation of antianaerobic antibiotic therapy (5.1+/-1.5 vs. 4.7+/-1.6 log10 colony-forming units per gram of stool; p=.34). no s. aureus isolates were resistant to vancomycin. s. aureus and vre often coexist in the intestinal tract, providing a potential reservoir for the emergence of vancomycin-resistant s. aureus isolates.

TI  == role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of gram-positive nosocomial infections in haematological or oncological patients.
AB  == gram-positive pathogens, primarily staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci, are now the predominant causes of infection in neutropenic haematology/oncology patients, but are often resistant to multiple antibiotics. glycopeptides have been the only alternative antibiotic treatments for multidrug-resistant gram-positive infections to date. however, glycopeptides are not always effective or well tolerated, and can produce nephrotoxic or ototoxic effects. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a recently introduced streptogramin antibiotic that  is active in vitro against most of the major gram-positive pathogens causing infection in neutropenic patients. recent studies of the in vitro susceptibility  of clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens to quinupristin/dalfopristin are  summarized. pre-clinical and clinical studies of the efficacy and safety of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of gram-positive infections are reviewed. quinupristin/dalfopristin is active in vitro against the vast majority  of recent isolates of relevant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, but excluding enterococcus faecalis. pre-clinical and clinical data indicate the efficacy of quinupristin/dalfopristin in infections caused by these organisms, including bacteraemia and catheter-related infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin is not associated with nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a potential alternative to glycopeptides in haematology or oncology patients with multidrug-resistant gram-positive infections, especially those who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of, glycopeptides.

AB  == sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of lactobacillus helveticus pr4. peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. the fractions which showed the highest angiotensin i-converting-enzyme (ace)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and edman degradation analyses. various ace-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(s1)-casein (alpha(s1)-cn) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-cn f58-76; ovine alpha(s1)-cn f1-6 and alpha(s2)-cn f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-cn f58-65  and alpha(s2)-cn f182-187; buffalo beta-cn f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-cn. a mixture of peptides with a c-terminal sequence, pro-gly-pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. the highest ace-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ace inhibitor (s)-n-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). several of the above sequences had features in  common with other ace-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml). some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ace-inhibitory activity and ic(50)s were confirmed. an antibacterial peptide corresponding to beta-cn f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. it showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as enterococcus faecium, bacillus megaterium, escherichia coli, listeria innocua, salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and staphylococcus aureus. the mic for e. coli f19 was ca. 50 micro g/ml. once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of l. helveticus pr4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.

TI  == discovery of a small molecule that inhibits cell division by blocking ftsz, a novel therapeutic target of antibiotics.
AB  == the emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major health problem and, therefore, it is critical to develop new antibiotics with novel modes of action. ftsz, a tubulin-like gtpase, plays an essential role in bacterial cell division, and its homologs are present in almost all eubacteria and archaea. during cell division, ftsz forms polymers in the presence of gtp that recruit other division proteins to make the cell division apparatus. therefore, inhibition of ftsz polymerization will prevent cells from dividing, leading to cell death. using a fluorescent ftsz polymerization assay, the screening of >100,000 extracts of microbial fermentation broths and plants followed by fractionation led to the identification of viriditoxin, which blocked ftsz polymerization with an ic50 of 8.2 microg/ml and concomitant gtpase inhibition with an ic50 of 7.0 microg/ml. that the mode of antibacterial action of viriditoxin is via inhibition of ftsz was confirmed by the observation of its effects on cell morphology, macromolecular synthesis, dna-damage response, and increased minimum inhibitory concentration as a result of an increase in the expression of the ftsz protein. viriditoxin exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, without affecting the viability of eukaryotic cells.

TI  == many chemokines including ccl20/mip-3alpha display antimicrobial activity.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that beta-defensins exhibit chemotactic activity by sharing the chemokine receptor ccr6 with the cc chemokine ligand ccl20/macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha (mip-3alpha). structural analysis of ccl20/mip-3alpha revealed that most of the positively charged residues are concentrated at one area of its topological surface, a characteristic considered  to be important for the antimicrobial activity of defensins. here, we report that similar to defensins, ccl20/mip-3alpha has antimicrobial effects on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. additionally,  by screening a total of 30 human chemokines, we have identified an additional 17  human chemokines, which exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro. collectively, about two-thirds of the chemokines investigated so far has the capacity to kill microorganisms in vitro, suggesting that antimicrobial activity may be another host-defense function for certain chemokines. comparison of the structural characteristics between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial chemokines suggests that topological formation of a large, positively charged electrostatic patch on  the surface of the molecule is likely to be a common structural feature of antimicrobial chemokines.

TI  == antimicrobial characterization of human beta-defensin 3 derivatives.
AB  == human beta-defensin 3 (hbd3) is a highly basic 45-amino-acid protein that acts both as an antimicrobial agent and as a chemoattractant molecule. although the nature of its antimicrobial activity is largely electrostatic, the importance of  the molecular structure on this activity is poorly understood. two isoforms of hbd3 were synthesized: the first with native disulfide linkages and the second with nonnative linkages. in a third synthetic peptide, all cysteine residues were replaced with alpha-aminobutyric acid, creating a completely linear peptide. a series of six small, linear peptides corresponding to regions of hbd3 with net charges ranging from +4 to +8 (at ph 7) and lengths ranging from 9 to 20 amino acids were also synthesized. the linear full-length peptide showed the highest microbicidal activity against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, while all three full-length forms showed equal activity against candida albicans. the linear peptide also showed high activity against enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. peptides corresponding to the c terminus showed higher activities when tested against e. coli, with the most active peptides being the most basic. however, only the peptide corresponding to the n terminus of hbd3 showed any activity against s. aureus and c. albicans. further, n-terminal deletion mutants of native hbd3 showed diminished activities against s. aureus. thus, the antimicrobial properties of hbd3 derivatives are determined by both charge and structure.

AB  == objective: to describe the pharmacodynamic profile of daptomycin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci species based  on bacterial density in an immunocompromised mouse thigh infection model. materials and methods: the pharmacodynamic (pd) profile of daptomycin was determined against two mrsa, one vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and one vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis using the immunocompromised murine thigh model. efficacy was assessed by the change in log10 cfu in thighs after 24 h of drug treatment. results: daptomycin produced a maximal kill of 4.5-5 log10 cfu against the mrsa and 1.5-2 log10 for the enterococcus species. auc/mic was the most predictive of the pd parameters. utilizing mics determined in serum or broth in the calculation of the pd parameters had minimal effect on this correlation. aucfree/micbroth required for static effects with mrsa and enterococcus species were 12-36 and 5-13, whereas 99% of maximal kill was achieved at ratios of 171-442 and 38-157, respectively. conclusions: these data reveal the potent in vivo bactericidal activity of daptomycin against mrsa and enterococcus species using clinically achievable drug exposures (dose 4-6 mg/kg per day) currently under investigation in man.

TI  == nosocomial bloodstream infections in pediatric patients in united states hospitals: epidemiology, clinical features and susceptibilities.
AB  == background: we identified the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of nosocomial bloodstream isolates in pediatric patients in the  us prospective surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals during a 6-year period [surveillance and control of pathogens of epidemiologic importance (scope)] detected 22 609 bloodstream infections, of which 3432 occurred in patients < or =16 years of age. results: gram-positive organisms accounted for 65% of cases, gram-negative organisms accounted for 24% of cases and 11% were caused by fungi. the overall crude mortality was 14% (475 of 3432) but notably higher for infections caused by candida spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa, 20 and 29%, respectively. the most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (43%), enterococci, staphylococcus aureus and candida spp. (each, 9%). the mean interval between admission and infection averaged 21 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 25 days for s. aureus and  candida spp., 32 days for klebsiella spp. and 34 days for enterococcus spp. the proportion of methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased from 10% in 1995 to 29% in 2001. vancomycin-resistance was seen in 1% of enterococcus faecalis and in 11% of enterococcus faecium isolates. conclusion: nosocomial bsi occurred predominantly in very young and/or critically ill children. gram-positive pathogens predominated across all ages, and increasing antimicrobial resistance was observed in pediatric patients.

TI  == disinfection of surfaces by photocatalytic oxidation with titanium dioxide and uva light.
AB  == particularly in microbiological laboratories and areas in intensive medical use,  regular and thorough disinfection of surfaces is required in order to reduce the  numbers of bacteria and to prevent bacterial transmission. the conventional methods of disinfection with wiping are not effective in the longer term, cannot  be standardized, are time- and staff-intensive and use aggressive chemicals. disinfection with hard ultraviolet c (uvc) light is usually not satisfactory, as  the depth of penetration is inadequate and there are occupational medicine risks. photocatalytic oxidation on surfaces coated with titanium dioxide (tio2) might offer a possible alternative. in the presence of water and oxygen, highly reactive oh-radicals are generated by tio2 and mild ultraviolet a (uva). these radicals are able to destroy bacteria, and may therefore be effective in reducing bacterial contamination. direct irradiation with uvc however can produce areas of shadow in which bacteria are not inactivated. using targeted light guidance and a light-guiding sheet (out of a uva-transmittant, plexiglas, for example), as in the method described in the present study, bacterial inactivation over the entire area is possible. the effectiveness of the method was demonstrated using bacteria relevant to hygiene such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. for these bacteria, a reduction efficiency (re) more than 6log10 steps in 60 min was observed. using candida albicans, a re of 2log10 steps in 60 min was seen. light and scanning electron microscopic examinations suggest that the germ destruction achieved takes place through direct damage to cell walls caused by oh-radicals.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == a comparison of the antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram-positive cocci isolated from community-private and university-affiliated hospitals from puerto rico.
AB  == the antimicrobial resistance patterns of 2,462 selected gram-positive cocci obtained from three community-private hospitals (cph) and three university-affiliated hospitals (uah) were evaluated utilizing the institutions'  antimicrobial susceptibility reports for the year 2000. the objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the in vitro resistance to selected standard antibiotics of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates, and 2) to compare the antimicrobial resistance patterns between community-private (cph) and university-affiliated hospitals (uah). staphylococcus aureus was the most common  gram-positive isolated organism in cph (63.3%) followed by e. faecalis (31.0%). in uah, the most prevalent cocci were e. faecalis (51.7%) followed by s. aureus (43.9%). enterococcus faecium represented 2.3% and 4.4% of cph and uah isolates,  respectively. streptococcus pneumoniae represented 3.4% of the total gram-positive isolates from cph, no s. pneumoniae was reported in uah. the antimicrobial susceptibility results showed that for staphylococcus aureus there  was a statistically significant higher resistance to methicillin and thrimethoprim sulfamethoxazole in uah, while resistance to erythromycin was significantly higher in cph. there was no difference in the resistance of s. aureus to other antimicrobial agents between hospitals groups. a statistically significant resistant to vancomycin was found between enterococcal isolates from  uah (43%) and cph (12.7%). high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was observed among uah enterococcal isolates with e. faecium showing a higher resistance than e. faecalis, no data for hlar in cph could be obtained. for pneumococci 46% of cph isolates were resistant to penicillin. in summary, there are important differences in the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance between  the gram-positive bacteria isolated from community and teaching hospitals.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria from icu patients in uk hospitals to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == microbiologists in 25 sentinel laboratories were each asked to refer up to 100 clinically-significant gram-positive bacteria isolated from consecutive intensive care unit (icu) patients. a total of 1595 isolates were collected from patients in 23 hospitals; these included staphylococcus aureus (47.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (30.6%), enterococci (14.3%), pneumococci (2.8%) and other streptococci (3.5%). a few coryneforms, other bacilli and a nocardia sp. were also collected. rates of oxacillin resistance among s. aureus and cns isolates were 59.3 and 78.5%, respectively. vancomycin-resistant s. aureus were not detected, although two isolates (0.3%) were resistant to teicoplanin [minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) 8 mg/l]. in contrast, 13.7% of cns were teicoplanin resistant (mics 8-32 mg/l) and 1.2% were resistant to vancomycin. among the enterococci, 72.5% were enterococcus faecalis and 24.5% were enterococcus faecium, the remainder including isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus or enterococcus gallinarum. eighteen percent of e. faecium isolates were vancomycin-resistant, compared with only 3% of e. faecalis isolates. rates of high-level gentamicin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium were 40 and 25%, respectively. nine percent of pneumococci and streptococci were resistant to penicillin, with 7 and 11%, respectively, resistant to erythromycin. none of the  isolates showed resistance to linezolid, with the mics for the entire study population falling in the range of 0.5-4 mg/l.

TI  == optimization of computer software settings improves accuracy of pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis macrorestriction fragment pattern analysis.
AB  == computer-assisted analysis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) libraries can facilitate comparisons of fragment patterns present on multiple gels. we evaluated the ability of the advanced analysis (version 4.01) and database (version 1.12) modules of the phoretix gel analysis software package (nonlinear usa, inc., durham, n.c.) to accurately match dna fragment patterns. two gels containing 38 lanes of smai-digested enterococcus faecalis og1rf dna were analyzed to assess the impact of (i) varying the lane position of the standards,  (ii) using gel plugs made at different times, and (iii) normalizing the fragment  patterns by using molecular weight (mw) algorithms versus retardation factor (r(f)) algorithms. two sets of pfge libraries (one containing smai restriction patterns from 62 enterococcus faecium isolates and the other containing smai restriction patterns of 89 staphylococcus aureus isolates) were analyzed to assess the impact of varying the matching tolerance algorithm (designated as the  vector box setting [vbs]) in the phoretix software. varying the lane position of  standards on a gel and using gel plugs made on different days resulted in different vbss, although it was not possible to judge whether those differences were statistically significant. normalization of e. faecalis og1rf fragment patterns by r(f) and mw methodology yielded no statistically significant differences in variability between the same fragment on different lanes. suboptimal vbss decreased the specificity with which related isolates were grouped together in dendrograms. the optimal vbs for analysis of pfge fragment patterns from e. faecalis isolates differed from that for s. aureus isolates and  sometimes was not that recommended by the manufacturer. thus, computer-assisted analysis of pfge patterns seemed to compensate for the intra- and intergel variation evaluated in the present study, and optimizing the software for the species to be tested was a critical preliminary step before further pfge library  analysis.

TI  == in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
AB  == piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive,  clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised  disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp.,  but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in animals.
AB  == there is currently no systematic surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic resistance in australian animals. registration of antibiotics for use in animals  is tightly controlled and has been very conservative. fluoroquinolones have not been registered for use in food producing animals and other products have been removed from the market because of human health concerns. in the late 1970s, the  animal health committee coordinated a survey of resistance in salmonella and escherichia coli isolates from cattle, pigs and poultry and in bovine staphylococcus aureus. some additional information is available from published case reports. in samples collected prior to the withdrawal of avoparcin from the  market, no vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis were detected in samples collected from pigs, whereas some vana enterococci, including e. faecium and e. faecalis, were found in chickens. no vanb enterococci were detected in either species. virginiamycin resistance was common in both pig  and poultry isolates. multiple resistance was common in e. coli and salmonellae isolates. no fluoroquinolone resistance was found in salmonellae, e. coli or campylobacter. beta-lactamase production is common in isolates from bovine mastitis, but no methicillin resistance has been detected. however, methicillin resistance has been reported in canine isolates of staphylococcus intermedius and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli has been found in dogs.

TI  == persistent silver disinfectant for the environmental control of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: contaminated surfaces can act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and potentially exacerbate the risk of infection. surface disinfection and decontamination provide temporary amelioration against bacterial colonization. disinfected surfaces eventually become contaminated, thus, mitigating the benefit of the initial disinfection. it is hypothesized that to improve on the current state of the art, a disinfectant should not only immediately disinfect a surface but also provide persistent antimicrobial action  after the product has been applied. we describe here a silver-based disinfectant  technology designed to provide long-lasting sanitization and disinfection to treated surfaces as evaluated on hard surfaces after repeated environmental insults. methods: a comparative evaluation of 6 disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity after water rinsing was performed. log reduction  of bacterial populations on disinfectant-treated substrates were measured after 30 minutes to 8 hours of exposure and compared with an untreated control. in a similar study, the residual antimicrobial activity of a silver disinfectant was evaluated against antibiotic- and biocide-resistant bacteria also after water rinsing. further, residual antimicrobial activity of the silver disinfectant was  measured after 5 cycles of rinsing, abrasion, and contamination against representative household and nosocomial pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, or salmonella choleraesuis) after 10-minute exposure times. results: in the comparative assay, only the silver disinfectant and a persistent  quaternary ammonium compound disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity (> or =3.0 log(10) reduction to control) against s aureus whereas only the silver disinfectant demonstrated activity against pseudomonas. no residual activity (< or = 0.5 log reduction to untreated control) was observed for the other disinfectant products. the silver-based disinfectant also showed significant and equivalent efficacy against antibiotic- and silver-resistant bacteria. in addition, the silver disinfectant was able to achieve significant residual activity in 10 minutes against all organisms tested after 1, 3, and 5 cycles of water rinse, abrasion, and microbial contamination. conclusions: the findings show the ability of a new silver-based disinfectant to reduce bacterial  populations that contact treated surfaces within minutes, highlight the potential to interrupt cross-contamination from environmental surfaces, and reduce the risk of infection within the home and health care settings.

AB  == objectives: to estimate antibiotic resistance among bacterial strains isolated from patients with neonatal sepsis from january 1994 through december 1998, and to assess the predictive value of the checkerboard method for selecting treatment with combination antibiotic therapy in seriously ill patients. methods: the study of strain susceptibility was carried out by microdilution in broth, and the checkerboard method in broth trays was used to assess the efficacy of antibiotic  combination therapy. results: fifty per cent of the strains of coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. and 37% of s. aureus strains, which are the main pathogens involved in neonatal sepsis, were resistant to methycillin. of these strains, 94.5% were resistant to several antibiotics. four strains of coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. and one strain of enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin (minimal inhibitory concentration = 128 micro g/ml). we noted a high probability of clinical efficacy (p < 0.01) with antibiotic combinations having a synergistic effect in vitro, whereas antagonic reactions were seen in close association with a highly significant probability of clinical therapeutic failure. discussion: the main cause of neonatal sepsis in the neonatal intensive  care unit at "america arias" hospital in havana, cuba, were strains of staphylococcus resistant to methycillin and other antibiotics. in seriously ill patients (according to policy established at this institution), the first line of treatment is a combination of an aminoglycoside antibiotic and a beta-lactamic antibiotic. this study showed that the clinical efficacy of combination antibiotic therapy is not determined by the resistance pattern of the strain and  that good clinical results can be attained, in all likelihood, when a synergistic effect can be shown in vitro.

TI  == development of a thermally regulated broad-spectrum promoter system for use in pathogenic gram-positive species.
AB  == selectively regulating gene expression is an essential molecular tool that is lacking for many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. in this report, we describe the evaluation of a series of promoters regulated by the bacteriophage p1 temperature-sensitive c1 repressor in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. using the lacz gene to monitor gene expression, we examined the strength, basal expression, and induced expression of synthetic promoters carrying c1 operator sites. the promoters exhibited extremely low basal expression and, under inducing conditions, gave high levels of expression (100- to 1,000-fold induction). we demonstrate that the promoter system could be modulated by temperature and showed rapid induction and that the  mechanism of regulation occurred at the level of transcription. controlled expression with the same constructs was also demonstrated in the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli. however, low basal expression and the ability to achieve derepression were dependent on both the number of mismatches in the c1 operator sites and the promoter driving c1 expression. since the promoters were designed to contain conserved promoter elements from gram-positive species and were constructed in a broad-host-range plasmid, this system will provide a new opportunity for controlled gene expression in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == 6-anilinopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ones are novel dgtp analogues that inhibit the replication-specific enzyme dna polymerase iii (dna pol iii) of staphlococcus aureus and other gram-positive (gr+) bacteria. to enhance the potential of these  inhibitors as antimicrobial agents, a structure-activity relationship was developed involving substitutions at the 2, 4, and pyrazolo nh positions. all of  the new inhibitors were tested for their ability to inhibit s. aureus dna pol iii and the growth of several other gr+ bacteria in culture. 2-anilino groups with small hydrophobic groups in the meta or para position enhanced both antipolymerase and antimicrobial activity. 2-benzyl-substituted inhibitors were substantially less active. substitution in the 4-position by oxygen gave the optimal activity, whereas substitution at the pyrazolo nh was not tolerated. these pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives represent a novel class of antimicrobials with promising activities against gr+ bacteria.

TI  == baseline study to determine in vitro activities of daptomycin against gram-positive pathogens isolated in the united states in 2000-2001.
AB  == the activity of daptomycin was assessed by using 6,973 gram-positive bacteria isolated at 50 united states hospitals in 2000 and 2001. among the isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,163) collected, the rate of penicillin resistance was 16.1%; rates of oxacillin resistance among staphylococcus aureus isolates (n  = 1,018) and vancomycin resistance among enterococcus faecium isolates (n = 368)  were 30.0 and 59.5%, respectively. multidrug-resistant (mdr) phenotypes (isolates resistant to three or more different chemical classes of antimicrobial agents) accounted for 14.2% of s. pneumoniae isolates, 27.1% of s. aureus isolates, and 58.4% of e. faecium isolates. for all gram-positive species tested, mics at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)s) and mic ranges for directed-spectrum agents (daptomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and linezolid) were identical or highly similar for isolates susceptible or resistant to other agents or mdr. daptomycin had a mic(90) of 0.12 micro g/ml for both penicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates of s. pneumoniae. against oxacillin-resistant s. aureus daptomycin had a mic(90) of 0.5 micro g/ml, and it  had a mic(90) of 4 micro g/ml against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant  e. faecium. the mic(90)s for daptomycin and other directed-spectrum agents were unaffected by the regional or anatomical origin of isolates or patient demographic parameters (patient age, gender, and inpatient or outpatient care). our results confirm the gram-positive spectrum of activity of daptomycin and that its activity is independent of susceptibility or resistance to commonly prescribed and tested antimicrobial agents. this study may serve as a baseline to monitor future changes in the susceptibility of gram-positive species to daptomycin following its introduction into clinical use.

TI  == daptomycin dose-effect relationship against resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == daptomycin exhibits in vitro bactericidal activity against clinically significant gram-positive bacteria. we employed pharmacodynamic modeling to determine a once-daily dosing regimen of daptomycin that correlates to pharmacodynamic endpoints for different resistant gram-positive clinical strains. an in vitro pharmacodynamic model with an initial inoculum of 6 log(10) cfu/ml was used to simulate daptomycin regimens ranging in dose from 0 to 9 mg/kg of body weight/day, with corresponding exposures reflecting free-daptomycin concentrations in serum. bacterial density was profiled over 48 h for two methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa-67 and -r515), two glycopeptide intermediate-resistant s. aureus (gisa-992 and -147398), and two vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref-12366 and -sf12047) strains. a sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the effective dose required to achieve 50% (ed(50)) and 80% (ed(80)) bacterial density reduction at 48 h. daptomycin mics for study isolates ranged from 0.125 to 4 micro g/ml. model fitting resulted in an r(2) of >0.80 for all tested isolates. control growths at  48 h ranged from 7.3 to 8.5 log(10) cfu/ml. sigmoid relationships were not superimposable between categorical resistant species: ed(50) and ed(80) values were 1.9 and 3.1, 4.2 and 5.6, and 5.4 and 6.8 mg/kg for mrsa, gisa, and vref isolates, respectively. doses required to achieve ed(50) and ed(80) values correlated with mic differences between tested organisms. corresponding area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h/mic exposure ratios demonstrated a wide range of ed(80) values among the tested isolates. doses ranging between 3 and 7 mg/kg produced significant bactericidal activity (ed(80)) against these multidrug-resistant s. aureus and e. faecium isolates.

TI  == in vitro activity of gatifloxacin alone and in combination with cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin and gentamicin against multidrug-resistant organisms.
AB  == objectives: to study the in vitro interaction of gatifloxacin in combination with gentamicin and with the beta-lactams cefepime, meropenem and piperacillin against clinical isolates of stenotrophomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). methods: the activity of each drug alone was determined by an agar dilution method. chequerboard synergy testing was then performed against all the isolates. time-kill assays were done on selected isolates to assess correlation with the chequerboard results. results: synergy was demonstrated with the following combinations at achievable serum concentrations: gatifloxacin/piperacillin for 80% and gatifloxacin/cefepime for 60% of s. maltophilia; gatifloxacin/gentamicin for 60%, and gatifloxacin/cefepime for 50% of esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, and in all drug combinations for 50-70% of p. aeruginosa. indifference was noted for the majority of b. cepacia and vre isolates. antagonism at therapeutic serum levels was observed with gatifloxacin/piperacillin against a single isolate of b. cepacia. no distinct trend in drug interaction was seen with the different drug combinations against mrsa. time-kill analyses against selected isolates confirmed the synergic activity of the following drug combinations seen in the chequerboard assays: gatifloxacin/cefepime and gatifloxacin/piperacillin against p. aeruginosa, gatifloxacin/gentamicin against b. cepacia, and gatifloxacin/gentamicin and gatifloxacin/meropenem against esbl-producing k. pneumoniae. conclusions: gatifloxacin was synergic with the beta-lactams piperacillin, cefepime and meropenem, and with gentamicin against some drug-resistant pathogens. some of the time-kill analyses against p. aeruginosa, b. cepacia and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae were in accordance with chequerboard  results. time-kill analyses against s. maltophilia did not confirm the synergy seen in chequerboard testing.

TI  == clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium exhibit strain-specific collagen binding mediated by acm, a new member of the mscramm family.
AB  == a collagen-binding adhesin of enterococcus faecium, acm, was identified. acm shows 62% similarity to the staphylococcus aureus collagen adhesin cna over the entire protein and is more similar to cna (60% and 75% similarity with cna a and  b domains respectively) than to the enterococcus faecalis collagen-binding adhesin, ace, which shares homology with acm only in the a domain. despite the detection of acm in 32 out of 32 e. faecium isolates, only 11 of these (all clinical isolates, including four vancomycin-resistant endocarditis isolates and  seven other isolates) exhibited binding to collagen type i (ci). although acm from three ci-binding vancomycin-resistant e. faecium clinical isolates showed 100% identity, analysis of acm genes and their promoter regions from six non-ci-binding strains identified deletions or mutations that introduced stop codons and/or is elements within the gene or the promoter region in five out of six strains, suggesting that the presence of an intact functional acm gene is necessary for binding of e. faecium strains to ci. recombinant acm a domain showed specific and concentration-dependent binding to collagen, and this protein competed with e. faecium binding to immobilized ci. consistent with the adherence phenotype and sequence data, probing with acm-specific iggs purified from anti-recombinant acm a polyclonal rabbit serum confirmed the surface expression of acm in three out of three collagen-binding clinical isolates of e. faecium tested, but in none of the strains with a non-functional pseudo acm gene. introduction of a functional acm gene into two non-ci-binding natural acm mutant  strains conferred a ci-binding phenotype, further confirming that native acm is sufficient for the binding of e. faecium to ci. these results demonstrate that acm, which encodes a potential virulence factor, is functional only in certain infection-derived clinical isolates of e. faecium, and suggest that acm is the primary adhesin responsible for the ability of e. faecium to bind collagen.

TI  == activity of daptomycin against susceptible and multidrug-resistant gram-positive  pathogens collected in the secure study (europe) during 2000-2001.
AB  == antibiotic resistance was prevalent in gram-positive pathogens collected from 40  sites in 15 european countries during 2000-2001. among staphylococcus aureus, 27.3% of all isolates submitted were resistant to oxacillin and ranged from 0% of isolates from the netherlands to 36.9% of isolates from portugal. the overall prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium was 25.1%, with italy submitting the largest percentage of resistant isolates (60.6%). for streptococcus pneumoniae, 9.4% of all isolates collected were resistant to penicillin with variation by country from 0% in the netherlands to 20.7% in portugal. multidrug resistance (mdr), defined as concurrent resistance to three or more antimicrobials of different chemical classes, was observed in 24.6% of s. aureus, 19.6% of e. faecium and 3.6% of s. pneumoniae. the directed spectrum agents daptomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active in vitro against all isolates regardless of their resistance to other agents. daptomycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin (mic(90)s 0.5 mg/l) were equally active against oxacillin-resistant s. aureus compared with linezolid (mic(90) 2 mg/l). the activities of daptomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid were not affected by resistance to vancomycin in e. faecium (mic(90)s of 4, 2 and 2 mg/l,  respectively). daptomycin was more active against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic(90) 0.25 mg/l) than was quinupristin-dalfopristin (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) or linezolid (mic(90) 2 mg/l). daptomycin was highly active against clinically important gram-positive pathogens, including those that were multiply  resistant to currently available agents. the results of this study provide a benchmark of the activity of daptomycin against contemporary european isolates and will serve as a baseline to monitor future changes in the susceptibility of these organisms to daptomycin.

AB  == we previously reported a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in the present study, we purified an anti-mrsa substance (mc21-a) from the methanol extract of the cells of p. phenolica o-bc30(t) and analyzed its chemical structure. mc21-a was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. its anti-mrsa activity against 10 clinical isolates of mrsa was comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a mics, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin mics, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). this substance was also high active against enterococcus serolicida, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis but was  less active against streptococcus spp. a time-kill study also demonstrated that mc21-a was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. the postantibiotic effect (pae) of mc21-a against a clinical mrsa isolate, strain e 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a paes,  1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin paes, 0.84 to 1.43 h). however, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse mrsa cells. this substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. a sytox green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of mrsa as its mode of action. when its activities against a hypersensitive escherichia coli mutant (ko 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, mc21-a exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. furthermore, mc21-a was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. these results suggest that mc21-a might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-mrsa substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.

AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

AB  == the pharmacology, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse effects of linezolid are reviewed. linezolid, the only oxazolidinone  antimicrobial approved for use in the united states, has significant activity against gram-positive bacteria, including penicillin-, cephalosporin-, and vancomycin-resistant species. linezolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis via  binding to the 50s ribosomal subunit to prevent translation. the drug lacks cross-resistance with other antimicrobials. linezolid is primarily excreted renally as unchanged drug. the measured plasma half-life of four to five hours permits twice-daily administration for all indicated infections. virtually complete oral bioavailability allows for 1:1 conversion between the intravenous and oral dosage forms. controlled comparative clinical trials demonstrate that linezolid is effective in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections, nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia, and skin and skin-structure infections due to susceptible organisms. the recommended dosage is 600 mg i.v. or p.o. twice daily for all indications except uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections (400 mg twice daily); adjustments for mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment are not necessary. clinically important interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors have not been observed. reversible myelosuppression  has been observed in a few patients. linezolid has gram-positive activity comparable to that of vancomycin, is effective in a variety of infections, and is well tolerated, with diarrhea, headache, and nausea being the most frequently reported adverse effects. linezolid provides a reasonable therapeutic alternative for patients with vancomycin-resistant e. faecium infections and patients infected with mrsa who cannot tolerate vancomycin.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of naphthazarins from arnebia euchroma.
AB  == bioassay-directed fractionation of extract of arnebia euchroma led to the isolation of alkannin (1), shikonin (2), and their derivatives (3-8) as the active principles against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and  vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). the stereochemistry of alpha-methylbutyryl alkannin (8) is revealed for the first time, and the antimicrobial activity of 8 was compared with its corresponding diastereomer (9). the derivatives 3-9 showed stronger anti-mrsa activity [minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranged from 1.56 to 3.13 microg/ml] than alkannin or shikonin (mic = 6.25 microg/ml). anti-mrsa activity of derivatives was bactericidal with minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc)/mic < or = 2. in a time-kill assay, the bactericidal activity against mrsa was achieved as rapidly as 2 h. the derivatives 3-9 were also active against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (f935) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (cku-17) with mics similar to those with mrsa. aromatic ester derivatives were also synthesized for antimicrobial activity comparison. none of these compounds were active against gram-negative bacteria tested. their cytotoxicity was also evaluated on selected cancer cell lines, and they expressed their activity in the range 0.6-5.4 microg/ml (cd(50)). our results indicate that the ester derivatives of alkannin are potential candidates of anti-mrsa and anti-vre agents with antitumor activity.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of tigecycline (gar-936) against enterococcus faecium and  staphylococcus aureus used alone and in combination.
AB  == study objective: to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of tigecycline, both alone and in combination with other antibiotics, against multidrug-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. design: in vitro study. setting: university laboratory. measurements and main results: tigecycline, both alone and in combination with other antimicrobial agents, was evaluated against two strains of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (vref), three glycopeptide-intermediately resistant s. aureus strains, and one methicillin-resistant s. aureus strain. tigecycline's activity was compared with  that of vancomycin, gentamicin, rifampin, and doxycycline, using time-kill studies and analysis of minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations. tigecycline also was evaluated in combination with vancomycin, gentamicin, rifampin, and doxycycline in time-kill studies. the number of log10 colony-forming units/ml at 24 hours was compared among treatment  groups and growth control by analysis of variance. all isolates were susceptible  to tigecycline, regardless of their susceptibilities to vancomycin or doxycycline. in time-kill studies, tigecycline significantly inhibited the bacterial inoculum of all isolates (p < 0.05). although none of the tigecycline combinations studied had enhanced killing activity against vref, when gentamicin  was combined with tigecycline, improved effects were found against both strains.  against three of the s. aureus strains tested, the combination of gentamicin and  tigecycline demonstrated enhanced or improved activity independently of each strain's susceptibility to gentamicin. conclusion: the multidrug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria tested, including doxycycline-resistant isolates, were susceptible to tigecycline. the combination of tigecycline and gentamicin may have improved or enhanced activity against strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and s. aureus.

TI  == chemistry and biology of the ramoplanin family of peptide antibiotics.
AB  == the peptide antibiotic ramoplanin factor a2 is a promising clinical candidate for treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections that are resistant to antibiotics such as glycopeptides, macrolides, and penicillins. since its discovery in 1984,  no clinical or laboratory-generated resistance to this antibiotic has been reported. the mechanism of action of ramoplanin involves sequestration of peptidoglycan biosynthesis lipid intermediates, thus physically occluding these substrates from proper utilization by the late-stage peptidoglycan biosynthesis enzymes murg and the transglycosylases (tgases). ramoplanin is structurally related to two cell wall active lipodepsipeptide antibiotics, janiemycin, and enduracidin, and is functionally related to members of the lantibiotic class of antimicrobial peptides (mersacidin, actagardine, nisin, and epidermin) and glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin). peptidomimetic chemotherapeutics derived from the ramoplanin sequence may find future use as antibiotics against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and related pathogens. here we review the chemistry and biology of the ramoplanins including its discovery, structure elucidation, biosynthesis, antimicrobial activity, mechanism of action, and total synthesis.

AB  == nocathiacin i (1) and nocathiacin iv (2) are novel indole-containing thiazolyl peptide antibiotics, which exhibit potent activity against key gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including multi drug-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecium. new nocathiacins 7-12 were prepared from 2 by a condensation with glycolaldehyde followed by tandem reductive amination of the 2-oxoethyl intermediate 4. the latter was formed via amadori rearrangement from initial 2-hydroxyethylideneamide 3. this transformation readily tolerates the complex architecture of nocathiacins and allows selective incorporation of water solubilizing groups to the primary amide  in 2 without protecting group manipulation.

TI  == different bacteriocin activities of streptococcus mutans reflect distinct phylogenetic lineages.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by mutans streptococci are known as mutacins. in this study 16 broadly active mutacin-producing streptococcus mutans strains from new zealand, north america and europe were classified into four groups (a-d) on the basis of differences in their activity in deferred antagonism tests against either the homologous producer strain (to test for presence of self-immunity) or  indicator strains staphylococcus aureus 46 and enterococcus faecium te1. two of the strains included in the study (ua140 and ua96) were representatives of the group i and ii mutacin producer strains previously described by caufield and co-workers. one of the new zealand isolates of group a (s. mutans strain n) appeared to produce inhibitory activity similar to that of the group i prototype  strain ua140. four other new zealand isolates of group b (s. mutans strains m19,  m34, b34 and d14) had mutacin ii-like activity. the group b mutacin producers differed from the group a mutacin producers in their additional activity against  staph. aureus 46. seven s. mutans strains (m46, b46, b57, m12, m28, b28 and 13m)  were distinguished from the group a and group b mutacin producers in that they inhibited e. faecium te1. these were called group c mutacin producers. strains h7 and h23 resembled the group c strains in their action on both indicator strains te1 and 46. however, these two strains failed to exhibit immunity to their own inhibitory products in the deferred antagonism test and were separately classified as group d mutacin producers. phylogenetic analysis of the strains by  several genotypic and phenotypic characteristics revealed that the mutacin groups were associated with distinct evolutionary lineages of s. mutans.

AB  == objective: nosocomial bloodstream infections have been extensively investigated,  but relatively few studies have specifically evaluated the epidemiology of intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections. the study objective was to define the incidence, risk factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections. design: population-based prospective cohort. setting: multidisciplinary intensive care units. patients: all calgary health region (population 930,000) adult patients admitted to multidisciplinary intensive care units (>/=48 hrs) from may 1, 1999, to april 30, 2000. interventions: blood sample analysis. measurements and results: there were  1,158 admission episodes in 1,017 patients; 37% involved females, and mean +/- sd age and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii scores were 59.6 +/- 18.7 yrs and 23.4 +/- 7.7, respectively. fifty-one patients developed intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections (first positive blood culture >/=48 hrs after intensive care unit admission) for an incidence of 4.4% and an incidence density of 5.2 per 1000 intensive care unit days. younger age (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.00, p =.01), longer intensive care unit length of stay (adjusted odds ratio, 4.74; 95% ci, 3.26-6.90, p <.001), and  lower hematocrit (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.00,  p =.04) were significant independent predictors of intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections, and these infections were associated with an increased intensive care unit length of stay of 2.86 days (95% confidence interval, 2.29-3.57, p <.001). staphylococcus aureus (27%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (14%), and enterococcus faecium (12%) were most commonly isolated.  four (8%) bloodstream infections involved antibiotic-resistant organisms, and ten (20%) were polymicrobial. in multivariate analysis, intensive care unit-acquired  bloodstream infection was associated with an increased intensive care unit mortality rate (adjusted odds ratio, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-4.00, p  = 0.04) but not overall hospital mortality rate. conclusions: one patient in 20 admitted to calgary health region intensive care units acquires bloodstream infection and suffers longer intensive care unit stay and increased mortality rates. in our region, multiple antibiotic-resistant organisms are uncommon causes of bloodstream infections, suggesting that it may be safe to use narrower spectrum empirical treatment regimens than current guidelines recommend.

TI  == [surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: vira study].
AB  == introduction: resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. the aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. material and methods: a total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in october 2001 were studied. these included 294 methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 96 enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli, 160 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 acinetobacter baumannii. sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. results: overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli and mrsa strains was 24% in both cases. the pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. most mrsa isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. all the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only 50% of a. baumannii strains were susceptible  to imipenem. conclusion: the results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as mrsa, cns, ampicillin-resistant  enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.

AB  == background: life-threatening infections with multiresistant gram-positive bacteria are increasing. treatment with quinupristin/dalfopristin (q-d) has turned out to be effective against such resistant pathogens. patients and methods: we report on treatment of six patients on dialysis (four with additional liver injury) and of one renal graft recipient with normal renal function who had severe infections caused by multiresistant staphylococus epidermidis (1/7), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (4/7) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (2/7). results: six out of seven patients were cured by therapy with q-d in adjusted doses lasting for 10 to 34 days. pharmacokinetics of q-d and its metabolites were determined and remained within the therapeutic range, despite a modest increase of all compounds at the presumed steady state. the concentrations of the metabolites of q-d were clearly lower than the parent drugs, including those of quinupristin-conjugated derivatives, which has not been reported previously. conclusion: these preliminary results suggest that: a) neither quinupristin nor dalfopristin or its metabolites accumulated despite the  long duration of treatment; b) no adjustment of the standard dosage regimen (three times 7.5 mg/kg/day) is necessary in end-stage renal disease.

TI  == design of non-cysteine-containing antimicrobial beta-hairpins: structure-activity relationship studies with linear protegrin-1 analogues.
AB  == protegrins are short, cationic peptides that display potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. pg-1, the first of the five natural analogues discovered, forms a rigid antiparallel two-stranded beta-sheet that is stabilized by two disulfide bonds. the two strands of the sheet are linked by a short two-residue loop segment. removal of the disulfide bridges (e.g., in cys --> ala analogues) is known to cause marked loss of antimicrobial activity. we have used basic principles of beta-hairpin design to develop linear analogues of pg-1 that lack cysteine but nevertheless display pg-1-like activity. our most potent reengineered molecules contain three essential design features: (i) the four cysteine residues of pg-1 are replaced by residues that have high propensity for  beta-strand conformation, (ii) d-proline is placed at the i + 1 position of the reverse turn to promote a type ii' beta-turn, and (iii) amino functionality is incorporated at the gamma-carbon of the d-proline residue to mimic the charge distribution of the natural beta-hairpin. structural studies revealed that the antimicrobial potency of the non-disulfide-bonded peptides can be correlated to the stability of the beta-hairpin conformations they adopt in aqueous solution. the presence of 150 mm nacl was found to have little effect on the antimicrobial  activity of pg-1, but one of our linear analogues loses some potency under these  high salt conditions. despite this discrepancy in salt sensitivity, nmr and cd data indicate that neither pg-1 nor our linear analogue experiences a significant decrease in beta-hairpin conformational stability in the presence of 150 mm nacl. thus, salt inactivation is not due to destabilization of the beta-hairpin conformation. furthermore, our results show that beta-sheet design principles can be used to replace conformation-stabilizing disulfide bridges with noncovalent conformation-stabilizing features.

TI  == [interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  meca, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. in relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsb, the most frequent mechanism  among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been recently described. in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage  of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because  of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vana is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.

TI  == strategies to control antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is becoming a worldwide concern. antibiotic resistance may  be caused by sporadic mutations, which are not important unless spread clonally.  clonal resistance may disseminate a highly resistant clone to widespread geographic areas. the most effective interventions to limit the clonal spread of  resistant organisms are effective infection control measures. hospital antibiotic formulary restriction is the only control measure with proven effectiveness to control resistance related to antibiotic use. hospital formularies should eliminate or restrict antibiotics with a high-resistance potential (eg, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem), and should be replaced with equivalent antibiotics with a low-resistance potential (eg, cefe-pime, levofloxacin, and meropenem). such low-resistance-potential antibiotics can either prevent or eliminate resistance problems associated with klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. high-resistance-potential antibiotics, particularly ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime, also may indirectly increase the prevalence of highly resistant organisms (eg, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [vre]). vancomycin use should be restricted, not because it increases enterococcal resistance per se, but because it selects out naturally resistant enterococcal strains (eg, enterococcus faecium that are vancomycin resistant). linezolid does not increase  the prevalence of vre. clinicians in the outpatient setting should also preferentially use oral antibiotics with a low-resistance potential (eg, clindamycin, metronidazole, doxycycline, minocycline, fluoroquinolones except ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and oral cephalosporins) in preference to their high-resistance-potential counterparts. for antibiotic resistance control interventions to be effective, they must be applied simultaneously to all antibiotics with activity against the specific resistance pathogen at the hospital formulary level. multiple antibiotic substitutions are usually necessary to eradicate resistance problems caused by a particular pathogen. multiple drugs  of the same spectrum and low-resistance potential are necessary to eliminate resistance problems; single antibiotic substitutions are not effective.

TI  == the 2.4-a crystal structure of the penicillin-resistant penicillin-binding protein pbp5fm from enterococcus faecium in complex with benzylpenicillin.
AB  == penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) are membrane proteins involved in the final stages of peptidoglycan synthesis and represent the targets of beta-lactam antibiotics. enterococci are naturally resistant to these antibiotics because they produce a pbp, named pbp5fm in enterococcus faecium, with low-level affinity for beta-lactams. we report here the crystal structure of the acyl-enzyme complex of pbp5fm with benzylpenicillin at a resolution of 2.4 a. a characteristic of the active site, which distinguishes pbp5fm from other pbps of known structure, is the topology of the loop 451-465 defining the left edge of the cavity. the residue arg464, involved in a salt bridge with the residue asp481, confers a greater rigidity to the pbp5fm active site. in addition, the presence of the val465 residue, which points into the active site, reducing its accessibility, could account for the low affinity of pbp5fm for beta-lactam. this loop is common to pbps of low affinity, such as pbp2a from staphylococcus aureus and pbp3 from bacillus subtilis. moreover, the insertion of a serine after residue 466 in the most resistant strains underlines even more the determining role of this loop in  the recognition of the substrates.

AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == functional analysis of the lipoglycodepsipeptide antibiotic ramoplanin.
AB  == the peptide antibiotic ramoplanin is highly effective against several drug-resistant gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), two important opportunistic human pathogens. ramoplanin inhibits bacterial peptidoglycan (pg) biosynthesis by binding to lipid intermediates i and ii at a location different than the n-acyl-d-ala-d-ala dipeptide site targeted by vancomycin. lipid i/ii capture physically occludes these substrates from proper utilization by the late-stage pg biosynthesis enzymes murg and the transglycosylases. key structural features of ramoplanin responsible for antibiotic activity and pg molecular recognition have been discovered by antibiotic semisynthetic modification in conjunction with nmr analyses. these results help define a minimalist ramoplanin pharmacophore and introduce the possibility of generating ramoplanin-derived peptide or peptidomimetic antibiotics for use against vre, mrsa, and related pathogens.

TI  == effect of medium composition on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to mercuric chloride.
AB  == although there is considerable interest in identifying mercury-resistant bacteria, no standardized assay exists for this purpose. in this study, the effect of the composition of the medium on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to hgcl(2) was investigated. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of hgcl(2) for 52 streptococcal strains and the reproducibility of mic values for hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains was determined with 11 different media. addition of blood increased the mic values, and some media (tryptone soya  agar, with or without blood) could not discriminate between hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains. the proportion of streptococci that appeared to be resistant to hg was very high (>70%) on some media (mitis-salivarius, tryptone soya, columbia), but not on others (mueller-hinton, brain heart infusion, isosensitest). the mics of the control strains varied considerably on different testing occasions for tryptone soya agar (with and without blood), isosensitest agar, and columbia agar (with blood). mueller-hinton (without blood) appeared to  be the most suitable medium for isolating hg-resistant oral streptococci.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem against isolates from complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cutis) between 1988 and 2000. imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting gram-negative rods. resistant strains (mic>16 mg/l) were observed in staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), enterococcus faecalis (4%), enterococcus avium (8%), serratia marcescens (5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over  the period. resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. these results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.

TI  == in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and cefepime, alone and in combination with various antimicrobials, against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  == use of combinations of antimicrobials that together achieve synergistic activities against targeted microorganisms is one potential strategy for overcoming bacterial resistance. as the incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci increases, the importance of devising additional synergistic drug combinations for these bacteria is magnified. we evaluated a number of antimicrobial combinations, with a focus on quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d), cefepime, and linezolid, using a previously described in vitro pharmacodynamic model. the combination of q-d with either linezolid or vancomycin, as well as the combination of cefepime-vancomycin, resulted in enhanced killing (> or =2-log(10) increase in killing versus the most-active single agent) against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 494. an improved effect (<2 log(10) kill increase in kill) against mrsa 494 was noted for cefepime plus either q-d or linezolid, as well as linezolid-vancomycin. similar relationships were observed for a methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolate (isolate 1199). against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis r444, enhanced killing was achieved with the combination of cefepime-linezolid, while improvement was noted for vancomycin with either cefepime or linezolid. the combination of cefepime and vancomycin also achieved enhanced killing against a glycopeptide-intermediate-susceptible s. aureus isolate (isolate 992). the combination of linezolid and doxycycline achieved an enhanced effect against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vrefc) and e. faecium. q-d plus ampicillin or linezolid resulted in similar enhancement of activity against the vrefc isolate. the results of this study suggest a number of novel antimicrobial combinations that may be useful against staphylococci and enterococci. combination regimens including cefepime, q-d, and/or linezolid warrant further investigation for the treatment of refractive infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == the prevalence of strains of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (cn) staphylococci, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, cn staphylococci from 63 samples, e. coli from 49 samples, e. faecalis or e. faecium from 107 samples, and l. monocytogenes from two samples. bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (clt), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (cmp), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ery), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (str), tetracycline (ttc) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) characteristics (mic50, mic90, mic range) were determined for each microbial species. resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of  s. aureus, 40% of cn staphylococci, 73% of e. coli, 88% of e.faecalis, 55% of e.faecium, and one l. monocytogenes strain. most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to str, ttc, and ery (mic50 4 microg/ml). a high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. high resistance to clt was found in 11 strains of e. coli (mic 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to cmp (mic90 16 microg/ml) were detected. the highest numbers  of resistance phenotypes were found in e. coil (16) and cn staphylococci (12). eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria  (e. coli, e. faecalis, e. faecium) and pathogens (s. aureus, cn staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. the obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. this confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ery or  cmp. our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.

TI  == effect of growth phase and ph on the in vitro activity of a new glycopeptide, oritavancin (ly333328), against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == oritavancin (ly333328) is a novel glycopeptide with activity against gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. we compared the effects of ph and growth phase on the activity of oritavancin and vancomycin against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant e. faecium. killing curve methods were used to evaluate the effect of growth phase (stationary versus exponential) and ph (6.4, 7.4 and 8.0). an inoculum of 10(6) cfu/ml was used for all experiments. growth phase of s. aureus and vancomycin-susceptible e. faecium did not influence the rate and killing activity of oritavancin. the rate of killing by oritavancin against the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strain was significantly faster and the reduction in cfu/ml at 24 h was significantly greater when the organism was in exponential  compared with stationary growth phase (p < 0.05). in exponential growth phase, time to 99.9% killing was achieved in 0.6 +/- 0.01 h for the vancomycin-resistant strain, whereas in stationary growth phase, oritavancin did not decrease the inoculum by 99.9% within 24 h. oritavancin's activity against s. aureus and vancomycin-susceptible e. faecium was not influenced by the ph conditions tested. oritivancin's killing activity against the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strain was significantly enhanced when tested at ph 7.4 and 8.0 (p < 0.05). our study has demonstrated that oritavancin's activity does not seem to be influenced by the growth phase of the organisms or the ph of the environment when tested against sensitive strains of s. aureus and e. faecium. however, oritavancin's activity might be reduced against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains in stationary growth phase, as seen in infective endocarditis or when organisms are  exposed to an acidic environment.

AB  == the activity of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, was tested against 862 gram-positive cocci isolated in italy and compared with the activities of 12 antibiotics. overall, mic90s for linezolid (2-4 mg/l) indicated an in vitro activity comparable to that of vancomycin in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (4 mg/l), s. epidermidis (2 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible strains. enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid (mic90 2-4 mg/l), glycopeptides and beta-lactams. in e. faecium, only glycopeptides (mic90 2 mg/l)  and linezolid (mic90 2 mg/l) were active. linezolid was the only drug active against two strains of enterococcus showing a vana phenotype. owing to its antibacterial profile, linezolid represents a promising drug for the treatment of gram-positive infections.

TI  == mimicry of host-defense peptides by unnatural oligomers: antimicrobial beta-peptides.
AB  == we have designed beta-amino acid oligomers that are helical, cationic, and amphiphilic with the intention of mimicking the biological activity of amphiphilic, cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides found in nature (e.g., magainins). we have previously identified a 17-residue beta-peptide (called beta-17) with antibiotic activity similar to that of a magainin derivative against four bacterial species, including two clinical isolates that are resistant to common antibiotics. this beta-peptide displays very low hemolytic activity against human red blood cells, which indicates selectivity for bacterial cells over mammalian cells. here we examine some of the factors important for activity in this class of beta-peptides. an amphiphilic helix is necessary, because a nonamphiphilic isomer proved to be inactive. the ratio of cationic to hydrophobic residues is also important. active beta-peptides induce the leakage of beta-galactosidase from treated bacillus subtilis cells, as do alpha-helical antibiotic peptides, and this similarity suggests that the beta-peptide mode of action involves disruption of microbial membranes. this class of beta-peptides is not degraded by proteases, which bodes well for biological applications.

TI  == a multicenter evaluation of linezolid antimicrobial activity in north america.
AB  == overall, 141 centers in north america enrolled in this international surveillance study designed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone. each participant tested the susceptibility of clinical isolates of staphylococcal species (n = 85) against 12 drugs, and enterococcal species (n = 40) against 6 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays; and of streptococcal species (n = 25) against 6 drugs using etests (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). quality control testing was conducted using recommended  strains, and verification of resistance to linezolid and select other agents was  performed by a regional monitor. of the 20,161 isolates collected from sites across the united states (us; n = 132) and canada (n = 9), 18,307 were included in this analysis. oxacillin resistance occurred in 38.7 and 70.6% of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal (cons) isolates, respectively. vancomycin resistance was reported in 65.9 and 2.6% of enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. penicillin resistance occurred in 37.2% of streptococcus pneumoniae, 17.5% constituting high-level resistance (mic, > or =2  microg/ml). the mic(90) for linezolid was 1 microg/ml for streptococci, 2 microg/ml for enterococci and cons isolates, and 4 microg/ml for s. aureus. using the us fda-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance (i.e., mic > or =8 microg/ml). the occurrence of linezolid mics was unimodal and generally varied between, 1-4 microg/ml for staphylococci (94% of recorded results), 1-2 microg/ml for enterococci (93%), and 0.5-1 microg/ml for streptococci (85%). susceptibility to  linezolid was not influenced by susceptibility to other antiicrobials such as vancomycin, beta-lactams or macrolides. only linezolid was universally active against essentially all tested gram-positive specimens. the unimodal susceptibility pattern is indicative of excellent and near complete activity against key gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains, but surveillance for emerging resistances (rare) and the performance of routine susceptibility tests to guide patient therapy seems prudent.

TI  == complexation of peptidoglycan intermediates by the lipoglycodepsipeptide antibiotic ramoplanin: minimal structural requirements for intermolecular complexation and fibril formation.
AB  == the peptide antibiotic ramoplanin inhibits bacterial peptidoglycan (pg) biosynthesis by interrupting late-stage membrane-associated glycosyltransferase reactions catalyzed by the transglycosylase and murg enzymes. the mechanism of ramoplanin involves sequestration of lipid-anchored pg biosynthesis intermediates, physically occluding these substrates from proper utilization by these enzymes. in this report, we describe the first molecular-level details of the interaction of ramoplanin with pg biosynthesis intermediates. nmr analysis in conjunction with chemical dissection of the pg monomer revealed that the ramoplanin octapeptide d-hpg-d-orn-d-allothr-hpg-d-hpg-allothr-phe-d-orn recognizes murnac-ala-gamma-d-glu pyrophosphate, the minimum component of pg capable of high-affinity complexation and fibril formation. ramoplanin therefore  recognizes a pg binding locus different from the n-acyl-d-ala-d-ala moiety targeted by vancomycin. because ramoplanin is structurally less complex than glycopeptide antibiotics such as vancomycin, peptidomimetic chemotherapeutics derived from this recognition sequence may find future use as antibiotics against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and related pathogens.

TI  == an enterococcus faecalis abc homologue (lsa) is required for the resistance of this species to clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis isolates are resistant to clindamycin (cli) and quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d), and this is thought to be a species characteristic. disruption of a gene (abc-23, now designated lsa, for "lincosamide and streptogramin a resistance") of e. faecalis was associated with  a > or =40-fold decrease in mics of q-d (to 0.75 microg/ml), cli (to 0.12 to 0.5  microg/ml), and dalfopristin (dal) (to 4 to 8 microg/ml) for the wild-type e. faecalis parental strain (q-d mic, 32 microg/ml; cli mic, 32 to 48 microg/ml; dal mic, 512 microg/ml). complementation of the disruption mutant with lsa on a shuttle plasmid resulted in restoration of the mics of cli, q-d, and dal to wild-type levels. under high-stringency conditions, lsa was found in 180 of 180 isolates of e. faecalis but in none of 189 other enterococci. among 19 erm(b)-lacking enterococcus faecium strains, 9 (47%) were highly susceptible to cli (mic, 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml) and had dal mics of 4 to 16 microg/ml; for the  remaining erm(b)-lacking e. faecium strains, the cli and dal mics were 4 to > 256 and 2 to > 128 microg/ml, respectively. in contrast, none of 32 erm(b)-lacking e. faecalis strains were susceptible (cli mic range, 16 to 32 microg/ml; dal mic range, > or =32 microg/ml). when lsa was introduced into an e. faecium strain initially susceptible to cli, the mics of cli and dal increased > or =60-fold and that of q-d increased 6-fold (to 3 to 6 microg/ml). introduction of lsa into two  dal-resistant (mics, > 128 microg/ml), q-d-susceptible (mics, 0.5 and 1.5 microg/ml) e. faecium strains (cli mics, 12 and >256 microg/ml) resulted in an increase in the q-d mics from 3- to 10-fold (to 8 and >32 microg/ml), respectively. although efflux was not studied, the similarity (41 to 64%) of the  predicted lsa protein to abc proteins such as vga(a), vga(b), and msr(a) of staphylococcus aureus and yjca of lactococcus lactis and the presence of walker a and b atp-binding motifs suggest that this resistance may be related to efflux of these antibiotics. in conclusion, lsa appears to be an intrinsic gene of e. faecalis that explains the characteristic resistance of this species to cli and q-d.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance: a population perspective.
AB  == the need to stem the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance has prompted multiple, sometimes conflicting, calls for changes in the use of antimicrobial agents. one source of disagreement concerns the major mechanisms by which antibiotics select resistant strains. for infections like tuberculosis, in which  resistance can emerge in treated hosts through mutation, prevention of antimicrobial resistance in individual hosts is a primary method of preventing the spread of resistant organisms in the community. by contrast, for many other important resistant pathogens, such as penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium resistance is mediated by the acquisition of genes or gene fragments by horizontal transfer; resistance in the treated host is a relatively  rare event. for these organisms, indirect, population-level mechanisms of selection account for the increase in the prevalence of resistance. these mechanisms can operate even when treatment has a modest, or even negative, effect on an individual host's colonization with resistant organisms.

TI  == [new treatment option for gram-positive infections in critically ill patients - overview over linezolid].
AB  == introduction: during the last decade, there has been an emergence of multiresistant gram-positive bacteria in intensive care units. oxazolidinones are a new class of antibiotics without cross-resistance to other antimicrobial agents, and linezolid was recently introduced as first oxazolidinone on the german market. in this overview, we summarize important data and discuss possible indications for linezolid in the treatment of infections in critically ill patients. antimicrobial activity and pharmacology: the antimicrobial spectrum comprises mainly gram-positive bacteria, especially staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci. linezolid is mostly bacteriostatic and inhibits the bacterial protein synthesis at an early stage. adults may receive 600 mg b.i.d. intravenously or p. o. about 30 % of the dose are excreted by the kidneys as mother compound and 50 % as metabolites. dosage reductions are not necessary, even in severe renal impairment, but about one third of the dose is eliminated during dialysis. overall, linezolid is well tolerated, but approximately 5 % of the patients may suffer from diarrhea or nausea and there have been a few reports about reversible myelosuppressive side effects. clinical studies: linezolid has been compared to vancomycin for treatment of gram-positive nosocomial pneumonia,  and the clinical cure rates were 66.4 % and 68.1 %, respectively. linezolid is highly active and bactericidal against pneumococci. the clinical cure rates for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections were 88.1 % with linezolid and 86.1  % with penicillinase-stable penicillins. mrsa were excluded in this study, but it may be assumed from data in vitro that linezolid is equally effective against these bacteria. data for the treatment of catheter-associated and other forms of  bacteremias are mainly derived from the compassionate-use-program, where linezolid has been used in complicated cases, mainly after failure of standard therapy. the majority of infections was caused by multiresistant enterococcus faecium and the clinical cure rates were approximately 80 %. comment: the currently available data suggest that linezolid will serve as useful agent in the treatment of severe infections caused by multiresistant staphylococci and enterococci. further studies are necessary to define the role of linezolid as first-line agent, e. g. in the treatment of central venous catheter infections. in light of the severe prognosis of pneumonias caused by mrsa, studies on the combination of linezolid and vancomycin are warranted. despite the low level of resistance, it seems prudent not to use linezolid as first line agent in the treatment of uncomplicated infections, as long as effective standard antibiotics  are available.

TI  == proficiency of italian clinical laboratories in detecting reduced glycopeptide susceptibility in enterococcus and staphylococcus spp. using routine laboratory methodologies.
AB  == objective: to assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and vana-, vanb- or vanc-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. methods: eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (s. aureus atcc 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate s. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683y]) and five enterococci (e. faecalis atcc 29212, e. faecalis atcc 51299 vanb, e. faecium aib40 vana, e. faecalis v583 vanb and e. gallinarum aib39 vanc1) were distributed to 59 italian clinical microbiology laboratories. each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. in addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. results: all 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the  susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. a total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. overall, laboratories were able to identify  isolates to the genus level successfully. e. gallinarum and s. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. for enterococcal test strains, vana phenotypes were detected correctly  by 96.6% of laboratories; vanb by 30.5% (e. faecalis atcc 51299) and 88.1% (e. faecalis v583); and vanc1 by 67.8%. for staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (s. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (s. haemolyticus 10030683y) of the laboratories  were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in vanb and vanc1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. for staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and vitek (software version 5.04) users. overall, considerably fewer errors occurred  with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. for 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of e. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of e. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of s. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying e. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. while vana phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting vanb and vanc phenotypes. the majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older vitek systems. teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. should enterococcal vanb or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. new systems under development, such as vitek2, should improve this situation.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial spectrum and activity of bms284756 (t-3811; a desfluoroquinolone) tested against an international collection of staphylococci and enterococci, including in vitro test development and intermethod comparisons.
AB  == the study was initiated to determine the in vitro activity and mic/disk test comparisons of bms284756, a new des-fluoro(6)-quinolone, against isolates of staphylococci and enterococci from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 2000. isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution and standardized disk diffusion methods. against 3,789 strains of gram-positive cocci from the sentry program (2000), the bms284756 mic90 and percentage susceptible at < or = 2 and <  or = 4 microg/ml were: staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/ml; 89.3 and 97.1%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 4 microg/ml; 86.1 and 96.0%) and enterococci (> 4 microg/ml; 62.0 and 76.2%). also tested were selected staphylococci (300 strains) and enterococci (102 strains) by two standardized methods. the activity of bms284756 was highly correlated with oxacillin resistance among staphylococci. oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci were all inhibited by bms284756 at < or = 0.5 microg/ml, whereas oxacillin-resistant strains required inhibitory concentrations of > or = 1 microg/ml. excellent correlation was observed between the mic and 5-microg disk zone diameter for staphylococci and enterococci (r=0.91 to 0.93). among vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, 67% of enterococcus faecalis, 25% of e. faecium, and 76% of other enterococcus spp. isolates were inhibited by bms284756 at < or = 2 microg/ml. all vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre; 11 e. faecalis and 15 e. faecium) were inhibited by > or = 2 microg/ml of bms284756. among the non-vre, non-faecium enterococcal isolates (n=64), 62% were inhibited by < or = 0.5 microg/ml. bms284756 showed excellent activity against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci and moderate activity against enterococci other than vre and e. faecium. acceptable correlations were observed between mic and disk test results for both  tested genus groups.

TI  == pharmacodynamic properties of hmr 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  == objective: the pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, hmr 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. methods: the time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis. the postantibiotic effects of hmr 3004 were also investigated on these organisms  at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x mic. results: the time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that hmr 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. hmr 3004  exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x mic. conclusions: the bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by hmr 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.

AB  == this study presents our clinical experience with linezolid in 19 patients with serious resistant gram-positive infections enrolled as part of the compassionate  study. in this prospective, non-randomized, noncomparative study, 19 patients were enrolled as part of the national compassionate study protocol conducted by pharmacia-upjohn. at the time of this writing, these patients had not been published in the literature. all of the patients had to have documented evidence  of serious gram-positive infections in normally sterile sites and should have been unable to tolerate available antimicrobial therapy or be unresponsive to available drugs. clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were obtained. patients were followed both short-term and long-term after completion of therapy. nineteen patients were enrolled: 13 females and 6 males. the average age was 63 years. the average length of therapy with linezolid was 22 days. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was treated in eight patients, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) in two patients, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) in eight patients, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus in two patients. co-infecting organisms include enterococcus species colonization in six patients, pseudomonas species in one patient, serratia marcenens in one patient, and candida albicans in one patient. sterile sites that were infected included bone and joint (wounds and septic joints) in six patients, gastrointestinal system (hepatobiliary, liver abscess, crohn's) in  five patients, genitourinary (kidney and urine) in two patients, blood in five patients, respiratory in one patient, and aortic valve in 1 patient. linezolid was given at 600 mg iv every 12 hours with a mean length of therapy of 22 days. surgical drainage was used in combination with linezolid in 11 of the patients. seventy nine percent of these patients achieved clinical and microbiologic cure,  and none of the deaths reported in this series were related to the drug. adverse  events included skin rash in one patient, mild bone marrow suppression in two patients, and mild elevation in liver function tests in two patients. no life-threatening adverse events were noted. it appears that linezolid, along with surgical intervention (when necessary), appears to be an effective treatment option for resistant gram-positive infections. long-term studies evaluating the possible resistance rates are necessary.

TI  == the duel study: a multi-center in vitro evaluation of linezolid compared with other antibiotics in the netherlands.
AB  == objective: to evaluate bacterial susceptibility to linezolid in the netherlands in comparison with other antibiotics. methods: bacterial strains were isolated between september 1999 and january 2000 from patients presumed to require antibiotic treatment. the in vitro activity of 1226 strains from 34 participating laboratories was tested against linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and other antibiotics against enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were obtained with the e test on mueller-hinton agar: every laboratory included control strains. for vancomycin and teicoplanin only, brain-heart infusion agar and an inoculum of 2.0 mcfarland  was used for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci to support a better growth and clear recognition of hetero-resistant  colonies. results: the values of mic90 for linezolid were 1.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci, respectively. six enterococcal strains with decreased susceptibility against vancomycin or teicoplanin were identified as enterococcus  faecium, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus (two strains each) and they were found to harbor vana, vanc1 and vanc2/3 genes, respectively. nine per cent of streptococcus pneumoniae (an increase from 1% 4 years ago) showed decreased susceptibility to erythromycin, of both the ermb and mefe type; there was no cross-resistance with linezolid. twelve coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were resistant to teicoplanin. conclusion: linezolid is a promising drug in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci. cross-resistance with other antibiotics tested was not found.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive uropathogens of hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of linezolid, a recently developed antibiotic agent active against gram-positive bacteria, was tested against pathogens from three different collections. (1) uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients (1990/1991) with complicated and/or hospital-acquired utis; urologic clinic, hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. (2) uropathogens from a multi-centre study (1995/1996) comprising 37 urological centres throughout germany. (3) mrsa isolates of patients and staff (1999/2000) within the hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field-electrophoresis. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of linezolid determined by an agar (isosensitest) dilution method using a multipoint inoculator and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point ranged for methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (n=27) between 2 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (n=35) between 1 and 2 mg/l, for methicillin susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (msse) (n=67) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant cns (mrse) (n=19) between 0.25  and 2 mg/l, for enterococcus. faecalis (n=184) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for e. faecium (n=3) 2 mg/l and for streptococcus spp. (n=4) between 0.25 and 1 mg/l, indicating that all strains were susceptible. according to the in vitro activity, linezolid may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of  complicated uti caused by gram-positive uropathogens. thus, linezolid should be evaluated in a clinical study.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == validation of the sterilization procedure of allogeneic avital bone transplants using peracetic acid-ethanol.
AB  == different procedures are available to inactivate bacteria and fungi, including their spores, as well as viruses in human bone transplants. the most efficient methods are considered to be gamma irradiation and thermal inactivation as well as chemical sterilization methods like the peracetic acid-ethanol treatment (pes). following national and international standards or draft standards, the antimicrobial effectiveness of this procedure was evaluated. due to the standardizable size as well as the clinical relevance, defatted human spongiosa cuboids (15x15x15 mm) served as model system. after treatment with pes for 2 and  4 hours, respectively, the titre of living micro-organisms was determined in the  supernatant and the cuboid. a reduction in the titre of viable micro-organisms below the detection level (reduction factor >5 log10) was already achieved after  an incubation time of 2 hours (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, clostridium sporogenes, mycobacterium  terrae, candida albicans as well as spores of bacillus subtilis). no viable micro-organisms could be detected in any of the pes-treated test cuboids. spores  of aspergillus niger were also completely inactivated. the pes procedure proved to be a reliable method for the sterilization of human bone transplants derived from spongiosa.

TI  == synthesis and biological evaluation of vancomycin dimers with potent activity against vancomycin-resistant bacteria: target-accelerated combinatorial synthesis.
AB  == based on the notion that dimerization and/or variation of amino acid 1 of vancomycin could potentially enhance biological activity, a series of synthetic and chemical biology studies were undertaken in order to discover potent antibacterial agents. herein we describe two ligation methods (disulfide formation and olefin metathesis) for dimerizing vancomycin derivatives and applications of target-accelerated combinatorial synthesis (e.g. combinatorial synthesis in the presence of vancomycin's target ac2-l-lys-d-ala-d-ala) to generate libraries of vancomycin dimers. screening of these compound libraries led to the identification of a number of highly potent antibiotics effective against vancomycin-suspectible, vancomycin-intermediate resistant and, most significantly, vancomycin-resistant bacteria.

TI  == solid- and solution-phase synthesis of vancomycin and vancomycin analogues with activity against vancomycin-resistant bacteria.
AB  == vancomycin, the prototypical member of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics, is a clinically used antibiotic employed against a variety of drug-resistant bacterial strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the recent emergence of vancomycin resistance, viewed as a growing threat to public health, prompted us to initiate a program aimed at restoring the potency of this important antibiotic through chemical manipulation of the vancomycin structure. herein, we describe the development of synthetic technology based on the design of a novel selenium safety catch linker, application of this technology to a solid-phase semisynthesis of vancomycin, and the solid- and solution-phase synthesis of vancomycin libraries. biological evaluation of these  compound libraries led to the identification of a number of in vitro highly potent antibacterial agents effective against vancomycin-resistant bacteria. in addition to aiding these investigations, the solid-phase chemistry described herein is expected to enhance the power of combinatorial chemistry and facilitate chemical biology and medicinal chemistry studies.

TI  == an in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. study design: cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical  mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the  cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group b streptococcus and escherichia coli. results: in the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus, e coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and  patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. in the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group b streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/ml of gentamicin and toward e coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/ml of gentamicin. conclusion: a low-molecular substance  with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.

TI  == a simple model host for identifying gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  == we demonstrate the use of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, but not bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, or streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult c. elegans. focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both e. faecalis and e. faecium kill c. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only e. faecalis kills the adults. in the case of adults, a low inoculum of e. faecalis grows to a high titer in the c. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on e. faecium. interestingly, a high titer of e. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. two e. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. we exploit the apparent parallels between gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an e. faecalis virulence factor, scrb, which is relevant to  mammalian pathogenesis.

TI  == selective cleavage of d-ala-d-lac by small molecules: re-sensitizing resistant bacteria to vancomycin.
AB  == pathogenic enterococci are becoming resistant to currently available antibiotics, including vancomycin, the drug of last resort for gram-positive infections. enterococci pose a significant public health threat, not least because of the risk of transferring vancomycin resistance to the ubiquitous staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin resistance is manifested by cell wall peptidoglycan precursors with altered termini that cannot bind the antibiotic. small molecules with well-oriented nucleophile-electrophile assembly and complementary chirality to the peptidoglycan termini were identified as catalytic and selective cleavers of  the peptidoglycan precursor depsipeptide. these molecules were tested in combination with vancomycin and were found to re-sensitize vancomycin-resistant bacteria to the antibiotic.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

AB  == the susceptibility of 705 bacterial isolates representing 46 different species to e1010 (er-35786), imipenem, meropenem and cefepime was determined by the nccls broth microdilution test. the mic(90)s for e1010 were < or =1.0 mg/l for enterobacteriaceae, fastidious gram-negative bacteria, streptococci and anaerobes. e1010 was two- to four-fold more active than imipenem and meropenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four-fold more active than the other carbapenems against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin-resistant enterococci and most enterococcus faecium were resistant to  all four drugs tested. the nccls disc diffusion test was performed simultaneously on the non-fastidious organisms. assuming the mic breakpoints for e1010 will be the same as for the other carbapenems, the disc diffusion zone diameter breakpoints of imipenem and meropenem would also be applicable to e1010.

TI  == antagonistic effect of enterocin ccm 4231 from enterococcus faecium on "bryndza", a traditional slovak dairy product from sheep milk.
AB  == "bryndza" is a traditional slovak dairy product (type of soft cheese) made from sheep cheese which was ripened for 14 days. because its manufacture, transporting and/or storing represent conditions which facilitate contamination, the effect of enterocin ccm4231 in "bryndza" was investigated with the aim to reduce the contaminant agents. "bryndza" was divided into equal portions (50 g). the experimental sample (es) as well as the control sample one (c1) were inoculated with listeria innocua li1 strain. the other control samples c2 and c3 were without li1 strain. c3 control was selected as a reference control. es and c2 portions were treated with purified enterocin ccm4231 in a concentration of 6400  au/ml. before the experimental inoculation, "bryndza" was checked for the presence of contaminant agents. the experiment lasted 1 week and the samples were stored in the refrigerator at 4 degrees c. sampling was performed on day 1, on day 4 and on day 7. the control samples c2 and c3 were checked only on day 1 and  then after 1 week. the following contaminant agents were detected in "bryndza" before its experimental inoculation with l. innocua li1 strain: escherichia coli  in the amount 10(3) cfu/ml/g, staphylococcus aureus (10(2) cfu/ml/g) and enterococci (10(4) cfu/ml/g). in the control sample c2, the number of e. coli was reduced to 10(2) cfu/ml/g. enterococci and staphylococci were totally eliminated  there. concerning c3 control, natural decrease of bacteria was found and/or their unchanged counts. the value of ph (5) was stable during the whole experiment. in  the experimental sample inoculated with li1 strain, its counts were decreased immediately after enterocin ccm4231 addition approximately by one order of magnitude. this inhibitory effect was also detectable on day 4 by the difference  of one order of magnitude between es and c1. on day 7, 10(3) cfu/ml/g of li1 strain were detected in both samples (es, c1). the difference by one order of magnitude indicated, an inhibitory effect of enterocin ccm4231 in "bryndza". however, bacteriocin activity was not determined by laboratory analyses.

TI  == the relationship of a clonal outbreak of enterococcus faecium vana to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus incidence in an australian hospital.
AB  == australian isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have been widely scattered geographically, predominantly polyclonal and of the vanb phenotype. forty-nine vre were isolated from 47 patients in our hospital from october 1996 to december 1999. forty-four of these vre were enterococcus faecium with a vana glycopeptide resistance genotype. four isolates were pathogenic. thirty-five vre  were from an outbreak in the renal and infectious diseases units over a four-month period. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) demonstrated that 41 of the 49 vre were indistinguishable or closely related. enhanced environmental cleaning, strict contact isolation of colonized patients and reducing inpatient admissions terminated the epidemic. cohorting of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)-positive patients was restricted because vre patients occupied the isolation facilities. this resulted in a statistically significant increase in mrsa infections across the hospital. vre epidemics have the ability to influence the epidemiology of other nosocomial pathogens when infection control resources are exhausted.

TI  == resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  == we studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. no spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for streptococcus pneumoniae). population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. stable s. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. the daptomycin mics for these isolates  were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. many mutants with high mics (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of s. aureus small colony variants. the voltage component (delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. in vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. for other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. these results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.

TI  == distribution of aminoglycoside resistance genes in recent clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium.
AB  == aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (ames) are major factors which confer aminoglycoside resistance on bacteria. distribution of genes encoding seven ames  was investigated by multiplex pcr for 279 recent clinical isolates of enterococci derived from a university hospital in japan. the aac(6')-aph(2"), which is related to high level gentamicin resistance, was detected at higher frequency in  enterococcus faecalis (42.5%) than in enterococcus faecium (4.3%). almost half of e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates possessed ant(6)-ia and aph(3')-iiia. the profile of ame gene(s) detected most frequently in individual strains of e. faecalis was aac(6')aph(2") + ant(6)-ia + aph(3')-iiia, and isolates with this profile showed high level resistance to both gentamicin and streptomycin. in contrast, ame gene profiles of aac(6')-ii+ ant(6)-ia+aph(3')-iiia, followed by aac(6')-ii alone, were predominant in e. faecium. only one ame gene profile of ant(6)-ia+aph(3')-iiia was found in enterococcus avium. the ant(4')-ia and ant(9)-ia, which have been known to be distributed mostly among staphylococcus aureus strains, were detected in a few enterococcal strains. an ame gene aph(2")-ic was not detected in any isolates of the three enterococcal species. these findings indicated a variety of distribution profiles of ame genes among enterococci in our study site.

TI  == linezolid for the treatment of resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == objective: to provide a comprehensive review of linezolid, the first of a new class of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones. therapeutic issues regarding the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and a brief history of the oxazolidinones are also discussed. data sources: a medline search (1966-march 2001) was conducted to identify pertinent literature, including preclinical trials, clinical trials, and reviews. unpublished clinical data, adverse effects, and dosing information were abstracted from product labeling. study selection: clinical efficacy data were extracted from clinical trials, case reports, and abstracts that mentioned linezolid. additional information concerning antibiotic  resistance, the oxazolidinones, in vitro susceptibility and the pharmacokinetic profile of linezolid also was reviewed. data synthesis: linezolid exhibits activity against many gram-positive organisms, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. linezolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis at an early step in translation and is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. efficacy  has been demonstrated in a number of unpublished clinical trials in adults with pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, and vancomycin-resistant e. faecium infections. the adverse effect profile is similar to that of comparator agents (beta-lactams, clarithrornycin, vancomycin). conclusions: linezolid is the first oral antimicrobial agent approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. since the oxazoildinones have a unique mechanism of action and expanded spectrum of activity against virulent and highly resistant gram positive pathogens, linezolid is a valuable alternative to currently available treatment options. clinical trials evaluating linezolid and other oxazolidinones for antibiotic-resistant gram-positive infections, as well as comparator studies comparing linezolid with other candidate drugs, such as quinupristin/dalfopristin and choramphenicol, will further define the role of linezolid.

TI  == screening of some plants from northern argentina for their antimicrobial activity.
AB  == aims: screening of antimicrobial activity in 25 plant species from northern argentina. methods and results: inhibition of microbial growth was measured by a  microplate assay with an oxidation-reduction indicator (alamar blue). test organisms were: escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. weak inhibitory activities (mic=0.5 mg dry matter ml(-1)) were found in methanolic extracts of rivina humilis, crateva tapia, funastrum claucum and schinopsis balansae. stronger bacteriostatic power was detected in vassobia breviflora (mic=0.25 mg ml(-1) against staphylococcus aureus, and 0.5 mg ml(-1) against enterococcus faecium). this activity was purified five-fold by extraction with dichloromethane, and it was found equally effective against susceptible or antibiotic-resistant strains of staph. aureus. in addition, the purified extract  was synergistic with gentamicin, and it was bactericidal at 24 h, with a concentration of 0.25 mg ml(-1). conclusion: there is a significant antimicrobial activity in vassobia breviflora. significance and impact of the study: further studies will be required to disclose the potential importance of these findings.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == linezolid: an oxazolidinone antimicrobial agent.
AB  == background: linezolid is the first oxazolidinone anti-infective agent marketed in the united states. it is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and other susceptible organisms, and  vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections. it also is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, and community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae. objective: this article reviews the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of linezolid. methods: using the terms linezolid, pnu-100766, and oxazolidinone, we  performed a literature search of the following databases: medline (1966 to september 2000), healthstar (1993 to september 2000), iowa drug information service (1966 to september 2000), international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970 to september 2000), pharmaprojects (january 2000 version), and meeting abstracts of  the infectious diseases society of america and the interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy (1996 to 2000). results: linezolid has a unique structure and mechanism of action, which targets protein synthesis at an exceedingly early stage. consequently, cross-resistance with other commercially available antimicrobial agents is unlikely. it is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria. to date, resistance to linezolid has been reported in patients infected with enterococci. the pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid in adults are not altered by hepatic or renal function, age, or sex to an extent  requiring dose adjustment. linezolid is metabolized via morpholine ring oxidation, which is independent of the cytochrome p450 (cyp450) enzyme system; as a result, linezolid is unlikely to interact with medications that stimulate or inhibit cyp450 enzymes. compassionate-use trials and other clinical studies involving mainly adult hospitalized patients with gram-positive infections have shown that linezolid administered intravenously or orally is effective in a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including those caused by resistant gram-positive organisms. reported adverse effects include thrombocytopenia. diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, constipation, rash, and dizziness. preliminary pharmacoeconomic data indicate that a significantly higher percentage of patients receiving linezolid therapy versus comparator could be discharged from the hospital by day 7 (p = 0.005). conclusions: linezolid appears to be effective while maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile. due to the risk of bacterial resistance, linezolid should be reserved for the treatment of documented serious vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == antimicrobial management strategies for gram-positive bacterial resistance in the intensive care unit.
AB  == this article summarizes the current situation with gram-positive infections, including the two primary consequences-failure to cure and resistance-relevant to the intensive care unit. the past few years have seen enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin increase from 10% of strains to approaching 60% of strains in some centers. failure is now so frequent that vancomycin can no longer be safely used. this has lead to use of two new antibiotics, quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid), first marketed in the united states in september 1999, and linezolid (zyvox), which reached the u.s. market in may 2000. both of these agents are being used to treat culture-proven vancomycin-resistant  e. faecium. the calculated areas under the inhibitory curve (auic) values of vancomycin, even when its minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) is 4.0 microg/ml, show almost all vancomycin-resistant e. faecium have auics <125. this  explains failure, as well as the further selection of this bacteria into subpopulations with progressively higher mics. less well defined, but potentially an even greater problem, is the poor efficacy of vancomycin against multiresistant staphylococcus aureus. here, there is evidence of clinical failure in lower respiratory tract infection patients, but in most cases the mic values of the organism have not risen to the point where auics are <125. however, the minimum bactericidal concentration of this organism may be considerably higher than its mic, and in other cases there may be a high inoculum effect or a protein-binding effect to explain the failure of vancomycin to kill multiresistant s. aureus. besides the increasing use of the new agents, strategies to manage these two increasingly resistant gram-positive infections include cephalosporin restriction, switch and streamlining when cultures come back from the lab, combination regimens, and cycling in selected intensive care units.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of quinupristin/dalfopristin tested against gram-positive cocci from latin america: results from the global smart (gsmart) surveillance study.
AB  == gram-positive cocci are important causes of both nosocomial and community-acquired infections, and antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens has become an important problem worldwide. since resistance among these organisms can vary substantially by geographic location, we conducted a multicenter surveillance study with isolates from five latin american countries (15 medical centers). quinupristin/dalfopristin (formerly rp-59500) is a novel streptogramin  combination with focused activity against gram-positive cocci, many exhibiting emerging resistance. the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and 12 other antimicrobial agents were evaluated against 1,948 strains including staphylococcus aureus (747 strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons;446 strains), enterococci (429 strains), and various streptococcus spp. (326 strains). oxacillin resistance was observed in 41% of s. aureus (mic, <e; 2 microg/ml or >e; 13 mm) and 40% of cons (mic, <e; 0.25 microg/ml or >e; 18 mm). vancomycin, teicoplanin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90), 0.25 - 1 mg/ml)  remained effective against all strains, but cross-resistance was high among other tested drugs. the quinupristin/dalfopristin mic(50) for streptococcus pneumoniae  and other streptococci was only 0.5 mg/ml (13% to 28% were penicillin-resistant;  12% to 22% were macrolide-resistant). enterococci demonstrated variable inhibition by quinupristin/dalfopristin depending upon identification and the susceptibility testing method used. the demonstrated quinupristin/dalfopristin activity against enterococcus faecium was confirmed, but potential species identification errors with various commercial systems continue to confuse susceptibility statistics, even though some strains of e. faecium confirmed by pcr-based or other molecular identification techniques did have quinupristin/dalfopristin mics of >e; 4 microg/ml. most important, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci are rapidly emerging in latin america, and quinupristin/dalfopristin appears active against many of these isolates as well as having potency against nearly all staphylococci and streptococci tested at <e; 2 microg/ml or having a zone diameter of >e; 16 mm. comparisons to gsmart results from other continents show nearly identical quinupristin/dalfopristin activity for each gram-positive species tested. these results define the role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in latin american medical centers and provide a benchmark for future in vitro comparisons.

TI  == linezolid pharmacia corp.
AB  == linezolid is an oxazolidinone developed by pharmacia (formerly pharmacia & upjohn) for the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive infections [187765,317456]. it binds to ribosomal 50s subunits, most likely within domain v  within the 23s rrna peptidyl transferase and a secondary interaction with the 30s subunit. this results in inhibition of the initiation of protein translation at an early point, which is probably n-formylmethionyl-trna [335843]. no direct action on dna or rna synthesis has been observed [220169]. linezolid resistance due to a 23s rrna mutation may emerge in enterococci during therapy with this antimicrobial, and may be associated with clinical failure [368652]. following fda approval, linezolid was launched in may 2000 [368526,368652]. in april 2000,  the fda approved linezolid injection, tablets and oral suspension for the treatment of patients with infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. it is indicated for adults in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia (cap), complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vre faecium and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae [363503]. the fda, however, did not grant pharmacia indications for linezolid in the treatment of cap due to either penicillin-resistant s aureus (prsa) or mrsa. in may 2000, merrill lynch predicted sales for 2000 to be us $50 million, rising to us $760 million in 2004  [366910]. in february 2000, p&u predicted that peak sales of the drug had the potential to reach in excess of us $750 million [358429]. in february 1999, morgan stanley dean witter predicted sales of us $40 million in 2000 rising to us $275 million in 2005 [319855]. in december 1998, deutsche bank predicted sales of us $100 million in 2000 rising to us $300 million in 2002 [316769].

AB  == group v phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)) is a recently characterized 14-kda secretory  pla(2) of mammalian heart and macrophage-derived cells. group iia pla(2), which is structurally close to group v pla(2), has been shown to kill gram-positive bacteria in vitro and to prevent symptoms of gram-positive infection in vivo. we  studied the antibacterial properties of fully active recombinant rat group iia and v pla(2)s. both group iia and v pla(2)s were highly bactericidal against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. only high concentrations of group iia pla(2) showed some bactericidal effect against the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli. our results confirm that group iia pla(2) is a potent antibacterial enzyme  against gram-positive bacteria. moreover, we show here that group v pla(2) is a novel antibacterial mammalian protein, but is less potent than group iia pla(2).  both enzymes may be considered as future therapeutic agents against bacterial infections.

TI  == determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  == there are many skin antiseptics commercially available. although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. to date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. an 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems.  freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. a bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. several micro-organisms were investigated: - staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant ent. faecium (vre), s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (pcmx, active compound of dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained  in suspension and glass-carrier tests. the bactericidal activity of the biocides  depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. all biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against ent. faecalis and vre. the antibacterial activity  of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the  suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. in the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of p. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). pcmx, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. chlorhexidine tested against p. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. these results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ  efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.

TI  == quinupristin/dalfopristin: a therapeutic review.
AB  == background: the proliferation of multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), has created a pressing need for effective alternative antibiotics. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new combination streptogramin product with a selective spectrum of antibacterial activity, mainly against gram-positive aerobic bacteria. it has been assessed primarily in emergency-use protocols, in hospitalized patients with skin and skin-structure infections, and in patients with vref bacteremia. objectives: the objectives of this review were to summarize important results of in vitro microbiologic studies; to provide information on relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, drug interactions, and y-site compatibility; and to assess efficacy and safety data from clinical studies of quinupristin/dalfopristin. methods: articles included in this review were identified by a medline search of the literature published between 1966 and september 2000 using the terms synercid, quinupristin, and dalfopristin. additional articles were retrieved from the reference lists of articles identified in the medline search. results: in vitro analysis of the spectrum of activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin has confirmed its relatively selective coverage of gram-positive aerobic bacteria. both quinupristin and dalfopristin undergo hepatic metabolism and are extensively excreted in the feces. combination quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits the cytochrome p450 3a4 pathway, and caution is warranted with concomitant use of other medications eliminated via this pathway. in trials in patients with vref infections, treatment success with quinupristin/dalfopristin varied depending on the site of  infection, ranging from 51.9% in bacteremia of unknown origin to 88.9% in urinary tract infections. the results of comparative clinical trials suggest that quinupristin/dalfopristin has similar efficacy to that of commonly used antibiotics, including cefazolin, oxacillin, and vancomycin, in patients with skin and skin-structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia. the most frequently reported adverse effects with administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin were infusion-site inflammation, pain, and edema; other infusion-site reactions; and thrombophlebitis. arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and rash occurred in 2.5% to 4.6% of patients and were the most frequently reported systemic adverse events. conclusions: outcomes data from clinical trials indicate that quinupristin/dalfopristin has the potential to play an important role in the treatment of bacteremia, complicated skin and skin-structure infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by vref. issues of bacterial resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin and other appropriate uses of this combination agent remain to be elucidated.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo properties of ro 63-9141, a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == ro 63-9141 is a new member of the pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem series of  cephalosporins. its antibacterial spectrum was evaluated against significant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in comparison with those of reference drugs, including cefotaxime, cefepime, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. ro 63-9141 showed high antibacterial in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria except ampicillin-resistant enterococci, particularly vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium. its mic at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited  (mic(90)) for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was 4 microg/ml. ro 63-9141 was bactericidal against mrsa. development of resistance to the new compound in mrsa was not observed. ro 63-9141 was more potent than cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) = 2 microg/ml). it was active against ceftazidime-susceptible strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and  against enterobacteriaceae except proteus vulgaris and some isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. the basis for the antibacterial spectrum of ro 63-9141 lies in its affinity to essential penicillin-binding proteins, including  pbp 2' of mrsa, and its stability towards beta-lactamases. the in vivo findings were in accordance with the in vitro susceptibilities of the pathogens. these data suggest the potential utility of ro 63-9141 for the therapy of infections caused by susceptible pathogens, including mrsa. since insufficient solubility of ro 63-9141 itself precludes parenteral administration in humans, a water-soluble  prodrug, ro 65-5788, is considered for development.

AB  == daptomycin is an investigational lipopeptide antibiotic active against gram-positive organisms. the mechanism of action is unique, resulting in interference with cell membrane transport. the bactericidal activity of daptomycin was evaluated against glycopeptide-intermediate susceptible staphylococcus aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) in an in vitro infection model with simulated endocardial vegetations. simulated regimens of daptomycin at 6 mg/kg/day (d6) and 10 mg/kg/day (d10) were utilized. mics and mbcs for daptomycin were determined in the absence and in the presence of albumin with the following  results (mic/mbc): for gisa-992, 0.5/1.0 and 16/16; for vref-590, 2.0/2.0 and 32/32; and for mrsa-494, 0.25/0.25 and 1.0/4.0 microg/ml, respectively. during the first 8 h daptomycin significantly reduced the inoculum for all organisms. daptomycin at 6 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day had log(10) cfu/g reductions of 5 and  6, 3.4 and 5, and 6.4 and 6.5 by 8 h for gisa-992, vref-590, and mrsa-494, respectively. against both gisa-992 and vref-590, the d10 regimen achieved the limit of detection at 72 h, with d6 regimens showing slight regrowth. a concentration-dependent killing effect was noted to occur, with daptomycin demonstrating a more rapid and greater kill from the d10 versus the d6 regimen. the results of this study suggest that daptomycin demonstrates significant (p < 0.05) activity against gram-positive organisms in a simulated sequestered infection site.

TI  == ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated  for a number of years. to assess the accuracy of data submitted to the world health organization by users of the whonet software, the centers for disease control and prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the united states, for antimicrobial susceptibility  testing as part of the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in klebsiella pneumoniae. many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of streptococcus pneumoniae. the most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of  staphylococcus epidermidis. the proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as enterobacter cloacae. although only a small subset of  laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of  these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing s.  aureus atcc 25923 and s. pneumoniae atcc 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. the narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.

AB  == background: gram-positive bacteria are increasingly found to be causative pathogens in nosocomial infections, and the occurrence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci as well as staphylococci has prompted the investigation of alternative antimicrobial agents active against these strains. everninomycin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic, has excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria, including those resistant to vancomycin. however, avilamycin, a related compound, has been used in europe as a growth promoter in animal food for years and concern has been raised that cross-resistance in clinical isolates may arise. methods: we studied a collection of 268 nosocomial gram-positive isolates from intensive care unit patients with nosocomial pneumonia, urinary tract infection and sepsis, using standard in vitro susceptibility testing. results: it could be shown that all species tested were exquisitely sensitive to everninomycin (mic(90) of 0.38 microg/ml for staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 microg/ml for enterococci and 0.75 microg/ml for coagulase-negative staphylococci). furthermore, no difference could be observed between methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus or between enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. conclusions: these results suggest that everninomycin is a promising antibiotic for the treatment of nosocomial infections in intensive care unit patients and that the use of a related substance as an additive in animal food has not yet promoted resistance in clinical isolates.

TI  == use of preclinical data for selection of a phase ii/iii dose for evernimicin and  identification of a preclinical mic breakpoint.
AB  == one of the most challenging issues in the design of phase ii/iii clinical trials  of antimicrobial agents is dose selection. the choice is often based on preclinical data from pharmacokinetic (pk) studies with animals and healthy volunteers but is rarely linked directly to the target organisms except by the mic, an in vitro measure of antimicrobial activity with many limitations. it is the thesis of this paper that rational dose-selection decisions can be made on the basis of the pharmacodynamics (pds) of the test agent predicted by a mathematical model which uses four data sets: (i) the distribution of mics for clinical isolates, (ii) the distribution of the values of the pk parameters for the test drug in the population, (iii) the pd target(s) developed from animal models of infection, and (iv) the protein binding characteristics of the test drug. in performing this study with the new anti-infective agent evernimicin, we  collected a large number (n = 4,543) of recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus) and determined the mics using e-test methods  (ab biodisk, stockholm, sweden) for susceptibility to evernimicin. population pk  data were collected from healthy volunteers (n = 40) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (n = 12), and the data were analyzed by using npem iii. pd targets were developed with a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with three target pathogens: s. pneumoniae (n = 5), e. faecalis (n = 2), and s. aureus (n =  4). drug exposure or the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve/mic (auc/mic) was found to be the best predictor of microbiological efficacy. there were three possible microbiological results: stasis of the initial inoculum at 24 h (10(7) cfu), log killing (pathogen dependent, ranging from 1 to 3 log(10)), or  90% maximal killing effect (90% e(max)). the levels of protein binding in humans  and mice were similar. the pk and pd of 6 and 9 mg of evernimicin per kg of body  weight were compared; the population values for the model parameters and population covariance matrix were used to generate five monte carlo simulations with 200 subjects each. the fractional probability of attaining the three pd targets was calculated for each dose and for each of the three pathogens. all differences in the fractional probability of attaining the target auc/mic in this pd model were significant. for s. pneumoniae, the probability of attaining all three pd targets was high for both doses. for s. aureus and enterococci, there were increasing differences between the 6- and 9-mg/kg evernimicin doses for reaching the 2 log killing (s. aureus), 1 log killing (enterococci), or 90% e(max) auc/mic targets. this same approach may also be used to set preliminary in vitro mic breakpoints.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive cocci from 25 uk hospitals to antimicrobial agents including linezolid. the linezolid study group.
AB  == the prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst gram-positive cocci from 25 uk hospitals was studied over an 8 month period in 1999. a total of 3770 isolates were tested by the sentinel laboratories using the etest; these bacteria comprised 1000 pneumococci, 1005 staphylococcus aureus, 769 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and 996 enterococci. to ensure quality, 10% of the isolates were retested centrally, as were any found to express unusual resistance patterns. the prevalence of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) varied widely amongst the sentinel laboratories. the resistance rates to methicillin among s. aureus and cns were 19.2 and 38.9%, respectively, with mrsa  rates in individual sentinel sites ranging from 0 to 43%. no glycopeptide resistance was seen in s. aureus, but 6.5% of cns isolates were teicoplanin resistant and 0.5% were vancomycin resistant. vancomycin resistance was much more frequent among enterococcus faecium (24.1%) than e. faecalis (0.5%) (p<0.05), with most resistant isolates carrying vana. the rate of penicillin resistance in  pneumococci was 8.9%, and this resistance was predominantly intermediate (7.9%),  with only six hospitals reporting isolates with high level resistance. the prevalence of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci was 12.3%, with the majority of resistant isolates having the macrolide efflux mechanism mediated by  mefe. all the organisms tested were susceptible to linezolid with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l. the modal mics of linezolid were 1 mg/l for cns and pneumococci, and 2 mg/l for s. aureus and enterococci. linezolid was the most potent agent tested against gram-positive cocci, including multiresistant strains, and as such may prove a valuable therapeutic option for the management of gram-positive infections in hospitals.

TI  == isolation and characterization of human beta -defensin-3, a novel human inducible peptide antibiotic.
AB  == the growing public health problem of infections caused by multiresistant gram-positive bacteria, in particular staphylococcus aureus, prompted us to screen human epithelia for endogenous s. aureus-killing factors. a novel 5-kda, nonhemolytic antimicrobial peptide (human beta-defensin-3, hbd-3) was isolated from human lesional psoriatic scales and cloned from keratinocytes. hbd-3 demonstrated a salt-insensitive broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity against many potentially pathogenic microbes including multiresistant s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. ultrastructural analyses of hbd-3-treated s. aureus revealed signs of cell wall perforation. recombinant hbd-3 (expressed as a his-tag-fusion protein in escherichia coli) and chemically  synthesized hbd-3 were indistinguishable from naturally occurring peptide with respect to their antimicrobial activity and biochemical properties. investigation of different tissues revealed skin and tonsils to be major hbd-3 mrna-expressing  tissues. molecular cloning and biochemical analyses of antimicrobial peptides in  cell culture supernatants revealed keratinocytes and airway epithelial cells as cellular sources of hbd-3. tumor necrosis factor alpha and contact with bacteria  were found to induce hbd-3 mrna expression. hbd-3 therefore might be important in the innate epithelial defense of infections by various microorganisms seen in skin and lung, such as cystic fibrosis.

TI  == bacterial pathogens induce abscess formation by cd4(+) t-cell activation via the  cd28-b7-2 costimulatory pathway.
AB  == abscesses are a classic host response to infection by many pathogenic bacteria. the immunopathogenesis of this tissue response to infection has not been fully elucidated. previous studies have suggested that t cells are involved in the pathologic process, but the role of these cells remains unclear. to delineate the mechanism by which t cells mediate abscess formation associated with intra-abdominal sepsis, the role of t-cell activation and the contribution of antigen-presenting cells via cd28-b7 costimulation were investigated. t cells activated in vitro by zwitterionic bacterial polysaccharides (zps) known to induce abscess formation required cd28-b7 costimulation and, when adoptively transferred to the peritoneal cavity of naive rats, promoted abscess formation. blockade of t-cell activation via the cd28-b7 pathway in animals with ctla4ig prevented abscess formation following challenge with different bacterial pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, and a combination of enterococcus faecium and bacteroides distasonis. in contrast, these animals had an increased abscess rate following in vivo t-cell activation via cd28 signaling. abscess formation in vivo and t-cell activation in vitro required costimulation by b7-2 but not b7-1. these results demonstrate that abscess formation by pathogenic bacteria is under the control of a common effector mechanism that requires t-cell activation via the cd28-b7-2 pathway.

TI  == quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance among gram-positive bacteria in taiwan.
AB  == to understand quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance among clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria in taiwan, where this agent is not yet available for clinical use, we evaluated 1,287 nonduplicate isolates recovered from january 1996 to december 1999 for in vitro susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and other newer antimicrobial agents. all methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus (mssa) isolates were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. high rates  of nonsusceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin (mics, >/=2 microg/ml) were demonstrated for the following organisms: methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa)  (31%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (16%), streptococcus pneumoniae (8%), viridans group streptococci (51%), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (85%), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (100%), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (66%), leuconostoc spp. (100%), lactobacillus spp. (50%), and pediococcus spp. (87%). all isolates of mssa, mrsa, s. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. the rates of nonsusceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin were 5 and 7%, respectively, for cons, ranging from 12 and 18% for s. simulans to 0 and 0% for s. cohnii and s. auricularis. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin had good activities  against these isolates except for ciprofloxacin-resistant vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. in taiwan, virginiamycin has been used in animal husbandry for more than 20 years, which may contribute to the high rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance.

TI  == in vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobial agents against 360 clinical isolates from korea.
AB  == the emergence of multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci such as methicillin-resistant (mr) staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant (vr) enterococci,  and vancomycin-intermediate resistant s. aureus (visa) has given new urgency to the development of new antimicrobial agents. one of these is quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d). we decided to determine the susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated at two university hospitals in seoul to q/d and compare the results with eight other antimicrobial agents. we investigated 120 isolates of s. aureus including 49 mrsas and one visa, 120 isolates of coagulase  negative staphylococci (cns), 64 e. faecalis and 56 e. faecium, including seven strains of vr e. faecium. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for several antimicrobials, including vancomycin and q/d, were determined by broth microdilution. all s. aureus including visa were susceptible to q/d. q/d mic90 for both methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) and mrsa was 0.25 g/ml. 49 (87.5%) of 56 e. faecium including six of seven vr e. faecium were susceptible to q/d. e. faecalis were not susceptible to q/d (only 1.5% susceptible), but were inhibited  by ampicillin (94% susceptible) or vancomycin (95%). cns was susceptible to q/d (96% susceptible) and vancomycin (100% susceptible). one of 38 staphylococci and  two of 17 e. faecium were tolerant to q/d. in conclusion, q/d showed excellent activity against all species of gram-positive cocci including mrsa, visa, and vr  e. faecium except e. faecalis, and may provide a valuable option for the treatment of infections caused by these emerging nosocomial pathogens of gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
AB  == objective: the aim of this study, conducted in the french military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from  nosocomial infection in intensive care units. patients and methods: a prospective study has been conducted from january to december 1998 in all the intensive care  units of the french army. all the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie". results: a total of 849 strains are included in this study. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by escherichia coli (19%) staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (11%) and enterococci (7%). imipenem was  the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. resistance to iii generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (blse) in 36% of cases. this blse could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. the most frequent species producing blse were enterobacter aerogenes (75% of blse) and klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). among the 172 p. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. seventy per cent of the 96 cons and 50.2% of the 126 s. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. a strain of s. aureus and 2 cons strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. twenty per cent of the 59 enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of e. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. one strain of e. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: the evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. high rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among p. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. the implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.

TI  == ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial pathogens: a survey of project icare laboratories.
AB  == a proficiency testing project was conducted among 48 microbiology laboratories participating in project icare (intensive care antimicrobial resistance epidemiology). all laboratories correctly identified the staphylococcus aureus challenge strain as oxacillin- resistant and an enterococcus faecium strain as vancomycin-resistant. thirty-one (97%) of 32 laboratories correctly reported the  streptococcus pneumoniae strain as erythromycin-resistant. all laboratories testing the pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin correctly reported the organism as resistant. of 40 laboratories, 30 (75%) correctly reported resistant mics or zone sizes for the imipenem- and meropenem-resistant serratia marcescens. for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strain of klebsiella pneumoniae, 18 (42%) of 43 laboratories testing ceftazidime correctly reported ceftazidime mics in the resistant range. these results suggest that current testing generally produces accurate results, although some laboratories have difficulty detecting resistance to carbapenems and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. this highlights the need for monitoring how well susceptibility test systems in clinical laboratories detect emerging resistance.

TI  == in vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == background: monoclonal (mabkt) and recombinant single-chain (scfvkt) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (kt) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, kt-cell wall receptors (ktr), have proven to be killed in vitro by mabkt and scfvkt. mabkt and scfvkt exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against ktr of infecting microorganisms. the swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial  resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mabkt and scfvkt against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. materials and methods: mabkt and scfvkt generated by hybridoma and dna recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a kt-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mab kt4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae strains. these bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. results: according to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mabkt and scfvkt. conclusions: scfvkt exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the binding kinetics of triclosan (irgasan) to alloplastic vascular grafts and to examine its antimicrobial activity against various microbial pathogens in vitro. vascular grafts made by intergard (intervascular), fluoropassiv (vascutek), and gore-tex (gore) were examined. grafts were incubated in 10 g/l triclosan (irgasan), dried, sterilized, and incubated in rpmi medium. one-centimeter segments of the grafts were resected under sterile conditions at intervals of minutes, then hours, followed by days and up to 4 weeks. samples were stored frozen at -20 degrees c for the measurement of triclosan bound to the vascular graft by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). the binding kinetics under perfusion conditions were determined for intergard grafts, which were perfused with 50 ml of nutrient medium for 24 hr. samples were taken at various time intervals for the measurement of triclosan. the antimicrobial activity of triclosan against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans as well as enterococcus faecium was determined. triclosan effectively binds to vascular graft without the use of intermediate binding substances. it stayed on the graft  for the duration of 4 weeks. under both static and perfusion conditions, the binding kinetics are similar. triclosan binds most effectively to intergard grafts, less so to fluoropassiv grafts, and not at all to gore-tex material. antimicrobial activity of triclosan is very effective against s. aureus and e. faecium but not against p. aeruginosa.

AB  == temporin a (ta) is a small, basic, highly hydrophobic, antimicrobial peptide amide (flpligrvlsgil-nh2) found in the skin of the european red frog, rana temporaria. it has variable antibiotic activities against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including clinically important methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus as well as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium strains. in this investigation the antimicrobial activity and structural  characteristics of ta synthetic analogs were studied. for antibacterial activity  against s. aureus and enterococcal strains, the hydrophobicity of the n-terminal  amino acid of ta was found to be important as well as a positive charge at amino  acid position 7, and bulky hydrophobic side chains at positions 5 and 12. replacing isoleucine with leucine at amino acid positions 5 and 12 resulted in the greatest enhancement of antibacterial activity. in addition, there was little difference between the activities of ta and its all-d enantiomer, indicating that the peptide probably exerts its effect on bacteria via non-chiral interactions with membrane lipids.

AB  == many food and meat processors test environmental swabs and sponges to confirm the absence of listeria spp. spectral pattern changes in a liquid growth medium, resulting from esculin hydrolysis by listeria in contaminated swabs and sponges,  were automatically monitored by the biosys instrument in a semifluid layer (sfl). the blackening of sfl in modified mox broth resulted in sharply declining curves, which were easily detected by the instrument. the instrument detected all nine strains of listeria monocytogenes tested. none of the gram negative organisms (proteus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas, citrobacter and yersinia) were detected  by the system, nor were most gram positive organisms, including bacillus, streptococcus, and lactobacillus strains, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, which hydrolyze esculin, produced black colonies on palcam and oxford media and were also detected in the system. a total of 122 sponges and swabs collected at food processing plants were evaluated by this method. of these, 99 were negative, and 11 were positive. l. innocua was the dominant listeria species in these environmental samples. good correlation was obtained between numbers of listeria and detection times of esculin hydrolysis: 1000 cfu/swab were detected in 10-13 h, whereas 1-10 cfu/swab were detected in less than 22 h. the total assay time was 26 h.

TI  == prevalence of macrolide-resistance genes in staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium isolates from 24 european university hospitals.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to study the prevalence of the macrolide resistance genes erma, ermb, ermc, msra/msrb, erea and ereb, in 851 clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus and 75 clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium that were erythromycin resistant. the isolates were from 24  european university hospitals. in s. aureus, the erma gene was more common in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates (88%) than in methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates (38%), and occurred mainly in strains with constitutive mls(b) expression. in contrast, ermc was more common in mssa (47%) than in mrsa (5%), occurring mainly in strains with inducible expression. the ereb gene was only found in mrsa isolates expressing a constitutive mls(b) phenotype (1%). the erea gene was not detected. macrolide resistance by efflux due to the msra/msrb gene was only detected in mssa isolates (13%). in contrast to s. aureus, erythromycin resistance in e. faecium was almost exclusively due to the presence of the ermb gene (93%).

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == structure-activity relationships in the series of eremomycin carboxamides.
AB  == a series of new carboxamides of the glycopeptide antibiotic eremomycin was synthesized and investigated in vitro. the goal of the study was the comparison of the influence of the substituents introduced onto the eremomycin skeleton on the activity of these compounds against vancomycin susceptible and resistant bacterial strains. eremomycin amides derived from amines with small substituents  (c0 approximately c4) demonstrated antibacterial activity against vancomycin susceptible strains similar to that of the parent antibiotic and were inactive against vancomycin resistant strains. the derivatives of alkylamines with linear  lipophilic substituents (like c10h21) were active against vana and vanb enterococci strains with the scope of activity similar to that of n'-decyl or 7d-ch2nh-decyl eremomycins described earlier. eremomycin amides of 5-methoxy- and 5-benzyloxytryptamine were active both against vancomycin susceptible and resistant strains. the introduction of a spacer (lysine or piperazine) between the decyl and antibiotic moieties did not seriously influence antibacterial properties of the compounds in comparison with the corresponding derivatives without a spacer. the most active carboxamides are of interest for secondary modifications of the antibiotic.

TI  == characterization of isolates associated with emerging resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) during a worldwide clinical program.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is an i.v. antibiotic active against serious gram-positive infections. its unique dual mode of action means that the potential for resistance development is expected to be low. to determine the incidence of in vitro emerging resistance in worldwide clinical studies, susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin was measured for baseline pathogens and corresponding on- or post-study isolates from 880 evaluable patients. in comparative studies of community-acquired pneumonia, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and nosocomial pneumonia, the incidence of emerging resistance was low (1 of 453; 0.22%; 95% ci: 0. 01-1.4%). resistance development occurred in only one pathogen  (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus). in noncomparative studies, six instances (1.8% of 338 evaluable cases; 95% ci: 0.7 to 4.0%) of emerging resistance (all vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium) were confirmed, accompanied by therapeutic failure in four cases. molecular typing did not confirm the identity of one pair of strains. overall, the incidence of emerging resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was low.

TI  == [glycopeptides].
AB  == objectives: to review pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and therapeutic use of glycopeptides in intensive care units. data sources: extraction from medline database of french and english articles on glycopeptides and search along with major review articles. data selection: the collected articles were reviewed and selected according to their quality and originality. the more recent data were selected. data synthesis: glycopeptides are bactericidal antibiotics which are only active against gram positive species acting by inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis. they had been in clinical use for almost 30 years without high-level resistance underlining. for ten years, there have been disturbing reports of first, resistance to vancomycin in enterococcal species and more recently in strains of staphylococcus aureus by complex and large mechanisms of action. this  new resistances may lead to a therapeutic impasse and a fatal issue for infected  patients. the only response to this situation is the respect of prescription rules and the careful use of antibiotics. conclusion: considering their spectrum, glycopeptides are an antibiotic family which importance is fundamental to treat infected patients of intensive care units. staff members of intensive care units  are responsible for their good use.

TI  == success rates and cost-effectiveness of antibiotic combinations for initial treatment of central-venous-line infections during total parenteral nutrition.
AB  == background: central-venous-line infections can be successfully treated with appropriate antibiotics, thus avoiding the need for catheter removal. based on our experience, vancomycin, gentamicin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amphotericin, alone or in combination, are usually administered, pending sensitivity results. this empirical list, however, has never been verified against actual sensitivity results nor has it been tested for cost or efficacy. methods: medical records of inpatients on hyperalimentation over 1 year were reviewed. success rate, therapy duration, and drug acquisition cost and charge were assessed for central-venous-line infections. antibiotics then were paired and evaluated in terms of charge and efficacy against all microorganisms as determined by sensitivity results. results: in 500 inpatients receiving hyperalimentation for 9,698 patient-days, 8.4 central-venous-line infections/1,000 patient-days occurred. staphylococcus non-aureus, candida species, enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus predominantly were isolated. of the infections, 51 (67%) were sensitive to one or more of the initial antibiotics. a 2-week course of antibiotics successfully treated 50 (66%) catheter infections without line removal. appropriate initial therapy on average  reduced treatment duration by 8 to 10 days and drug charges by $400 to $700. conclusions: amikacin-vancomycin appears to be the most cost-effective selection  for presumed central-venous-line infections, pending sensitivity results, followed by valid alternatives. lower failure rates are well worth the extra cost in pharmaceutical charges.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than  comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin mic90s, < or =1 mg/l, except 4 mg/l against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium). gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae (mic90s, 0.06-0.5  mg/l against most members of the enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/l against proteus/morganella spp.). relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against providencia spp., and had good potency against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.25-1 mg/l). gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had  similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding mic90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. the three quinolones were equipotent against burkholderia cepacia (mic90s, 8 mg/l), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 mg/l). gatifloxacin was highly potent (mic90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/l) against haemophilus influenzae, legionella spp., helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin mic90s, 0.13 mg/l). the higher quinolone mics for ureaplasma (mic90s, 4-8 mg/l) may be due to  the acidic ph of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic90, 0.25 mg/l). of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. in summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and frequency of occurrence of clinical blood isolates in europe from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997 and 1998.
AB  == as part of the european arm of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 25  european university hospitals referred 9613 blood isolates for in vitro testing against >20 antimicrobial agents. escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were the 5 most frequent isolates and accounted for two-thirds of all  referrals, with minor regional variation. of these, approximately 0.36% of e. coli and 16.7% of k. pneumoniae isolates proved to be potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their incidence clearly varied regionally. quinolone resistance was detected among gram-negative species; in particular, p.  aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. considerable regional variation was observed in the incidences of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and penicillin  resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae. the incidence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci was relatively low overall and primarily associated with enterococcus faecium. however, extrapolation of these data to smaller and nonteaching hospitals should be undertaken with caution, since resistance rates may be lower  in these facilities.

TI  == chemotherapy for gram-positive nosocomial sepsis.
AB  == over recent years gram-positive bacterial pathogens have become dominant in many  forms of nosocomial infections. the principal pathogens in severe infections are  staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. the utility of the traditional antibiotics used for nosocomial sepsis, particularly beta-lactam agents, has been severely compromised by the spread of resistance and there was, often, no therapeutic alternative to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin, for empirical (and often also the specific) therapy of infections caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus spp. this reliance on glycopeptides, however, is now also threatened by acquired resistance. vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), particularly e. faecium, have become a therapeutic problem in many european cities and are now endemic in some hospital  wards. the recent reports from several continents of mrsa with reduced glycopeptide-susceptibility (gisa) is of grave concern. new agents are needed to  meet these threats and several classes of compounds are under development. one class is the streptogramins and the combination of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is nearing licensing. clinical trials and a compassionate use programme have already shown it to have considerable promise for the treatment of the most problematic forms of gram-positive nosocomial sepsis, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant e. faecium infections that had failed therapy with other antibiotics.

AB  == rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 teaching, nine associate teaching and nine district general hospitals) in the uk were compared.  combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in teaching  hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for associate teaching and district  general hospitals rates fell (associate teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; district general 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). using conventional methodology to determine mics, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. for streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). for enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year  1, 15.1% year 2, p = 0.0388). for enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin  and rifampicin.

AB  == for the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. we re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the  most common isolates were enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among hospital-acquired infections, acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. the oxacillin resistance of s. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. among enterococcus spp., 85% were either e. faecalis or e. faecium. they were 14% resistant to vancomycin. among gram-negative bacteria, k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. this difference was less apparent in the case of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. these bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. fifty-one percent of salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. isolates from the east were least resistant. plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we  identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against s. aureus, ciprofloxacin against e. coli, and ciprofloxacin against salmonella spp. these findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.

AB  == the intragenomic heterogeneity of the bacterial intergenic (16s-23s rdna) spacer  region (isr) was analysed from the following species in which sequences for the complete rrna operon (rrn) set have been determined (rrn number): enterococcus faecalis (6) and e. faecium (6), bacillus subtilis (10), staphylococcus aureus (9), vibrio cholerae (4), haemophilus influenzae (6) and escherichia coli (7). it was found that some spacer sequence blocks were highly conserved between operons  of a genome, whereas the presence of others was variable. when these variations were analysed using the program plato and partial likelihood phylogenies determined by dnaml for each operon set, three regions showed significant (z>3.3) spatial variation [region i was 78-184 nt long (2.1<z<49.4), region ii was 10-60  nt long (3.7<z<23)] and region iii was 6 nt long (3.4<z>4.4) possibly due to recombination or selection. within region i, there was sequence block variation in all operon sets [some operons contained trna genes (trnaala, trnaile or trnaglu), whereas others had sequence blocks such as vs2 (s. aureus) or rsl (e. coli)]. q analysis of the isr sequence from e. faecalis and e. faecium showed that there was more interspecies than intraspecies variation (both in dna sequence and in the presence or absence of blocks). dot matrix analysis of the sequence blocks in the nine rrn isrs from s. aureus showed that there was significant homology between vs2 and vs5/vs6. furthermore, repeat motifs with only a or t were present in higher copy numbers in vs5/vs6 than in vs2. since these sequence blocks (vs2 and vs5-vs6) are related, intragenic evolution resulting in at expansion may have occurred between these two regions. a model is proposed that postulates a role for recombination and at-expansion in intra-genomic isr variations. this process may represent a general mechanism of concerted evolution for bacterial isr rearrangements.

TI  == in vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, and listeria). ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to  penicillin (s. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, and in listeria monocytogenes isolates. moreover, 1 of 22 s. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 e. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. resistances to levofloxacin with mic90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and e. faecalis isolates. in any case, the mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. in time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an e. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide gram-positive spectrum.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. we compared the  in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. the susceptibility of 37 staphylococcus aureus (14 ms, 23 mr), 26 staphylococcus epidermidis (16 ms, 10 mr), 20 streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 group  a streptococcus pyogenes, 15 streptococcus agalactiae, 10 enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 enterococcus faecium (9 van a) was evaluated. quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all gram-positive species tested, including met-r s. aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l), met-r s. epidermidis (mic < or = 2 mg/l), s. pneumoniae (mic < or = 1 mg/l), ery-r and ery-s streptococci (mic < or  = 1 mg/l). the strains of e. faecalis were generally less susceptible. time-kill  studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x mic concentration showed  a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x mic concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. a prolonged pae was obtained for s. pneumoniae (8 h), s. pyogenes (9 h) and s. agalactiae (7  h), while the shortest pae was seen for e. faecalis and e. faecium (about 4 h).

TI  == effects of genes encoding resistance to streptogramins a and b on the activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin against enterococcus faecium.
AB  == quinupristin-dalfopristin is a streptogramin combination active against multiply  resistant enterococcus faecium. among 45 e. faecium isolated from patients in various french hospitals, only two strains were intermediate (mic = 2 microgram/ml) and one, e. faecium hm1032, was resistant (mic = 16 microgram/ml) to quinupristin-dalfopristin, according to british society for antimicrobial chemotherapy and national committee for clinical laboratory standards approved breakpoints. the latter strain contained the vgb and sata genes responsible for hydrolysis or acetylation of quinupristin and dalfopristin, respectively, and an  ermb gene (also previously referred to as ermam) encoding a ribosomal methylase.  the two intermediate strains had an ls(a) phenotype characterized by resistance to lincomycin (l), increased mics (>/=8 microgram/ml) of dalfopristin (streptogramin a [s(a)]), and susceptibility to erythromycin and quinupristin. this phenotype was also detected in eight other strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. no genes already known and conferring resistance to dalfopristin by acetylation or active efflux were detected in these ls(a) strains. nineteen other strains resistant to erythromycin but susceptible to the  quinupristin-dalfopristin combination displayed elevated mics of quinupristin after induction (from 16 to >128 microgram/ml) and contained ermb genes. the effects of ermb, vgb, and sata genes on the activity of the streptogramin combination were tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin, e. faecium hm1070 and staphylococcus aureus rn4220. the presence of both the sata and vgb genes (regardless of the presence of an ermb gene) was necessary to confer full quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance to the host. the same genetic constructs were introduced into e. faecium bm4107 which displays a ls(a) phenotype. addition of the sata or vgb gene to this ls(a) background conferred resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin.

TI  == costs of treating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == infection with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) or vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) increases the risk of mortality  and results in prolonged hospitalization and high utilization of costly treatment modalities. measures to prevent the spread of mrsa (and possibly vref) include patient isolation and decontamination, hygiene measures, ward closure, and screening of patients and staff for carriage. in seriously ill patients, the increased use of vancomycin for the treatment of mrsa can lead to the emergence of vref colonization/infection. quinupristin/dalfopristin is effective in the treatment of mrsa infections, including nosocomial pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infection, and septicaemia. in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, clinical success rates were equivalent between quinupristin/dalfopristin and vancomycin. in the context of a hospital policy which emphasizes effective hygiene measures and the prudent use of antibacterials, quinupristin/dalfopristin is an effective antimicrobial that can help to control the high costs associated  with multiresistant mrsa and vref infections.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in key bloodstream bacterial isolates: electronic surveillance with the surveillance network database--usa.
AB  == to assess the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among the most common bloodstream isolates, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility data from the surveillance network database-usa, an electronic surveillance system that collects data from 118 clinical microbiology laboratories across the united states. between 1995 and 1997, resistance to both vancomycin and ampicillin was much more prevalent among enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis, suggesting the need for laboratories to identify to species. when staphylococcal  isolates were examined for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 microg/ml), the frequency was highest in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. we also learned that nonsusceptibility to ceftazidime in klebsiella pneumoniae was more prevalent among isolates from blood (12.7%) than among isolates from urine (7.1%) or respiratory sources (9.3%). although antimicrobial resistance is low overall for  isolates of escherichia coli from blood, the prevalence of cefoxitin resistance among ceftazidime-resistant strains (61.9%) suggests the action of mechanisms other than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.

TI  == nosocomial bloodstream infections in united states hospitals: a three-year analysis.
AB  == nosocomial bloodstream infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality. in this study, concurrent surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals over a 3-year period detected >10,000 infections. gram-positive organisms accounted for 64% of cases, gram-negative organisms accounted for 27%, and 8% were caused by fungi. the most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (32%), staphylococcus aureus (16%), and enterococci (11%). enterobacter, serratia, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and  candida were more likely to cause infections in patients in critical care units.  in patients with neutropenia, viridans streptococci were significantly more common. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common pathogens on all clinical services except obstetrics, where escherichia coli was most common. methicillin resistance was detected in 29% of s. aureus isolates and 80% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. vancomycin resistance in enterococci was species-dependent--3% of enterococcus faecalis strains and 50% of enterococcus faecium isolates displayed resistance. these data may allow clinicians to better  target empirical therapy for hospital-acquired cases of bacteremia.

TI  == prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in 20 european university hospitals participating in the european sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the current prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in europe and compare the in vitro activity of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin against 7057 bacterial isolates from 20 university hospitals participating in the european sentry antimicrobial surveillance programme. amikacin exhibited better in vitro activity than tobramycin and gentamicin against most gram-negative bacilli in europe. the resistance levels were 0.4-3% for amikacin, 2-13.1% for gentamicin, and 2.5-15.3% for tobramycin among different members of the family enterobacteriaceae. of the staphylococcus aureus  isolates tested, 75% were susceptible to gentamicin. only 21% of all enterococcal strains tested were fully susceptible to gentamicin. although intra-country variations in the prevalence of resistance phenotypes in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as in staphylococci and enterococci did occur, aminoglycoside resistance rates were generally higher in italy, portugal, spain, greece, france, the uk, and poland than in austria, belgium, germany, the netherlands, and switzerland. compared with the 1987-88 data of the european study group on antibiotic resistance, gentamicin resistance  has increased up to 5% in some gram-negative bacterial species. furthermore, a greater than 10% increase in resistance to gentamicin has been seen in staphylococcus aureus during the last decade. the reason for this observation is  unclear, although changes in antibiotic prescribing patterns that result in increased selective pressure from gentamicin may have contributed to these increased rates of aminoglycoside resistance.

TI  == recent developments in streptogramin research.
AB  == the streptogramins are a class of antibiotics remarkable for their antibacterial  activity and their unique mechanism of action. these antibiotics are produced naturally, but the therapeutic use of the natural compounds is limited because they do not dissolve in water. new semisynthetic derivatives, in particular the injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin, offer promise for treating the rising number of infections that are caused by multiply resistant bacteria. the streptogramins consist of two structurally unrelated compounds, group a and group b. the group a compounds are polyunsaturated macrolactones: the group b compounds are cyclic hexadepsipeptides. modifications of the group b components have been mainly performed on the 3-hydroxypicolinoyl, the 4-dimethylaminophenylalanine and the 4-oxo pipecolinic residues. semi-synthesis on this third residue led to the water-soluble derivative quinupristin. water-soluble group a derivatives were obtained by michael addition of aminothiols to the dehydroproline ring of pristinamycin iia. followed by oxidation of the intermediate sulfide into the sulfone derivatives (i.e., dalfopristin). water-soluble derivatives (both group a and group b) can now be obtained at the industrial scale. modified group b compounds are now also being produced by mutasynthesis, via disruption of the papa gene. mutasynthesis has proved particularly useful for producing pib, the group b component of the oral streptogramin rpr 106972. the streptogramins inhibit bacterial growth by disrupting the translation of mrna into protein. both the group a and group b compounds bind to the peptidyltransferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. the group a compounds interfere with the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing the binding of aa-trna to the ribosome and the formation of peptide bonds, while the b compounds stimulate the dissociation of the peptidyl-trna and  may also interfere with the release of the completed polypeptide by blocking its  access to the channel through which it normally leaves the ribosome. the synergy  between the group a and group b compounds appears to result from an enhanced affinity of the group b compounds for the ribosome. apparently, the group a compound induces a conformational change such that b compound binds with greater  affinity. the natural streptogramins are produced as mixtures of the group a and  b compounds, the combination of which is a more potent antibacterial agent than either type of compound alone. whereas the type a or type b compound alone has, in vitro and in animal models of infection, a moderate bacteriostatic activity, the combination of the two has strong bacteriostatic activity and often bactericidal activity. minimal inhibitory concentrations of quinupristin/dalfopristin range from 0.20 to 1 mg/l for streptococcus pneumonae,  from 0.25 to 2 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus and from 0.50 to 4 for enterococcus faecium, the principal target organisms of this drug. quinupristin/dalfopristin also has activity against mycoplasmas, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenz, legionella spp. and moraxella catarrhalis. bacteria develop resistance  to the streptogramms by ribosomal modification, by producing inactivating enzymes, or by causing an efflux of the antibiotic. dimethylation of an adenine residue in rrna, a reaction that is catalyzed by a methylase encoded by the erm gene class, affects the binding of group b compounds (as well as the macrolides and lincosamides; hence, mlsb resistance), but group a and b compounds usually maintain their synergy and their bactericidal effect against mlsb-resistant strains. erm genes are widespread both geographically and throughout numerous bacterial genera. several types of enzymes (acetyltransferases, hydrolases) have  been identified that inactivate the group a or the group b compounds. genes involved in streptogramin efflux have so far been found only in staphylococci, particularly in coagulase-negative species

AB  == resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin in the clinical isolate enterococcus faecium hm1025 is due to a ribosomal methylase encoded by an ermam-like gene and  the plasmid-mediated inactivation of these antibiotics. we have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene responsible for the inactivation of lincosamides, linb. this gene encodes a 267-amino-acid lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase. the enzyme catalyzes 3(5'-adenylation) (the adenylation of the hydroxyl group in position 3 of the molecules) of lincomycin and clindamycin. expression of linb was observed in both escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. the deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme did not display any significant homology with staphylococcal nucleotidyltransferases encoded by lina and lina' genes. sequences homologous to linb were found in 14 other clinical isolates of e. faecium, indicating the spread of the resistance trait in this species.

TI  == epidemiologic trends in nosocomial and community-acquired infections due to antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria: the role of streptogramins and other newer compounds.
AB  == the gram-positive cocci have clearly re-emerged as important pathogens world-wide in the past two decades. staphylococci, including the coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus, and the enterococci account for approximately one-third of all blood stream infections and as much as 50% of nosocomial blood stream infections. although streptococcus pneumoniae is often considered a community-acquired pathogen, it is also an important cause of nosocomial infection. the hallmark of these gram-positive pathogens is increasing resistance to available antimicrobial agents. of particular note is resistance to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), aminoglycosides (high-level), and penicillins among the enterococci (especially e. faecium), resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins (oxacillin and methicillin) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) among staphylococci, and resistance to penicillin, other beta-lactams and macrolides among the pneumococci. the recent detection of decreased susceptibility to vancomycin among s. aureus is also quite ominous. in many instances the ability of the clinical laboratory to accurately characterize these resistant isolates is suboptimal, further compounding the problem. increased understanding of resistance mechanisms and correlations of resistance genes with the phenotypic expression of resistance has allowed for modifications and improvements of reference susceptibility tests  and interpretive breakpoints. new compounds for effective therapy of infection with multi-resistant gram-positive species are clearly needed. to this end, the streptogramin combination, quinupristin/dalfopristin, has demonstrated significant activity against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin-resistant e. faecium. other candidate drugs including gram-positive active fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and trovafloxacin) and novel compounds such as the everninomicin derivatives (sch27899), ketolides, and oxazolidinones (linezolid) have been shown to be active against these organisms and are under rapid clinical development.

TI  == cell-wall determinants of the bactericidal action of group iia phospholipase a2 against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we have shown previously that a group iia phospholipase a2 (pla2) is responsible  for the potent bactericidal activity of inflammatory fluids against many gram-positive bacteria. to exert its antibacterial activity, this pla2 must first bind and traverse the bacterial cell wall to produce the extensive degradation of membrane phospholipids (pl) required for bacterial killing. in this study, we have examined the properties of the cell-wall that may determine the potency of group iia pla2 action. inhibition of bacterial growth by nutrient deprivation or  a bacteriostatic antibiotic reversibly increased bacterial resistance to pla2-triggered pl degradation and killing. conversely, pretreatment of staphylococcus aureus or enterococcus faecium with subinhibitory doses of beta-lactam antibiotics increased the rate and extent of pl degradation and/or bacterial killing after addition of pla2. isogenic wild-type (lyt+) and autolysis-deficient (lyt-) strains of s. aureus were equally sensitive to the phospholipolytic action of pla2, but killing and lysis was much greater in the lyt+ strain. thus, changes in cell-wall cross-linking and/or autolytic activity can modulate pla2 action either by affecting enzyme access to membrane pl or by the coupling of massive pl degradation to autolysin-dependent killing and bacterial lysis or both. taken together, these findings suggest that the bacterial envelope sites engaged in cell growth may represent preferential sites  for the action and cytotoxic consequences of group iia pla2 attack against gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin and rpr 106972 were active in vitro against a wide range of aerobic gram-positive organisms including enterococcus faecium. however, most isolates of enterococcus faecalis were resistant or of intermediate sensitivity. against staphylococcus aureus quinupristin/dalfopristin was more active but for all other species the range of activity of the two drugs was the same or rpr 106972 was more active. rpr 106972 was also more active against the respiratory pathogens haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. quinupristin/dalfopristin mics for isolates of h. influenzae (1-8 mg/l) clustered around the breakpoint. there were differences in the quality of growth, but little difference in mics or zone diameters was obtained on three different media: mueller-hinton (mha), iso-sensitest (isa), and diagnostic sensitivity test (dst) agars. the addition of blood to the medium increased mics 2- to 4-fold, with mha showing the greatest increase, and reduced zone diameters around quinupristin/dalfopristin discs by 3-4 mm, with the greatest effect on isa.

AB  == during a 2-year period, 10 portuguese hospitals located throughout the country studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinically relevant staphylococci and enterococci. of more than 12,000 staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, two main  patterns were found, methicillin-sensitive organisms most of them resistant only  to penicillin but a few to other antimicrobials and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains (prevalence 48.2%) resistant to most of the antimicrobials  tested and uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 71% of s. epidermidis (approximately 5,000 isolates tested)  and 84% s. haemolyticus (approximately 1,000 isolates tested) were also resistant to methicillin as well as most other antimicrobials except vancomycin. most of the 5,000 enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin, in contrast to 650 e. faecium isolates, 70% of which were resistant to ampicillin and 20% to vancomycin and all other antibiotics. a high prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance occurred in both enterococcus species. this survey showed that resistance profiles of staphylococci and enterococci hospital isolates have not changed in the last 5 years in portugal, with the exception of the rise in vancomycin resistance in e. faecium. the high prevalence of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and in the cns remains an issue of medical concern.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin tested against 1676 strains of ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-positive cocci isolated from patient infections in north and south america.
AB  == gatifloxacin (formerly am-115) is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum against gram-positive cocci and some anaerobes. to assess this  new agent's activity, a collection of 1,676 gram-positive cocci were selected for resistance to ciprofloxacin (> or = 4 micrograms/ml) and tested against gatifloxacin and 18 other compounds by reference broth microdilution methods. the strains (approximately 23,000 total isolates from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program) were from significant blood stream, respiratory tract, wound, and urinary tract infections in patients in north (38 hospitals) and south (10 hospitals) america. against enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, gatifloxacin inhibited only 16% and 10% of strains compared with 12% and 5% for recently released trovafloxacin, respectively. among staphylococcus aureus (90% oxacillin-resistant) strains, gatifloxacin was more active (67% susceptible at <  or = 4 micrograms/ml) than trovafloxacin (59%) or sparfloxacin (4%). gatifloxacin had a wider spectrum than trovafloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci  especially s. epidermidis, 2% versus 58% resistance. the glycopeptides, chloramphenicol and rifampin were most active. against all genus/species groups with more than 100 sample strains (1,566), high-level resistance to gatifloxacin  and trovafloxacin (> 4 micrograms/ml) was not significantly different (41.7% versus 39.1%; p > 0.05). emerging resistance to the fluoroquinolones remains a clinical problem among gram-positive species, and gatifloxacin seems to be active in vitro against many of these contemporary strains isolated in the americas.

AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

TI  == resistant penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins (pbps), which participate in the beta-lactam resistance of several pathogenic bacteria, have different origins. natural transformation and recombination events with dna acquired from neighbouring intrinsically resistant organisms are responsible for the appearance of mosaic genes encoding two or three low-affinity pbps in highly resistant strains of transformable microorganisms such as neisseria and streptococcus pneumoniae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains possess the meca determinant gene, which probably evolved  within the staphylococcus genus from a closely related and physiologically functional gene that was modified by point mutations. the expression of meca is either inducible or constitutive. a stable high-level resistant phenotype requires the synthesis of a normally constituted peptidoglycan. enterococci have  a natural low susceptibility to beta-lactams related to the presence of an intrinsic low-affinity pbp. highly resistant enterococcal strains overexpress this pbp and/or reduce its affinity.

AB  == lonchocarpol a, a flavanone, demonstrates in vitro inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. this activity is antagonized by mouse plasma, which may account for its  lack of in vivo activity. this compound demonstrates no differentiation with respect to the inhibition of rna, dna, cell wall, and protein synthesis.

TI  == genesis of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), how treatment of mrsa infections has selected for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and the importance of antibiotic management and infection control.
AB  == we extensively studied the epidemiology and time course of endemic methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in the millard fillmore hospital, a 600-bed teaching hospital in buffalo. the changeover from methicillin-susceptible s. aureus to mrsa begins on the first hospital day, when  patients are given cefazolin as presurgical prophylaxis. under selective antibiotic pressure, colonizing flora change within 24 to 48 hours. for patients  remaining hospitalized, subsequent courses of third-generation cephalosporins further select and amplify the colonizing mrsa population. therefore, managing antibiotic selective pressure might be essential. other strategies include attention to dosing, so that serum concentrations of drug exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration, and antibiotic cycling. although there are some promising new antibiotics on the horizon, it is necessary to deal with many resistance patterns by using the combined strategies of infection control and antibiotic management.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of nisin against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == the rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the search for alternative antibacterial agents. we examined the efficacy of the antibiotic nisin against 56 multidrug-resistant isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 staphylococcus aureus and 29 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates. the test strains represented a large  variety of clonal types (as determined by a combination of dna fingerprints) isolated from a variety of geographic sources, and included some of the major internationally-spread multiresistant epidemic clones of s. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mrsa strains resistant to over 16 generically distinct antibacterial agents, and enterococcal strains resistant to  all currently available chemotherapeutic agents including glycopeptides. in the overwhelming majority of cases, treatment of growing cultures with nisin at 1 mg/l (s. pneumoniae) or 10-20 mg/l (in mrsa and enterococci) caused extensive (10(3)- to 10(4)-fold) loss of viable titre accompanied by various degrees of loss in the optical density of the cultures, which was most extensive in pneumococci (>90%) and least extensive (40-50%) in enterococci. nevertheless, extensive variation in rates of nisin-induced autolysis was observed in each bacterial species. serial exposure of a penicillin-susceptible strain of s. pneumoniae to nisin (1 mg/l) in liquid culture resulted in the rapid appearance of stable nisin-resistant mutants in which the mic increased from 0.4 to 6.4 mg/l and the resistance trait was transferable by genetic transformation.

AB  == the pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), hmr 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (pae). the time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis. the paes of hmr 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x mic. the time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that hmr 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. hmr 3647 exhibited a significant pae with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x mic. the bacteriostatic activity and significant pae demonstrated by hmr 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.

TI  == [antibacterial effectiveness of povidone-iodine (betaisodona) against highly resistance gram positive organisms].
AB  == antiseptics that are locally applicable gain in significance due to their reliable microbicidal effectiveness and especially due to the rising incidence of highly resistant bacteria. this is because systemically applied antibiotics are not sufficient in eradicating superficial mucodermal bacteria and locally applied antibiotics can cause new resistance rapidly. the aim of this study was to demonstrate the microbicidal effectiveness of poly(1-vinyl-2-pyrrodlidon)-iodine  (pvp-iodine) against ten genotypical different methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus-(mrsa-) and five enterococcus faecium-strains in a quantitative suspension test. the effectiveness of pvp-iodine with protein load (0.2% and 2% albumin) was tested against three mrsa strains. without any protein  load best microbicidial activity (krt-value > 5) was obtained with concentrations in the range between 1-10% of the original betaisodona solution after 30s exposure time. with protein load (0.2% albumin) the optimum in microbicidal effectiveness shifts to concentrations > or = 10% betaisodona solution referring  to an exposure time of 30s. with a protein load up to 2% albumin and an exposure  time of 30s the bactericidal activity of the undiluted betaisodona solution is already satisfying, while the 10% solution is not active till an exposure time of 5 min. summing up pvp-iodine is recommended as a local mucodermal antiseptic against highly resistant gram positives.

AB  == the activities of the oxazolidinone antibacterial agents eperezolid (pnu-100592)  and linezolid (pnu-100766) were compared with that of vancomycin against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (n = 200), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 100), and vancomycin-susceptible and  -resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (n = 50). eperezolid and linezolid demonstrated good in vitro inhibitory activity, regardless of methicillin susceptibility for staphylococci (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90] range, 1 to 4 microg/ml) or vancomycin susceptibility for enterococci (mic90 range, 1 to 4 microg/ml). in time-kill studies, eperezolid and linezolid were bacteriostatic in action. a postantibiotic effect of 0.8+/-0.5 h was demonstrated for both eperezolid and linezolid against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, and e. faecium.

TI  == vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium in a long-term care facility.
AB  == objective: to describe the epidemiology and natural history of colonization with  vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) in a long-term care facility. design: all patients in whom vref was isolated were followed prospectively, with  rectal swab cultures at 2-week intervals, until discharge, death, or clearance of vref. clearance was defined as two consecutive negative cultures. in addition, three prevalence surveys were conducted of all patients in residence on one 34-bed intermediate care ward. setting: a 400-bed, long-term care veterans affairs facility. participants: thirty-six patients colonized with vref. results: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium was identified in 24 of the 36 patients at the time of transfer from an acute care facility. seventeen patients had concomitant methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and seven patients had a recent history of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. vref in these patients persisted for a median of 67 days after identification. treatment of vref colonization with antimicrobials was associated with prolongation of colonization. serial surveillance of the 34-bed ward found stable rates of colonization, with only three documented instances of vref acquisition. during 2.5 years of surveillance for infection, a single case of bacteremia occurred in  a patient in whom colonization with vref could not be demonstrated by rectal swab culture. no infections occurred in patients colonized with vref. conclusions: long-term care patients have protracted carriage of vref. most will improve over  time; however, receipt of antimicrobial therapy is associated with prolongation of vref carriage. the risk of vref infection is low in this population. when there are appropriate contact precautions, patient to patient transmission occurs at a low rate. these observations can be used to design a practical infection control strategy for long-term care facilities.

AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == biochemical and genetic characterization of enterocin p, a novel sec-dependent bacteriocin from enterococcus faecium p13 with a broad antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  == enterocin p is a new bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13 isolated from a spanish dry-fermented sausage. enterocin p inhibited most of tested spoilage and food-borne gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, such as listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum. enterocin p is produced during growth in mrs broth from 16 to 45 degrees c; it is heat resistant (60 min at 100 degrees c; 15 min at 121 degrees c) and can withstand exposure to ph between 2.0 and 11.0, freeze-thawing, lyophilization, and long-term storage at 4 and -20 degrees c. the bacteriocin was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, cation-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, and reverse-phase liquid chromatography. the sequence of 43 amino acids of the n terminus was obtained by  edman degradation. dna sequencing analysis of a 755-bp region revealed the presence of two consecutive open reading frames (orfs). the first orf encodes a 71-amino-acid protein containing a hydrophobic n-terminal sec-dependent leader sequence of 27 amino acids followed by the amino acid sequence corresponding to the purified and sequenced enterocin p. the bacteriocin is apparently synthesized as a prepeptide that is cleaved immediately after the val-asp-ala residues (positions -3 to -1), resulting in the mature bacteriocin consisting of 44 amino  acids, and with a theoretical molecular weight of 4,493. a second orf, encoding a putative immunity protein composed of 88 amino acids with a calculated molecular  weight of 9,886, was found immediately downstream of the enterocin p structural gene. enterocin p shows a strong antilisterial activity and has the consensus sequence found in the pediocin-like bacteriocins; however, enterocin p is processed and secreted by the sec-dependent pathway.

TI  == cloning of the staphylococcus aureus ddh gene encoding nad+-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenase and insertional inactivation in a glycopeptide-resistant isolate.
AB  == the mechanism of low-level glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci is not known. a cytoplasmic protein, provisionally called ddh (w. m. milewski, s. boyle-vavra, b. moreira, c. c. ebert, and r. s. daum, antimicrob. agents chemother. 40:166-172, 1996), and the rna transcript that contains the ddh gene,  which encodes ddh, are present in increased amounts in a vancomycin-resistant isolate, 523k, compared with the susceptible parent isolate, 523. sequence analysis had previously revealed that ddh is related to nad+-dependent d-lactate  dehydrogenase (d-nldh) and vanh. this latter protein is essential for high-level  glycopeptide resistance in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis by synthesizing the d-lactate needed for biosynthesis of d-lactate-terminating peptidoglycan precursors with low affinity for vancomycin. we now provide the direct evidence that the ddh gene product is staphylococcus aureus d-nldh and hereafter refer to the protein as d-nldh. however, overproduction of this protein in isolate 523k did not result in production of d-lactate-containing peptidoglycan precursors, and susceptibility testing of ddh mutants of 523k demonstrated that s. aureus d-nldh is not necessary for glycopeptide resistance in this isolate. we conclude that the mechanism of glycopeptide resistance in this isolate is distinct from that in enterococci.

AB  == teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is administered both intramuscularly and intravenously. it has a prolonged half-life and a less toxic  profile in comparison to those of vancomycin. the efficacy of a single dose of teicoplanin (18 mg/kg of body weight given intramuscularly) for the prevention of endocarditis due to streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was evaluated after applying the rabbit model. vancomycin at a single dose of 30 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to mrsa and  e. faecium, while ampicillin at a single dose of 40 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to s. oralis. rabbits in the teicoplanin group were infected at 1 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of each strain. rabbits in the other groups were infected at 0.5 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of s. oralis (ampicillin group)  or e. faecium and mrsa (vancomycin group). all rabbits were sacrificed 5 days later. teicoplanin and vancomycin protected the animals challenged with e. faecium by 87.5 and 50%, respectively, and protected the animals challenged with  mrsa by 100 and 92%, respectively. teicoplanin and ampicillin protected the animals challenged with s. oralis by 100 and 77%, respectively. prevention of endocarditis by teicoplanin was likely to be due to a prolonged inhibition of bacterial growth by the sustained supra-mics. it is concluded that teicoplanin is very effective in preventing experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis and may be an attractive alternative antibiotic in patients allergic to beta-lactams, especially in the outpatient setting.

AB  == protegrin-1 (pg-1) is a cysteine-rich, 18-residue beta-sheet peptide isolated from porcine leukocytes with antimicrobial activity against a broad range of microorganisms. the mics of pg-1 against representative gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria ranged from 0.12 to 2 microg/ml. at these levels, pg-1 was rapidly bactericidal in vitro, reducing the number of viable cfu of either methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) or pseudomonas aeruginosa by more than three log units in less than 15 min. resistance to pg-1 did not develop after 11 subculturings of p. aeruginosa or 18 subcultures of mrsa in mueller-hinton broth containing pg-1 at one-half the mic. under similar conditions of serial passage, the mics of norfloxacin and gentamicin against p. aeruginosa increased 10 and 190 times, respectively. similarly, the mic of norfloxacin against mrsa increased 85 times. immunocompetent mice inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with p. aeruginosa or s. aureus exhibited 93 to 100% mortality in the vehicle control group compared with 0 to 27% mortality in animals that received a single i.p. injection of pg-1 (0.5 mg/kg of body weight). mice inoculated with s. aureus by intravenous (i.v.) injection and dosed 0 to 60  min later with a single i.v. injection of pg-1 (5 mg/kg) had a mortality of 7 to  33%, compared to a mortality of 73 to 93% in the vehicle controls. in leukopenic  mice inoculated i.v. with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, mortality was 87% in the vehicle control group and 33% in animals that received a single i.v. injection of pg-1 (2.5 mg/kg). taken together, these data indicate that pg-1 has potential for use as an antimicrobial agent in the treatment of local or systemic infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.

AB  == rpr 106972 is a novel oral streptogramin combination with reported therapeutic potency against gram-positive and certain respiratory tract pathogens. mics for rpr 106972, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and seven comparison drugs were determined by the reference methods against 337 strains selected to define spectrum and potency. rpr 106972 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mic ranges of 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also inhibited by rpr 106972 (mic90, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml)  and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic90, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). against all streptococcal strains tested (including penicillin-resistant pneumococcus), rpr 106972 was highly active with mic results at < or = 1 microgram/ml. rpr 106972 inhibited corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). moraxella catarrhalis (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml), and some haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 2 micrograms/ml). rpr 106972 and quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated little activity against enterococcus faecalis (mic90s, 4 to 32 micrograms/ml) as compared to enterococcus faecium (mic90s, 0.5 to 1 microgram/ml) and other enterococcus ssp. (mic90s, 1 microgram/ml). studies to establish mic quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for s. aureus atcc 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml;  and for streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. the results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of rpr 106972 against gram-positive bacteria and selected gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of squalamine mimics.
AB  == we investigated the antimicrobial properties of compounds with structural features that were designed to mimic those of squalamine, an antibiotic isolated  from the stomach of the dogfish shark. the mimics, like squalamine, are sterol-polyamine conjugates. unlike squalamine, the mimics were simple to prepare, at high yield, from readily available starting materials. several squalamine mimics showed activity against gram-negative rods, gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and fungi. some had little or no hemolytic activity. the hydrophobicity of the sterol backbone and the length and the cationic charge of the side chains appeared to be critical determinants of activity. one of the squalamine mimics, sm-7, was bactericidal against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and s. aureus; its activity was decreased by divalent or monovalent cations and by bovine serum albumin. subinhibitory concentrations of sm-7 markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of rifampin against gram-negative rods. these results suggest that the compounds may disrupt an outer membrane of gram-negative rods. squalamine mimics are a new class of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. the antagonism of their activity by serum and albumin and their hemolytic properties may limit their use as systemic agents. the squalamine mimics, because of their potencies, broad spectra of antimicrobial activity, and  potential for systemic toxicity, appear to be good candidates for development as  topical antimicrobial agents.

TI  == pharmacodynamic evaluation of a new glycopeptide, ly333328, and in vitro activity against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to compare the in vitro activity of ly333328 (ly) to that of vancomycin (v) alone and in combination with gentamicin  (g) and rifampin (r) against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and v-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), by using the killing curve methods.  in addition, the effect of the inoculum size and protein on ly's activity was evaluated by using mics and killing curves. mics, mbcs, and killing curves were determined with supplemented mueller-hinton broth (b), b with albumin (4 g/dl) (a), and b with 50% pooled human serum (s). for mrsa, time to 99.9% killing after exposure to ly at four times the mic (4x mic) was achieved at 0.5 +/- 0 h (mean +/- standard deviation) and was significantly faster than that by v (8.54 +/- 0.10 h; p = 0.001). against vref, ly decreased the inoculum by 2.2 log10 cfu/ml at 24 h (p = 0.002). with a large inoculum of mrsa, the activity of ly and v at 4x mic was decreased compared to that with the standard inoculum (p = 0.0003) and regrowth occurred at 24 h. the reduction in the number of cfu per milliliter at 24 h to 2 log10 cfu/ml was restored by increasing the ly concentration to at least 16x mic. at 24 h, the combinations of ly and g, ly and r, ly and v, and v and g were better than either ly or v alone against a large inoculum of mrsa (p = 0.0002). ly and g achieved 99.9% killing at 1.01 +/- 0.03 h and was more rapid (p < 0.007) than all the other regimens studied except for v and g, which achieved 99.9% killing at 3.59 +/- 0.01 h. killing curves determined with different media  against a standard inoculum of mrsa did not demonstrate a significant difference  between ly and v at 24 h. time to 99.9% killing was more rapid with ly than with  v in b, a, and s (p = 0.0002). times to 99.9% killing by ly in b, a, and s were not significantly different from each other. against vref, ly killed better than  v in b, a, or s at 24 h (p = 0.0002). ly in b was more active than ly in a or s (p = 0.0002). ly is a new potent glycopeptide with a unique activity profile. it  has a greater activity than that of v against mrsa and has activity against vref. ly demonstrated synergism in combination with gentamicin against mrsa. ly was affected by large inoculum sizes and proteins in time-kill studies. however, the  effect was compensated for by increasing the drug concentration to 16x mic.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of dz-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and mic90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively. mic90s of du-6681a  were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic50 and mic90 of du-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a  activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) cfu), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to du-6681a was less  than or equal to those of the reference compounds. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of du-6681a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae.

TI  == activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria: clinical applications and therapeutic potential.
AB  == in recent years there has been a dramatic worldwide increase in the prevalence of multiple drug-resistant strains of common gram-positive bacteria. this highlights the need for a new class of antibiotic with activity against these organisms. quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first injectable streptogramin antibiotic, has a unique spectrum of activity, encompassing most gram-positive cocci (including multi-drug-resistant strains), respiratory pathogens and anaerobes, gram-positive, and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect. quinupristin/ dalfopristin is active in vitro against multi-drug-resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. clinical case reports have shown that  the combination is active against intra-abdominal, aortic graft, bacteraemia and  hydrocephalus shunt infections caused by multi-drug-resistant enterococci, particularly e. faecium. in almost all of these clinical situations the enterococcal infection had displayed resistance to all other antimicrobial therapies. preliminary clinical data have demonstrated the activity of quinupristin/ dalfopristin against s. aureus bacteraemia, and quinupristin/dalfopristin may also prove useful in the treatment of pneumococcal  infections. thus, possible future applications of the combination include the treatment of multi-drug-resistant strains of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci. quinupristin/dalfopristin may prove useful in the treatment of staphylococcal infections in children, invasive systemic pneumococcal infections, and nosocomial and community-acquired gram-positive infections in patients unable to tolerate beta-lactam antimicrobial agents or glycopeptide antibiotics.

TI  == development of provisional disc diffusion breakpoints for testing quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is an injectable streptogramin with broad activity against many gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. although a number of studies have reported the mics of this compound against a variety of bacteria, there are no published reports of disc diffusion testing. we tested total disc masses of 7.5 and 15 micrograms with varying ratios of the component compounds, quinupristin and dalfopristin, combined in the following quinupristin: dalfopristin ratios (in microgram): 7.5:0, 0:7.5, 10:5, 5:10, 5:2.5 and 2.5:5. zone diameters and mics were determined in parallel for 44 isolates of staphylococci, 47 isolates pneumococci and 64 isolates of enterococci. control strains were included for each species tested, including a strain of enterococcus faecalis with known resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. using tentative definitions for quinupristin/dalfopristin of < or = 2 mg/l as susceptible and > or = 4 mg/l as resistant, each of the four discs containing ratios of both component compounds separated presumptive susceptible organisms from resistant ones better than either quinupristin or dalfopristin alone. the best correlation of zone sizes and mics for predicting susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin at an mic of < or = 2 mg/l was achieved with the 5 micrograms:10 micrograms disc and a zone diameter of > or = 18 mm. these criteria may be useful for identifying organisms  that are presumptively susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin.

AB  == in-vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a semisynthetic injectable streptogramin, and vancomycin were compared against multidrug-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and a methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). combinations of quinupristin/dalfopristin and/or vancomycin with ofloxacin or gentamicin were evaluated using the chequerboard technique. the only synergy observed was that between quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin plus gentamicin against e. faecium (fic index < 0.5). time-kill curves were performed over 24 h with an inoculum of 1 x 10(7) cfu/ml and clinically achievable concentrations of quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin, ofloxacin and gentamicin (6, 30, 5 and 5 mg/l, respectively). in time-kill studies, combinations of quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin and  quinupristin/dalfopristin plus gentamicin were additive, not synergic, against e. faecium and achieved 99.9% killing in 21.2 h and 19.6 h, respectively. none of the combination regimens suppressed the regrowth of e. faecalis. quinupristin/dalfopristin combined with vancomycin demonstrated consistent synergy against atcc 25923 and the mrsa, achieving 99.9% killing in 12.1 h and 11.9 h, respectively. overall, quinupristin/dalfopristin alone demonstrated inhibitory activity against e. faecium, but not against e. faecalis, and bactericidal activity was achieved only with quinupristin/dalfopristin in combination with vancomycin or gentamicin against e. faecium. quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin was the most potent and reliable combination against both strains of s. aureus in time-kill studies.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new water-soluble streptogramin antimicrobial agent comprising quinupristin and dalfopristin in a ratio of 30:70. the in-vitro  spectrum of activity includes most multi-resistant gram-positive aerobes, important gram-negative aerobes, gram-positive anaerobes and intracellular bacteria that are causal agents of respiratory, blood and cutaneous infections. of particular note, quinupristin/dalfopristin is active against multidrug-resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium, and against penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the combination is also active against staphylococci showing both constitutive and inducible erythromycin resistance. bactericidal activity and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect have also been noted for quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive cocci. gram-negative bacteria susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin include moraxella catarrhalis, legionella spp. and mycoplasma spp. overall, the spectrum of antibacterial activity indicates a potential role for this combination in the treatment of difficult-to-treat gram-positive infections, including those caused  by multidrug-resistant organisms. since this activity extends to gram-negative respiratory bacteria, quinupristin/dalfopristin may also find a role in the treatment of atypical, as well as typical, pneumonia.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == high incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units  at a university hospital in sweden.
AB  == the frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units (icus) at a university hospital in sweden was investigated annually from 1993 to  1996. an increase in ampicillin-resistant enterococci from 1993 to 1995 was seen  which was due to a shift from enterococcus faecalis to enterococcus faecium. after a special infection control programme was instituted, the rate of ampicillin resistance among enterococci and the number of e. faecium isolates declined during 1996. the oxacillin resistance rates for staphylococcus aureus were < or = 2%, while most of the coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were oxacillin resistant. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci or staphylococci were seen. the ciprofloxacin resistance rate for cns and enterococci spp. were high. relatively, high levels of resistance to cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam among enterobacter spp. were also seen. during 1995 and 1996 pseudomonas aeruginosa showed increasing resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. this was due to an outbreak among rather few patients. the overall resistance rates for gram-negative bacteria were low for aminoglycosides and imipenem. from 1993 to 1996 the total antibiotic consumption  decreased by 27% in the whole hospital and 16.5% in the icus. however, the reduced antibiotic consumption was paralleled with a 23% decrease in the total number of patients treated in the hospital from 1993 to 1996. in contrast there was an 11.5% increase in the number of icu patients treated during this period. the conclusion is that all icus within a hospital should have a programme for 'on-line' antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit in order  to change the empiric treatment when there is an increase in antibiotic resistance. it is also important to survey the antibiotic consumption in the icus in order to avoid further selective pressure on bacteria showing increased resistance rates.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. an update on current microbiological patterns.
AB  == although resistance has developed among gram-positive pathogens to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones and macrolides, the glycopeptides seem to remain largely unaffected. however, the recent emergence and range of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, well documented in the usa but not in the rest of the world, have prompted this european surveillance study. the european glycopeptide resistance survey was undertaken in 1995 in 9 countries and involved 70 microbiological centres. the primary aims of the survey were as follows: (i) to perform a microbiological quality assurance assessment to evaluate the ability of participating laboratories to correctly identify the strains and assess their  glycopeptide susceptibility; and (ii) to accurately determine the level of glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci in european hospitals. the in vitro activity of several other antibiotics was assessed on strains isolated from the italian centres. in total, 7078 gram-positive isolates were collected in europe, and national coordinators used the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) agar dilution reference method to successfully retest 96% of these. according to mode minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), teicoplanin activity was similar to that of vancomycin against staphylococcus aureus. in general, the range of mics for teicoplanin was wider than that for vancomycin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. against enterococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., teicoplanin was  4 times more active than vancomycin. the greatest number of glycopeptide refractory organisms was evident among enterococci; resistance was observed to be approximately 10 times more frequent in enterococcus faecium than in e. faecalis. the results from the italian isolates were similar to those from the overall study. in particular, teicoplanin was 2- to 8-fold more active than vancomycin against the majority of the enterococci. the incidence of enterococcal resistance was lower in italy (0.6% for teicoplanin and 0.9% for vancomycin) than in europe  (1.7% for teicoplanin and 2.3% for vancomycin). this extensive survey confirms that teicoplanin is more active than vancomycin against enterococci and streptococci, and that both display similar potency against staphylococci.

TI  == enterococci acquire new kinds of resistance.
AB  == in recent years, enterococci have become increasingly resistant to a broad range  of antimicrobial agents. the development of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, penicillins, and glycopeptides singly and in combination has important clinical implications. strains of enterococcus faecium that are resistant to every useful available antibiotic have been described. resistance to penicillin can be due to overproduction of penicillin-binding protein (which has  low affinity for penicillins) or to production of beta-lactamase. high-level resistance of enterococci to gentamicin is due to the synthesis of a modifying enzyme. in this case, the synergistic activity of the combination of penicillin with any aminoglycoside (except for streptomycin) is totally abolished. acquired  resistance to glycopeptides is often plasmid-mediated and is associated with a major epidemic potential since certain plasmids are self-transferable from e. faecium to a variety of gram-positive organisms, including staphylococcus aureus.

AB  == molecular fingerprinting techniques are rapidly becoming indispensable tools for  hospital epidemiology. on the other hand, the relative complexity and unfamiliarity of these techniques to most hospital diagnostic laboratories limit  their usefulness. in an attempt to provide a solution for this dilemma, we tested the feasibility and efficacy of a cooperative venture in which molecular typing of isolates recovered from patients in six hospitals was performed at two microbiology research laboratories with expertise in these techniques. in a small preliminary study, 30 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and 30 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) isolates were collected over a 3-week period from six hospitals in the metropolitan new york area and transported to the laboratory of microbiology at the rockefeller university during the summer months of 1994. nineteen of the 27 confirmed mrsa isolates were closely related strains carrying the same meca and the same tn554 polymorphs in a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) background represented by closely related subtypes of a single pattern, indicating the wide distribution of this mrsa clone among the participating hospitals. typing of the same 27 mrsa isolates was also performed at the tuberculosis center of the public health research institute and  identical results were obtained. the 29 confirmed vref isolates were highly heterogeneous and belonged to as many as 23 distinct clonal types as defined by pfge patterns and probing with vana. characterization of the 60 isolates by these methods was completed in one month of full-time effort by a single experienced laboratory assistant guided by a doctoral-level expert in molecular fingerprinting techniques. the collection of samples for both mrsa and vref was not intended to address epidemiological questions but to determine the feasibility of a multicenter study. on the basis of our preliminary findings we are encouraged that a larger cooperative effort is possible and with the correct  sampling method we believe that epidemiological and surveillance studies could be accomplished that would provide a tracking system to assist hospitals, clinics, and chronic care facilities in controlling the spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens.

AB  == transfer of gentamicin resistance from enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium to staphylococcus aureus, s. hyicus and s. intermedius was accomplished by filter mating. transfer from e. faecalis was plasmid mediated and a probe to the gentamicin resistance gene aac(6')-aph(2") hybridized to hindiii fragments of various sizes (7.5, 6.2 and 4.7 kbp) of these plasmids. transfer from e. faecium  was apparently to the chromosome in 9 of 10 instances with hindiii fragments of 3.3 or 3.0 kbp hybridizing to the probe. these results are consistent with transposon mediated resistance. plasmid transfers to s. intermedius were at much  lower frequencies than to s. aureus or to s. hyicus but presumed transposon transfer direct to the chromosome was equal in all three species.

TI  == semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == in vitro activity of the trinem sanfetrinem (gv104326) against gram-positive organisms.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the trinem sanfetrinem (formerly gv104326) (gv) was compared with that of vancomycin, ampicillin, and/or nafcillin against 287 gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and multiresistant enterococci, by the agar and microbroth dilution methods. gv demonstrated 2 to 16 times more activity than ampicillin and nafcillin against the majority of these organisms. the mic range of gv was 16 to 64 micrograms/ml for 19 enterococcus faecium strains that were highly resistant to ampicillin (ampicillin mic range, 64 to 512 micrograms/ml) and vancomycin resistant and 0.25 to 32 micrograms/ml for resistant rhodococcus spp. similar activities (+/-1 dilution) were observed by either the agar or the broth microdilution method. gv  demonstrated bactericidal activity against a beta-lactamase-producing enterococcus faecalis strain and against two methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains in 10(5)-cfu/ml inocula. synergy between gv and gentamicin was observed against an e. faecalis strain that lacked high-level gentamicin resistance. the activity of gv suggests this compound warrants further study.

TI  == quinupristin-dalfopristin (rp 59500): an injectable streptogramin combination.
AB  == the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, activity, and potential clinical role of quinupristin-dalfopristin (rp 59500) are described. quinupristin-dalfopristin is  the first injectable formulation of the streptogramin antibiotics. streptogramin  drug products are each composed of two chemically distinct compounds, which when  administered together act synergistically by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. quinupristin-dalfopristin has shown activity in vitro against many strains of streptococci and staphylococci, including methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant strains of staphylococci. the combination is more active against enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis. it has also shown activity in vitro against certain gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. the mean maximum blood concentration at the end of a one-hour infusion ranged from 0.95 mg/l for a 1.4-mg/kg dose to 24.2 mg/l for a 29.4-mg/kg dose; there was a linear  correlation between dose and mean area under the concentration-time curve. mean half-life ranged from 1.27 to 1.53 hours. the drug is under investigation in the  united states in phase iii trials. of 60 evaluable patients with documented bacteremia involving e. faecium resistant to vancomycin, 40 (67%) had a favorable clinical response. of 11 patients with bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 78% had a favorable response. the efficacy of quinupristin-dalfopristin in treating resistant infections has also been suggested by smaller studies and case reports. the drug may be useful in the prophylaxis of endocarditis. adverse reactions are generally mild and transient.  quinupristin-dalfopristin may be useful in treating serious gram-positive infections, but more clinical study is needed.

TI  == a highly vancomycin-resistant laboratory mutant of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == a resistant mutant with vancomycin mic of 100 micrograms/ml was isolated relatively easily through step pressure in the laboratory from a staphylococcus aureus strain with initial mic of 1.5 micrograms/ml for the antibiotic. upon addition of vancomycin (50 micrograms/ml) to the growth medium mass increase of the culture and peptidoglycan synthesis continued but cell division (daughter cell separation), cell wall turnover and autolysis were inhibited, resulting in the production of multicellular clumps of bacteria. parallel with the increase of culture density, the concentration of vancomycin measured both by biological activity and by hplc gradually declined in the culture medium. cell division and  wall turnover of the culture resumed with the production of cells of normal morphology at the time when the concentration of the drug in the medium decreased below 0.5-1.0 micrograms/ml. there was no detectable change in the antibiotic concentration in the culture medium during growth of a vancomycin-resistant (vana-positive) strain of enterococcus faecium and an intrinsically vancomycin-resistant strain of leuconostoc. the vancomycin-resistant staphylococcal mutant gave no signal with the vana or vanb dna probes and contained no detectable d-lactate terminating cell wall precursors. the biochemical mechanism and clinical significance of such glycopeptide-resistant mutants remained to be established.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

TI  == in vivo activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

TI  == comparison of antimicrobial properties of monoterpenes and their carbonylated products.
AB  == some monoterpenes and their carbonylated products were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. the carbonylation of tested monoterpenes was shown to increase the bacteriostatic and fungistatic activities specifically  by the contact method. concerning the killing effects, only (1r,2s,5r)-isopulegol, its carbonylated products, and (r)-carvone showed significant bactericidal activities, particularly against enterococcus faecium and escherichia coli above a concentration of 10 microliters/ml. a fungicidal efficiency of (1r,2s,5r)-isopulegol and (r)-carvone against aspergillus niger was also noted. it seems that the presence of an oxygenated function in the framework increases the antimicrobial properties. however, monoterpenes were more active using a micro-atmosphere method.

AB  == the etest was applied directly to 100 gram-positive bacterial strains from blood  cultures to measure their minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). results showed  100% concordance of mic data between a direct etest method and the standard etest method for streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. in addition, direct etest for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis showed 83 to 100% correlation with standard etests. these data indicate that the  etest is useful to obtain mic data on gram-positive cocci (especially streptococci) directly from positive blood cultures. the advantages of a direct etest are two fold: mic results can be obtained 24 hours earlier than standard methods and a more representative population of the bacterial isolate is tested.

AB  == the effect of methanogenesis on the survival of model bacterial strains (escherichia coli ec 5, staphylococcus aureus sa 11, enterococcus faecium ccm 4231) and non-embryonated helminth eggs (ascaris suum) was investigated in pig slurry. two pilot-plant experiments were carried out in two anaerobic digesters (800 and 1,000 litre) in a mesophilic thermal range (35-37 degrees c). the mean hydraulic retention time of the digesters was 20 days. the methanogenesis process was monitored by determining the following chemical parameters: ph, n-nh3, total  dry matter (kg/day), organic matter (kg/day) production of methane by supplied and degraded organic matter (m3/kg). the results obtained allow us to state that  the anaerobic stabilization of pig slurry in the mesophilic temperature range resulted in total devitalization of model bacterial strains e. coli ec 5 and ent. faecium ccm 4231. st. aureus sa 11 cells, exposed to the above mentioned conditions, were also reduced in their number from 10.04 to 3.27 and from 8.69 to 2.77 log cfu/ml. it is assumed that the longer retention time of excrements in the digester could also result in total devitalization of st. aureus sa 11 cells. from the microbiological point of view, the above mentioned facts indicate a sufficient hygienization effect of the anaerobic fermentation on the contaminated pig excrements. the survival of a. suum eggs was little affected by the 20-day anaerobic mesophilic digestion of pig slurry. only 17 or 18% (f1, f2) of the non-embryonated a. suum eggs were damaged after the 20-day exposure.

AB  == in 1994, microbiology laboratories of ten portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. from 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples  significant numbers of escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. were isolated. escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a great variation in resistance values of p. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. resistance to methicillin in s. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an  average of 47%, and it was even higher with s. epidermidis (c.3000) and s. haemolyticus (c.650). only vancomycin was always active against these strains. in e. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. e. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.

AB  == a chronic dialysis patient developed persistent bacteremia as a result of infection with enterococcus faecium. during the patient's illness, resistance to  ampicillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin developed. despite arteriovenous (av) graft removal and an extensive but inconclusive search for the source of the infection, bacteremia persisted. on autopsy, the patient was found  to have had aortic-valve endocarditis. endocarditis is a well-known complication  in dialysis patients. multidrug-resistant organisms are becoming more prevalent in hospitalized patients as well. risk factors for the development of endocarditis in dialysis patients include catheters, av grafts, and calcific valvular disease, all in conjunction with frequent access to the circulation. avoidance of temporary catheter use by prompt placement of av fistulas or grafts  and consideration of their early use, the meticulous care of catheters once in place, and treatment of the nasal carriage of staphylococcus aureus may lower the incidence of bacteremia and therefore endocarditis in dialysis patients. the removal of infected catheters and/or av grafts if prompt clearing of the blood with antibiotics does not occur is the next step, followed by valve replacement in selected cases. the routine use of vancomycin in the dialysis population should be reevaluated in light of the development of high-level antibiotic-resistant organisms.

AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == structure-activity relationship of new 2-substituted penem antibiotics.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of three new penems with 4-hydroxyprolinamide, 1-prolinamide and n-methyl-n-2-propionamide substituents, respectively, in position 2 and of their stereoisomers were examined against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all substitutes conferred a broad antibacterial spectrum  on the penem moiety. changes in stereoisomerism selectively improved the activity against e. coli, s. aureus or enterococci. the structure-activity relationships of each compound were discussed in relation to minimum inhibitory concentrations, penicillin-binding protein (pbp) affinity and outer membrane permeability coefficient in e. coli. in this microorganism, pbp 2 was the target for all compounds. changes in stereoisomerism influenced the affinity for pbps 1a/b and 2. all antibiotics easily permeated the outer membrane of e. coli and, within each group of compounds, the penetration rate correlated with the antibacterial activity.

TI  == [the end of antibiotics? increasing bacterial resistance in global and norwegian  perspective].
AB  == during the last 20 years there has emerged a growing world-wide problem with regard to multidrug-resistant microbes. the most serious examples so far are vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium, totally resistant isolates  of mycobacterium tuberculosis and multiple-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. with the exception of some few strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, such bacteria have not been found in norway. in this article we discuss possible ways  of preventing further selection and spread of multiple-resistant microbes. we stress the importance of infection control programmes and restrictive use of antibiotics.

TI  == susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to glycopeptides comparison of 3  test methods.
AB  == the significance of grampositive bacteria, especially staphylococci and enterococci, as nosocomial pathogens has increased in the last decade. furthermore, resistance to commonly used antibiotics like beta-lactams has also become more common and even resistance to glycopeptides has been observed. we evaluated the susceptibility of 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates (52 s. epidermidis, 52 s. haemolyticus, 10 s. saprophyticus, 10 s. hominis, 4 s. warneri, 4 s. simulans, 4 s. capitis and 14 s. aureus) and of 50 enterococci (49  e. faecalis, 1 e. faecium) to the glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin. the  data from the agar dilution test used as reference method were compared with the  results from the e test and the agar disk diffusion test. concerning vancomycin,  no resistance among all the staphylococcal isolates was observed whereas one single enterococcal strain (e. faecium) proved to be resistant. the overall resistance of staphylococcal isolates against teicoplanin was about 10.7% (15 s.  haemolyticus, 1 s. epidermidis) being mainly due to the high proportion of s. haemolyticus strains (52 out of 150) among the staphylococcal isolates. teicoplanin resistance among the enterococci was not detected. for vancomycin, a  very close correlation between the mics from the agar dilution test and the e test was noticed. as concerns teicoplanin, the mics from the e-test were usually  somewhat lower than those obtained by the agar dilution test. no correlation was  found between the mics of resistant and intermediate staphylococcal strains and the results from the teicoplanin agar disk diffusion test. for routine teicoplanin susceptibility testing of staphylococci, the determination of the mic (e.g., by the e test) is much more reliable for detecting resistant strains than  the agar disk diffusion test.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. cs-940 activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s)  of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml). cs-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp. (mic90s, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 was two- to eightfold  more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. cs-940 was also very active against streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which mic90s were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecium, however, the mic90 was 4 micrograms/ml. cs-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. this compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == conjugative mobilization of a vancomycin resistance plasmid by a putative enterococcus faecium sex pheromone response plasmid.
AB  == recent epidemiological evidence suggests that horizontal gene transfer may be an  important mechanism for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. a filter mating survey of 21 vana enterococcus faecium isolates from the new york hospital showed that 14 of these isolates transferred vancomycin resistance (vmr) to the plasmid-free reference strain enterococcus faecalis jh2-2. one isolate, e. faecium r7, was selected for further study based on its ability to transfer vmr to strain jh2-2 in liquid culture. analysis of the plasmid content of transconjugants revealed three general classes. the predominant class (28 of 47 transconjugants) contained two separate plasmids: phkk702 and phkk703. phkk702 is a 41-kb plasmid that contains an element indistinguishable from the vmr transposon tn1546 and an element that hybridizes with an ermb probe from the staphylococcus aureus erythromycin resistance transposon tn551. phkk703 is a 55-kb plasmid that hybridizes with probes for the sex pheromone response genes prga, prgb, and prgx derived from the e. faecalis plasmid pcf10. the second group of transconjugants (18 of 47) contained various recombinant forms of phkk702 and  phkk703, whereas a third transconjugant class contained only phkk702 (1 of 47). transconjugants that contained both phkk702 and phkk703 were able to efficiently  transfer vmr to recipient strains in broth or on filters. however, no transfer of vmr was detected using the donor containing only phkk702. the transfer of vmr from the recombination-deficient derivative of e. faecalis jh2-2 [strain uv202(phkk702, phkk703)] was reduced 600-fold compared to that of jh2-2(phkk702,  phkk703). we propose that phkk703 functions as an e. faecium sex pheromone response plasmid that conjugatively mobilizes phkk702, and that a major pathway for this mobilization may require donor-mediated recombination proficiency. this  report provides the first example in which a plasmid containing a tn1546-related  element is conjugatively mobilized.

TI  == new threats to the control of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == several countries have achieved considerable success in the control of epidemic methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). however, in several hospitals in the uk, mrsa strains of enhanced epidemicity, notably emrsa-16, are becoming endemic. our inability to eliminate the cause of a single-strain outbreak is unfamiliar and unnerving. factors in 'market-led' health care delivery that hinder control of mrsa include a shortage of inpatient beds, patients moving from ward to ward, and more mixed-specialty wards. increasing use of day treatments leaves an inpatient hospital population with more risk factors for infection. early discharge of infected patients to convalescent homes, or to homes for the elderly, has created a new reservoir of infected and colonized patients. the emergence of high-level mupirocin resistance may soon also contribute to failure  of control. the transfer of vancomycin resistance from enterococcus faecium to a  laboratory strain of s. aureus suggests that, especially in hospitals with both vancomycin-resistant enterococci and mrsa, there is the opportunity for the emergence of vancomycin-resistant mrsa for which there may be no effective antimicrobial prophylaxis or treatment. it is increasingly important to persuade  hospital managers that even partial control of mrsa, whilst expensive, is still cost-effective and is a quality issue for individual hospitals. the control of emrsa-16 in one hospital has recently been estimated to have saved more than 629,000 pounds extra costs. mrsa continues to be at the forefront of those organisms that seriously challenge modern technological medicine and surgery.

TI  == efficacies of abt-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. these compounds are potent bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors  which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring  juncture. abt-719 is an s isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. abt-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. abt-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the racemate and r forms of abt-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. the 50% effective doses of abt-719 were at least threefold  lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused  by salmonella typhimurium or listeria monocytogenes. in immunosuppressed mice, abt-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. the pharmacokinetic properties of abt-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. the 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.

TI  == [microbial resistance to formaldehyde. iii> dependence of the microbial effect on staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium and spores of bacillus stearothermophilus on temperature].
AB  == temperature dependence of microbicidal efficacy of formaldehyde was examined with suspension tests (ph 7.0). test germs were staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium and spores of bacillus stearothermophilus. the methodology was nearly the same as in previous investigations (5, 7). at given exposure periods and temperatures formaldehyde concentrations necessary to produce a microbicidal effect of log (n/n0) = -4.0 (concentrations of equal efficacy) were determined. n and n0 represent the numbers of colony-forming units in suspensions with and without formaldehyde, respectively. on rectangular graphic representation with the reciprocal value of absolute temperature on the abscissa and with the logarithm of the formaldehyde concentration on the ordinate, the formaldehyde concentrations of equal efficacy fitted straight lines. lines referring to different exposure periods nearly paralleled each other. with increasing exposure periods the steepness of the lines decreased slightly. this effect was most pronounced with staphylococcus aureus as a test germ. the ratio of formaldehyde concentrations of equal efficacy for exposure periods of 120 minutes at 20 degrees c and 30 degrees c, respectively, was 3.1:1 with staphylococcus aureus, and 2.8:1 with enterococcus faecium. the corresponding ratio obtained with spores of bacillus stearothermophilus and referring to 60 degrees c and 70 degrees c, respectively, was 3.6:1. the logarithms of these ratios decreased with temperature in the same measure as the pertinent absolute temperatures increased. on the basis of the previously presented three-dimensional model of the relations between concentration, period of action and efficacy of microbicidal agents, it could be shown that deviations of the results from a linear and parallel course reflect an inconstant concentration exponent. when low formaldehyde concentration, long exposure period and "high" temperature coincide, the efficacy of formaldehyde is lower than calculated for a linear and parallel course of the  relation.

TI  == heterogeneity of the vana gene cluster in clinical isolates of enterococci from the northeastern united states.
AB  == in several strains of enterococcus faecium isolated in europe, the cluster of genes encoding high-level resistance to vancomycin (vana phenotype) resides on a  10.85-kb transposon, tn1546, or closely related elements. to determine whether tn1546 was conserved in recent enterococcal isolates from the northeastern united states, seven strains were compared by restriction mapping and dna hybridization  with probes from within the van cluster. two of the seven strains contained intact tn1546-like sequences; however, in five of the strains, the organization of the van cluster differed from that of tn1546. three of the five strains with variations harbored a novel dna segment within the van gene cluster. this 1,496-bp segment was similar to is1165 of leuconostoc mesenteroides and is1181 of staphylococcus aureus and was flanked by 24- and 23-bp imperfect inverted repeats and 8-bp direct repeats. on the basis of these findings, we propose that this element comprises a novel insertion-like sequence, is1251. multiple copies of is1251 were also present at other sites in both resistant and susceptible clinical isolates. our findings suggest that the van cluster in recent isolates from the northeastern united states differs from that present in the early european vana phenotype strains.

AB  == mechanisms of resistance of strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, neisseria meningitidis and mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. the resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in s. aureus and s. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of dna, namely by gene meca. this gene codes altered pbp-2a protein. strains of s.pneumoniae contain pbp-1a, pbp-2b and pbp-2x proteins. they cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of  e. faecalis and e. faecium is coded by transferable vana and vanb genes. strains  of n. meningitidis produce mostly the altered pbp-2 protein. the increase of resistance in strains of m. tuberculosis is also significant.

AB  == recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high  incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. at first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of dna extraction. n-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract  dna from e. faecalis, e. faecium and s. aureus, respectively. after achromopeptidase extraction, the meca gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in clinically isolated mrsa (95 strains), mssa (66), mrse (methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 37), msse (methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis, 1), s haemolyticus(5), s.hominis(1) and others (enterococcus, pseudomonas, and streptococcus, total 45). pcr products were analyzed by agarose  gel electrophoresis. the positive rates were 95% (mrsa), 1.5% (mssa), and 97% (mrse). the meca gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant s.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive s.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.hominis. the meca gene was not detected in 45 non-staphylococcal strains. meca and fema gene by pcr and pbp 2' by irma were further detected in newly isolated mrsa (20 strains), mssa(20), mrse(14), msse(1) and s.simulans(2). complete correlation between mpipc susceptibility and meca were found. the fema gene was positive in 39/40 of s. aureus, and 0/14 of s.epidermidis, 2/3 of s.simulans. pbp2' were positive in 20/20 of mrsa, 0/20 of mssa, 14/14 of mrse, 0/1 of msse, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive s.simulans. in conclusion, diagnoses of mrsa by simultaneous detection of meca and fema gene as well as pbp2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.

TI  == identification of gram positive cocci isolated from urine.
AB  == a total of 195 strains of gram positive cocci isolated from urine, in pure culture and in counts of > 10(3) colony forming units/ml, during january-september 1992, were speciated using schema recently described by facklam and washington, and kloos and lambe. seventy three (85%) of the 86 enterococci were identified as enterococcus faecalis while 11 (13%) were e. faecium. eighteen (29%) of the 62 staphylococcal isolates were staphylococcus aureus; 20 (45%) of the 44 coagulase negative staphylococci were speciated as staph. haemolyticus. of the 47 strains of beta haemolytic streptococci isolated, 45 (96%) were group b; one was group g and the other group f. our results show the diverse species of gram positive cocci associated with bacteriuria and the need to speciate them in  a diagnostic laboratory. in the context of a larger number of tests required for  the speciation of gram positive cocci, we recommend a simplified scheme which we  found feasible on a routine basis.

AB  == the bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. in first examinations (i. communication) (19)  the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of  different microorganisms (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined  exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). the following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. in this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. the bactericide effect on micrococcus luteus and pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. this results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces  of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.

AB  == the in vitro activities of two glycylcyclines, cl 329,998 and cl 331,002 (two new semisynthetic tetracyclines), were evaluated in comparison with those of tetracycline and other available oral antimicrobial agents. a total of 523 recent clinical isolates were studied, including strains resistant to tetracycline. members of the family enterobacteriaceae were generally > or = 16-fold more susceptible to the glycylcyclines than to tetracycline (although less difference  was seen with proteus spp.). pseudomonas aeruginosa was modestly susceptible to both new compounds (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90], 16 micrograms/ml). tetracycline- and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus were all susceptible to the glycylcyclines (mic90 < or = 1  microgram/ml). streptococci (including streptococcus pneumoniae) and enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium displayed a bimodal distribution of susceptibility to tetracycline yet were uniformly susceptible to the glycylcyclines (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). the glycylcyclines were highly potent against neisseria, moraxella, haemophilus, and bacteroides spp. (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). strains of chlamydia spp. (three c. trachomatis strains and one c. pneumoniae strain) were inhibited by < or = 0.25 microgram of cl 329,998 or cl 331,002 per ml. two strains of mycoplasma pneumoniae were inhibited by < or = 0.12 microgram of cl 331,002 per ml and by 1 microgram of cl 329,998 per ml. mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium avium were resistant to the  two glycylcyclines (mic > or = 8 micrograms/ml). these results indicate that the  two glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria.

(b) catarrhalis and h. influenzae were better than those of flrx and lflx. spfx showed the highest activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. however, strains showed high mic (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to spfx were found among mrsa,  e. faecalis, and e. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. the results of this study suggest that resistant strains of gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.

TI  == potentiation of antibiotic activity by edta-tromethamine against three clinically isolated gram-positive resistant bacteria. an in vitro investigation.
AB  == the in vitro synergistic effects of combinations of edta-tromethamine and five antimicrobial agents (ampicillin, cephalexin, oxytetracycline, streptomycin and sulphadimethoxine) on three clinically isolated gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and streptococcus faecium) were investigated. the bacteria had been isolated from three cases of canine otitis resistant to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration for the antibiotics alone or in combination with edta-tromethamine. edta-tromethamine potentiated the activity of cefalexin against s. aureus and s. hominis, of oxytetracycline against s. aureus and s. faecium and of streptomycin against s. faecium. no significant effects were noted on the activity of oxytetracycline against s. hominis. the remaining combinations gave a slight synergistic effect. as previously shown for gram-negative resistant bacteria, these data suggest that the association of edta-tromethamine and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be useful to overcome persistent infections of soft tissues in domestic animals.

AB  == n,n-dimethylglycylamido (dmg) derivatives of minocycline and 6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline are new semisynthetic tetracyclines referred to as the glycylcyclines. the in vitro activities of the glycylcyclines were evaluated  in comparison with those of minocycline and tetracycline against strains carrying characterized tetracycline resistance determinants and against 995 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers in north  america. the glycylcyclines were active against tetracycline-resistant strains carrying efflux [tet(a), tet(b), tet(c), and tet(d) in escherichia coli and tet(k) in staphylococcus aureus] and ribosomal protection [tet(m) in s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and e. coli)] resistance determinants. potent activity (mic for 90% of strains, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) was obtained with the glycylcyclines against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, e. faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and various streptococcal species. the glycylcyclines exhibited good activity against a wide diversity of gram-negative  aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, most of which were less susceptible to minocycline and tetracycline. the activities of the glycylcyclines against most organisms tested were comparable to each other. the in vivo efficacies of the glycylcyclines against acute lethal infections in mice when dosed intravenously were reflective of their in vitro activities. the glycylcyclines had efficacies comparable to that of minocycline against infections with methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, a strain carrying tet(k), and a tetracycline-susceptible e. coli strain but exceeded the effectiveness of minocycline against infections with resistant isolates, including strains harboring tet(m) or tet(b). levels of dmg-6-deoxytetracycline in serum were higher and more sustained than those of dmg-minocycline or minocycline. our results show that the glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including many resistant strains. on the basis of their in vitro and in vivo activities, the glycylcyclines represent a significant advance to the tetracycline class of antibiotics and have good potential value for clinical efficacy.

AB  == enterococcus faecium bm4145, a clinical isolate from urine, was resistant to streptogramin group a antibiotics by inactivation. the strain harbored a plasmid  containing a gene, sata, responsible for this resistance; this gene was cloned and sequenced. it encoded sata, a protein deduced to be 23,634 da in mass and homologous with a new family of chloramphenicol acetyltransferases described in agrobacterium tumefaciens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. the similarity of sata to other acetyltransferases, laca (thiogalactoside acetyltransferase) and cyse (serine acetyltransferase) from e. coli, and to two putative acetyltransferases, nodl from rhizobium leguminosarum and urf1 from e. coli, was also observed in a region considered to be the enzyme's active site. acetylation experiments indicated that acetyl coenzyme a was necessary for sata activity and that a single acetylated derivative of pristinamycin iia was produced. other members of the streptogramin a group such as virginiamycin m and rp54476 were also substrates for the enzyme. we conclude that resistance to the streptogramin a group of antibiotics in e. faecium bm4145  is due to acetylation by an enzyme related to the novel chloramphenicol acetyltransferase family.

TI  == diagnosis and treatment of enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  == enterococci are frequently encountered in urinary, biliary, and gastrointestinal  tract infections and are increasingly being recognized in nosocomial bacteriuria  and bacteremia. undoubtedly, however, the most serious of all enterococcal infections is endocarditis. at present, enterococci are the third most common cause of infective endocarditis (after streptococci and staphylococcus aureus), and the incidence of the disease is likely to grow as the population ages and increasing numbers of persons are placed at risk by degenerative valve disease and by predisposition to enterococcal infections through portals such as the genitourinary tract. the case presented here exemplifies many features of enterococcal endocarditis. it also illustrates the therapeutic issues and dilemmas faced in managing this disorder. although a transesophageal approach (figure 1) has increased the sensitivity of echocardiography for detecting valvular abnormalities in infective endocarditis, diagnosis continues to rely on  blood cultures--which raises the question of how long antimicrobial therapy should be delayed for collection of blood samples. since enterococcal isolates are often resistant to antibiotics, therapy is based on synergistic drug combinations.

AB  == there is and has been continued change in organisms causing infection in the hospital. in the past few years, although gram-negative bacteria have remained a  major cause of mortality, gram-positive bacteria and fungi have become increasingly important. this has caused organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, xanthomonas maltophilia and multiply resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa to be common pathogens. can this difficult state of affairs be changed by better antimicrobial prescribing practices? yes and no. virtually any agent will select mrsa and mrse since the chromosomal location of the resistance of multiple-antibiotics makes such selection common and explains the rapid rate of the fluoroquinolones as therapy of mrsa. restriction of oral vancomycin will markedly reduce the pressure to select enterococcus faecium and thus limit the spread of the organisms and delay transmission of glycopeptide resistance to s. aureus. judicious use of antibiotics in the intensive care environment will be major factor in "saving" antibiotics for other patients since the icu patient goes to other parts of the hospital carrying with him/her the baggage of resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, klebsiella, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter, xanthomonas and pseudomonas cepacia. all of these organisms have the potential to become resistant to the agents heretofore used to treat them and are common in icu patients.

TI  == occurrence and mechanisms of glycopeptide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  == despite belief that the unique mechanism of glycopeptide action would preclude the development of resistance in susceptible organisms, clinical isolates of enterococci and staphylococci resistant to these compounds have been described. among the enterococci, there are at least three types of resistance. type a (high-level) resistance was described in enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis. it is inducible and mediated by elaboration and/or increased activity of at least three enzymes: a ligase, a dehydrogenase, and a carboxypeptidase, which orchestrate the production of peptidoglycan precursors that do not bind vancomycin. type b (low-level) resistance described in e. faecium is also mediated by increased carboxypeptidase activity and, possibly, by elaboration of  a protein detectable after incubation in vancomycin whose function is unknown. type c resistance is associated with production of a ligase constitutively produced, chromosomally encoded, and unique to e. gallinarum. among the staphylococci, coagulase-negative clinical isolates were obtained that were resistant to glycopeptides and one coagulase-positive isolate was resistant to teicoplanin but the mechanism of resistance is unknown. additionally, coagulase-positive staphylococci resistant to glycopeptides have been prepared in the laboratory. they produce an approximately 39-kda cytoplasmic protein, whose function is unknown, and have undergone extensive reorganization of their cell surface. the era in which universal gram-positive susceptibility to glycopeptides can be presumed is over; susceptibility testing must now accompany isolation of an enterococcus or staphylococcus of clinical importance.

TI  == [the effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  == some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. staphylococcus cohnii sc7, staphylococcus sp. ztj 151, s. saprophyticus ss 877, enterococcus faecium ef1 and e. faecalis efg2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves  and fallow deer, enterococcus gallinarum eg10 and e. avium ea12 were isolated from the caecum of japanese quail. the tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and  urease activity (tab. iii). these culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and vl agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (zag, zal, vlg, vll), agar for isolation  of faecal streptococci (sa) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (ka4, ka2). the strains streptococcus bovis ao 24/85 and staphylococcus aureus oxford 209 p were used as indicator bacteria. tables i and ii show the results of these  tests. the tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on sa medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. on zag medium, the zones of enterococci with the ao 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. all strains with the 209p indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. the larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the zal medium with the ao24/85 strain. the production of tested strains was balanced on vlg agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [a comparative microbiological and pharmacokinetic activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin].
AB  == vancomycin and teicoplanin are two commercially available glycopeptide antibiotics. they have identical spectra of activity and similar mechanisms of action, and both are complex molecules. in vitro, vancomycin is more active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, while teicoplanin is more active against enterococci and pneumococci. the activity of the two antibiotics against  staphylococcus aureus is similar. the serum pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and teicoplanin are highly different, teicoplanin having a longer elimination half-life (40 hours versus 6-8 hours for vancomycin), but a higher degree of protein binding (90% versus 55%). we compared the two antibiotics on the basis of their inhibitory quotient kinetics, using the mic90 values for the above bacterial species as the microbiological parameters, and the total and free (non-protein bound) serum concentrations as the pharmacokinetic parameters. the inhibitory quotient kinetics of vancomycin were always more favorable in terms of the free concentrations, even against those bacteria for which the teicoplanin mic was lower.

TI  == evaluation of the e test by using selected gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the e test (ab biodisk na inc.) was compared with standard reference methods using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards's recommendations  for determining the mics of four selected antibiotics against 208 clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria. these bacteria included 32 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 25 strains of enterococcus faecium, 20 strains of oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (ossa), 96 strains of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (orsa), and 35 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci. evaluation included mic accuracy within 1 dilution, reproducibility testing, and cost analysis. there was 94% agreement between the e test and the reference method in testing s. pneumoniae and penicillin g. there was 92% agreement with ampicillin and 100% agreement with vancomycin in testing e. faecium isolates. accuracy of the oxacillin e test with staphylococci was significantly improved by the use of salt-supplemented mueller-hinton agar, for an agreement of 100% with coagulase-negative staphylococci and oxacillin-sensitive s. aureus and that of 85% with oxacillin-resistant s. aureus, with no major discrepancies. the e test with american type culture collection isolates and clinical strains gave excellent reproducibility and was less costly  than microdilution panels when used to test fewer than three antibiotics. the e test is a simple, reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective method for mic determination for gram-positive organisms.

TI  == the activity of metal compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two metal compounds, jm-1397 (oso2[xylyl]2) and jm-2469 (aucl[s2cpet3]). both inhibited methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus at concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) of 1 microgram/ml for jm-1397 and 0.5 microgram/ml for jm-2469. similar concentrations inhibited methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus). jm-2469 inhibited group a, b, c, f, and g beta-hemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci at 1-8 micrograms/ml (mic90 4 micrograms/ml) but enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml. jm-1397 had mics for these organisms of greater than 64 micrograms/ml. bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides, and clostridium species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.12-4 micrograms/ml (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). mics of both compounds for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. were greater than 64 micrograms/ml. these studies show that osmium and gold compounds have potential as topical agents against gram-positive and anaerobic species.

TI  == in vitro activity of decaplanin (m86-1410), a new glycopeptide antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro activity of decaplanin (formerly m86-1410), a novel glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, was tested against 169 gram-positive bloodstream isolates from patients at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics and 12 selected vancomycin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, bacilli, corynebacteria, and listeria were inhibited by decaplanin (mics for 90% of the strains tested [mic90s], 0.12 to 4 micrograms/ml). however, some rarely isolated and selected enterococcus sp. populations had a mic90 of 16 micrograms/ml, and s. haemolyticus strains had a mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml. these in vitro results suggest that decaplanin may be useful against most gram-positive strains, even though some enterococcus species  and coagulase-negative staphylococci were potentially resistant (mics, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml).

TI  == small and medium-angle x-ray analysis of bacterial lipoteichoic acid phase structure.
AB  == x-ray scattering analysis was performed on various types of bacterial lipoteichoic acid in solution. the x-ray data show that all samples investigated  were characterized by a similar micellar ultrastructure (hydrophilic moiety on the outside) with a fatty acid chain conformation of the disordered, alpha-type at all temperatures between 5 degrees-53 degrees c. the size distribution of staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid micelles was sufficiently homogeneous to  determine their size and some related molecular parameters by detailed small-angle x-ray scattering analysis. nearly independent of the degree of d-alanine substitution and the ionic strength of the aqueous dispersion, an average micelle contained about 150 lipoteichoic acid molecules arranged in a spherical assembly with a diameter of about 22 nm, whereby the hydrophilic region occupied an outer shell of about 8.5 nm thickness. based on the average chain length of lipoteichoic acid, it could be estimated that each glycerophosphate residue contributed by about 0.34 nm to the thickness of the hydrophilic shell as compared to a theoretical value of approximately 0.8 nm for a fully extended chain conformation, indicating a highly coiled conformation of the hydrophilic chain. the bearing of these findings on the properties of membrane-associated and secreted lipoteichoic acids is discussed.

TI  == biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

(415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [the effect of roxithromycin on the aerobic fecal flora in children].
AB  == to evaluate the effect of roxithromycin on aerobic flora in 14 children treated orally (5 mg/kg/day during 5 to 7 days) quantitative stool cultures were performed using selective media. enterobacteriaceae (eb), streptococci d (str d), staphylococcus aureus, candida were counted at days 0, 2 and 5 days, and 2 days after treatment. the mic of each strain was determined for roxithromycin, erythromycin and spiramycin. ten infants in a nursery had already received antibiotics. a moderate albeit significant (p less than 0.01) decrease was observed for eb, falling from 7.2 log 10 (range 5-9) to 4.9 (range 2-8) per gram  of stools, rising to 5.8 after treatment. there was no significant effect for str d. the mic of roxithromycin for eb increased from 244 mg/l (range 0.03-512) to 340 (range 0.03-512). for str. d, it increased from 138 (range 1-1024) to 427 (range 1-1024). the bacteria with low mic (less than or equal to 64 mg/l for eb and less than or equal to 4 mg/l for str. d) are escherichia coli and streptococcus faecium. the mic increased for the three macrolides tested.

TI  == the enterococci: evidence of species-specific clinical and microbiologic heterogeneity.
AB  == investigations of the clinical role of enterococci have been limited largely to enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis and have not distinguished between the various species of enterococci. to characterize the full spectrum of enterococcal disease and to determine whether clinically important differences exist among infections and/or instances of colonization (infections/colonizations) by the various enterococcal species, cases of enterococcal infection/colonization diagnosed at the dallas veterans administration medical center (dvamc) in 1986 were reviewed. during this period, 220 enterococcus faecalis, 21 enterococcus faecium, 12 enterococcus avium, and no enterococcus durans isolates were identified in clinical specimens (other than stool) submitted to the dvamc microbiology laboratory. clinical characteristics of cases of infection/colonization by the three species of enterococci were similar and did not vary significantly when blood stream invasion occurred. nevertheless, mortality data and therapeutic response rates suggested differences in virulence  of the three enterococcal species. enterococcal infections/colonizations (including bacteremia) frequently were polymicrobial. although enterobacteriaceae were the most common copathogens identified overall, staphylococcus aureus was the most common copathogen in bloodstream infections. e. avium was more resistant than e. faecalis or e. faecium to penicillin g and ampicillin and less resistant  to most other antimicrobial agents. the results of this investigation suggest that enterococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that should not be treated as a single entity in clinical investigations.

TI  == transferable vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance in enterococcus faecium.
AB  == enterococcus faecium bm4165 and bm4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (ly146032). strain bm4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin b-type (mls) antibiotics. the genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to mls antibiotics in strain bm4165 were carried  on plasmids pip819 and pip821, respectively; pip819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to mls antibiotics. the two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other e. faecium strains. plasmid pip819 could also conjugate to e. faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, s. pyogenes, s. lactis, and listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to s. aureus. glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.

TI  == [role of enterococcus faecium sf 68 in experimental infection in mice].
AB  == the normal intestinal flora is an important defence against various infectious agents. it also allows important metabolic stages in the host. the authors studied the ability of enterococcus faecium sf 68 to protect the mice (swiss strain) from infection by salmonella typhi and its role when used with penicillin in infection by staphylococcus aureus. our results showed that sf 68, determined  a good protection against infection. moreover the association e. faecium sf 68-antibiotic lowers the mortality rate in the infected mice compared with the control group.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  == we have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. in-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. although pristinamycin's mean mic for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (mic greater than or equal to  3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less  than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin showed poor activity against haemophilus influenzae (mode mic 1.56 and mic90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin inhibited all nine clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. it was less effective against the bacteroides fragilis group: (mic90 3.12 mg/l). pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.

TI  == in vitro selection of bacteria resistant to ly146032, a new cyclic lipopeptide.
AB  == isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci were investigated for their abilities, in vitro, to develop resistance to ly146032. exposure of the organisms to incremental concentrations of ly146032 resulted in mics 8- to 32-fold higher than those for the original isolates. after three passages on antibiotic-free medium, the high mics were maintained for the coagulase-negative  staphylococci and pneumococci, with a twofold decrease observed for the enterococci and a fourfold decrease observed for staphylococcus aureus. the frequency of spontaneous emergence of resistance was highest with s. pneumoniae (1.2 x 10(-6) at 16 times the original mic) and lowest with s. aureus (7.0 x 10(-10) at 8 times the original mic). for bacteria for bacteria surviving time-kill studies mics were also higher than were those for the original isolates. exposure to ly146032 in vitro selected for strains with decreased susceptibilities to the antimicrobial agent. however, the emergence of resistance in vivo is unpredictable and can be evaluated only after prolonged clinical use of the drug.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ly146032 (daptomycin) against gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ly146032 was compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive cocci. mics of ly146032 were lowest for streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (0.25 mg/l). for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus the mics were 1 mg/l, for enterococcus faecalis 2 mg/l and  for enterococcus faecium 4 mg/l. the activity of ly146032 was in general higher than that of vancomycin. time-kill studies showed ly146032 had higher bactericidal activity than vancomycin against a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strain, and bactericidal activity against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly146032 (daptomycin) against selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new lipopeptide antibiotic ly146032 was generally four-fold greater (mic 90 less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml) than that of vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative species of staphylococcus. enterococci, streptococcus bovis, group b and viridans streptococci, and corynebacterium group j-k isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of ly146032, which represented activity equivalent to or greater than that of vancomycin. unlike vancomycin, ly146032 was bactericidal for enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and listeria monocytogenes. due to its bactericidal properties ly146032 appeared to represent an improvement over vancomycin and teicoplanin.

TI  == dispersal of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance gene in streptococcal and enterococcal plasmids.
AB  == plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups a, b, and g, ten from enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the  chloramphenicol resistance gene of pip501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group b streptococcus. the 6.3-kb hindiii fragment of pip501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pbr322. a 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in dna-dna hybridization experiments. sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. the absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group b streptococcus, as well as three isolated from e. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants  in the streptococci and in the enterococci.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cam373) also produced by staphylococcus aureus and identification of a conjugative transposon (tn918).
AB  == streptococcus faecalis rc73 was found to harbor a conjugative plasmid (pam373) which confers a mating response to a sex pheromone (cam373) excreted by plasmid-free members of the same species. the pheromone was also detected in culture filtrates of all of 23 staphylococcus aureus strains but in only 2 of 22  coagulase negative staphylococcus strains. streptococcus sanguis challis and g9b  also produced the activity, but 10 other streptococcus sanguis strains did not. the activity was also produced by streptococcus faecium 9790. a tetracycline resistance (tc) determinant present in s. faecalis rc73 was not associated with pam373 but served as a useful marker in efforts to identify pam373 among other plasmids present in the strain. analyses of the tc determinant showed that it was located on a conjugative transposon very similar to tn916. designated tn918, the  transposon could insert into pam373 as well as into two other hemolysin plasmids. whereas pam373 derivatives transferred very well between strains of streptococcus faecalis, the plasmid would not establish in staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus sanguis. however, a derivative of pam373 carrying tn918 proved to be a useful delivery vehicle for generating transposon insertions into multiple sites on the staphylococcal chromosome.

TI  == effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth (bbl). some of the effectors, e.g., streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, lactobacillus lactis, l. brevis, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of s. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most  cultures were inhibitory, and some (s. faecium and l. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the staphylococcus. low-temperature meat lactobacilli and leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited s. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 c throughout its growth. streptococcus  faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 c, as well. when the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat lactobacillus, and l. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 c, and all but the meat lactobacillus did so at 22 c. a ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 c, except that s. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by s. faecalis. a ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. in general, the more effector bacteria there were  in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of s. aureus. inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 c, less so at 20 or 25 c, and least at 30 or 37 c, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of s. aureus were similar, for the most part.
