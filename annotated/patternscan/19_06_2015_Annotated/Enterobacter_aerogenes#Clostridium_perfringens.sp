TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of cote d'ivoire.
AB  == the distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in cote d'ivoire, and their roles in the food  poisoning were evaluated. microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella, bacillus spores, fungi and clostridium perfringens. the results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5)  to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) cfu g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged,  respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) cfu g(-1) and 1.3  +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) cfu g(-1). bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundi, enterobacter amnigenus, citrobacter youngae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter agglomerans and klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and rhizopus spp., mucor spp., thamnidium spp., fusarium spp., moniliella spp. the fungi. escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens and salmonella spp. were not found. the occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in cote d'ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct haccp system during the production. attieke is especially a well-known product in west africa; hence, it  is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == microbial partitioning to settleable particles in stormwater.
AB  == the degree to which microbes in the water column associate with settleable particles has important implications for microbial transport in receiving waters, as well as for microbial removal via sedimentation (i.e. detention basins). the partitioning behavior of several bacterial, protozoan and viral indicator organisms is explored in three urban streams under both storm and dry weather conditions. the fraction of organisms associated with settleable particles in stormwater is estimated through use of a centrifugation technique which is calibrated using suspensions of standard particles (e.g., glass, latex). the fraction of organisms associated with settleable particles varies by type of microbe, and the partitioning behavior of each organism generally changes between dry weather and storm conditions. bacterial indicator organisms (fecal coliforms, escherichia coli, enterococci) exhibited relatively consistent behavior, with an  average of 20-35% of organisms associated with these particles in background samples and 30-55% in storm samples. clostridium perfringens spores exhibited the highest average level of particle association, with storm values varying from 50% to 70%. results related to total coliphage partitioning were more variable, with  20-60% associated with particles during storms. these estimates should be valuable in surface water quality modeling efforts, many of which currently assume that all microbes exist as free (unattached) organisms.

TI  == cefamandole-erythromycin-heparin peritoneal irrigation: an adjunct to the surgical treatment of diffuse bacterial peritonitis.
AB  == the enthusiasm for the use of peritoneal irrigation has waxed and waned since its introduction by dr. pierce in 1905. the purpose of this study was to devise a relatively low-cost irrigant that could be used for continuous intraperitoneal lavage, with the intent of decreasing abscess formation following surgical treatment for generalized bacterial peritonitis. a solution of 1 l of normal saline containing 50 mg erythromycin, 50 mg cefamandole, 500 u heparin, and 5 meq kcl was proven in in vitro studies to be bactericidal to peptococcus anaerobius and clostridium perfringens, and bacteriostatic to klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis. in a prospective study 50 patients underwent peritoneal lavage with 36  l over 2 days. no lavage patients developed intraabdominal abscesses. in a control group of 44 patients seven patients (15.9%) developed postoperative abscesses.

TI  == histamine-producing bacteria in decomposing skipjack tuna (katsuwonus pelamis).
AB  == spoilage in skipjack tuna (katsuwonus pelamis) was studied under controlled conditions by incubating whole, fresh fish in seawater at 38 degrees c, the optimum temperature for histamine formation. bacterial isolates were obtained from the loin tissue of a decomposing tuna containing 134 mg of histamine per 100 g and a total anaerobic count of 3.5 x 10(5)/g after incubation for 24 h. over 92% of the 134 isolates obtained were facultatively or obligately anaerobic bacteria. eighteen isolates produced histamine in culture media containing histidine, and these were identified as clostridium perfringens, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and vibrio alginolyticus. histidine decarboxylase activity of several isolates was measured in a tuna broth medium and with resting cells suspended in a buffered histidine solution.
