TI  == [incidence and characteristics of bronchial colonisation in patient with lung cancer: a retrospective study of 388 cases].
AB  == introduction: bronchial colonisation is frequently reported in patients with lung cancer. these colonisations could influence patient therapeutic management and prognosis. the aim of our study is refine incidence and nature of bronchial colonisations in patients presenting with lung cancer. methods: three hundred and eighty-eight patients with lung cancer underwent a flexible bronchoscopy at the time of diagnosis. among them, 216 patients had a bacteriological, mycobacteriological and fungal investigation. type and frequency of these colonisations were analyzed. results: potential pathogens were found in 39.8% of  samples, including mainly 39.8% of gram-negative bacilli (haemophilus influenzae, enterobacter sp., escherichia coli). in addition, we found 0.9% of mycobacteria and 13.9% of candida albicans. among these 216 patients where microbiological analysis was performed, patient features and tumor stage were not significantly correlated to microbial colonisation. conclusions: colonisation of airways is frequently reported when a lung cancer is diagnosed. our data suggest that bronchial colonisation should be prospectively collected due to its potential interest in the management of lung cancer patients.

TI  == frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in makkah, saudi arabia.
AB  == objective: to estimate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of the gram-negative bacteria isolated from 2 hospitals in makkah. methods: this study was undertaken in 2 main tertiary care hospitals namely; al-noor specialist hospital, and hera hospital in makkah, kingdom of saudi arabia from october 2005  to march 2006. a total of 1137 gram-negative bacteria were identified in non-duplicate clinical specimens obtained from 965 patients of various body sites infections. demographic data, identity of microorganisms, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were obtained from medical and laboratory records. results: the  most prevalent gram-negative bacteria were escherichia coli (31.6%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.2%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (10.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%), klebsiella sp. (6.2%), haemophilus influenzae (3.7%), proteus sp. (3.3%), and enterobacter sp. (1.9%). results demonstrated that gram-negative bacteria have a high rate of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. furthermore, multi-drug resistance was also common in this study. conclusion: our data showed a high rate of resistance among gram-negative pathogens in comparison with other countries in the world. the implementation of  monitoring programs is an important part of the prevention strategy against the development of antibiotic resistance in hospitals.

TI  == [hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. this study describes the incidence of hap in poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and  use of mechanical ventilation. the epidemiology of hap as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. data for this study was acquired from the registry of hospital-acquired infectious diseases for the year  1998. out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be hap. this study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed hap (0.3%). death occurred in 260 of 920 hap  cases or 30%; and hap found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). the greatest incidence of hap was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. the most frequently isolated causal agents were the gram-negative rods (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp.), and staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of hap in this population. it was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. the isolated strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). in the enterobacteriaceae family, klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.

TI  == cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  == topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. the anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have  been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. the pathogens used were branhamella catarrhalis, enterobacter sp., haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. the bacteria  studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. these topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical  anesthetics when culturing specimens. this is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. this type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. a modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.

TI  == the pattern of respiratory infection in patients with lung cancer.
AB  == we examined retrospectively the pattern of respiratory infection in 579 patients  with lung cancer admitted to nagasaki university hospital during the past 15 years. a total of 139 patients (24.0%) developed respiratory infection. the rates of pulmonary infection associated with large (36.2%) and small cell carcinomas (33.6%) were significantly higher than those with squamous cell carcinoma (26.0%) and adenocarcinoma (17.3%). advanced stages of lung cancer were associated with higher complication rates (stage i: 6.3%, stage ii: 15.9%, stage iii: 27.9%, and  stage iv: 33.8%). deceased patients showed a significantly higher rate of pulmonary infection than alive patients during the period of investigation. isolated organisms in excess of 10(7) cfu/ml in sputum or 10(4) cfu/ml in bronchial aspirate were mainly gram-negative bacteria (68.8%), such as haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the number of patients infected with gram-positive bacteria increased markedly after 1982. our results suggest that a successful control of pulmonary infection associated with lung cancer is important in improving the prognosis of lung malignancy.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == [ru 51807 (cefpodoxime proxetil). in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of  a new orally administered active cephalosporin].
AB  == cefpodoxime proxetil (ru 51807) is an enterally absorbed ester prodrug which is rapidly cleaved in vivo after oral administration, with release of the active free acid metabolite cefpodoxime. the in vitro antibacterial activity of the sodium salt of cefpodoxime (ru 51746) against approximately 800 clinical isolates was evaluated comparatively with other orally active beta-lactams. ru 51746 was found to be active against enterobacteria normally susceptible to third generation cephalosporins, with mic50 values ranging from 0.02 mg/l (providencia  sp) to 5 mg/l (c. freundii). ru 51746 was also active against h. influenzae, including beta-lactamase producing strains (mic50 0.04 mg/l), oxa-s s. aureus (2,5), beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.05) and s. pneumoniae (0.002). oxa-r staphylococci and p. aeruginosa were resistant to ru 51746 (mic50 greater than 40 mg/l for both organisms). the antibacterial activity of ru 51746 was bactericidal in nature and independent from test conditions. the molecule was stable to all the beta-lactamases studied, with the exception of cefuroximase (type ic). ru 51746 exhibited no strong inhibitory effects on these enzymes, except with enterobacter p99 (type ia). a good correlation was found between in vivo activity of ru 51807 and in vitro activity of ru 51746. cefpodoxime proxetil was found to  be more effective than cefaclor in mice with experimental septicemia caused by various streptococci, with a dp50 ratio in the 10-100 range. this advantage was again evidenced for septicemias due to various enterobacteria. in contrast, cefaclor proved more effective in experimental staphylococcus infections. in mice with experimental pneumonia, cefpodoxime proxetil caused sharp falls in k. pneumoniae lung counts. six days after induction of the infection, 60% of animals under cefpodoxime proxetil had sterile lungs, versus 25% of animals under amoxicillin.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin and piperacillin plus tazobactam towards beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates.
AB  == the authors evaluated the in-vitro antibacterial activity of piperacillin alone and of piperacillin combined with tazobactam, a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, on  398 clinical isolates, both gram-positive and gram-negative. the piperacillin/tazobactam combination was evaluated in the fixed ratio 8:1. the vast majority of the microorganisms tested had reduced susceptibility to piperacillin (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range 0.12- greater than 256 mg/l) due to beta-lactamase production. the following results were obtained: against haemophilus influenzae, tazobactam was effective in reducing the mics of  piperacillin by 512 fold. the activity of piperacillin/tazobactam was lower against pseudomonas sp., while some activity was demonstrated against some strains of klebsiella. good activity was seen not only against methicillin-susceptible (ms) staphylococci but also against some methicillin-resistant (mr) strains. in the latter, the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam was active only if the strains showed beta-lactamase production. these findings are interesting above all in regard to the synergistic effect demonstrated against mr beta-lactamase producing staphylococci and the klebsiella-enterobacter-serratia (kes) group.

TI  == efficacy and safety of cefpirome (hr810).
AB  == sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and  joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were escherichia coli (6), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and haemophilus influenzae (1). one patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. in wound cultures, three strains of staphylococcus aureus and one each of ps. aeruginosa and str. faecalis persisted. one enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. of isolated strains, only str. faecalis and methicillin resistant staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. adverse  effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). tolerance was good. cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.

TI  == bacteraemia at the university hospital of the west indies--a report of 222 cases.
AB  == a total of 222 cases of septicaemia was recorded at the university hospital of the west indies between june 1982 and june 1983. this gave an overall incidence of 16.1 per 1000 admissions. the 233 bacterial strains isolated comprised 100 gram-positive and 133 gram-negative organisms with klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent. highest rates of septicaemia were recorded in patients less than 1 year and over  50 years of age. septicaemia caused by gram-positive organisms was predominantly  a disease of children whereas that caused by gram-negative organisms arose more often in neonates and in patients over 50 years of age. a predisposing factor was noted in 104 patients of whom 42 had neoplastic disease. the most frequently identified initial sites of infection were the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the meninges. most blood stream infections were community-acquired, three quarters of all septicaemic patients being admitted to  the departments of medicine or paediatrics. there were 11 cases of polymicrobial  septicaemia caused predominantly by gram-negative organisms in patients with underlying disease. appropriate antimicrobial drugs were administered to 57% of septicaemic patients whereas 17% received superfluous antimicrobial therapy. in those patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy there was a marked increase in mortality. forty of 61 deaths were attributed to septicaemia.  mortality from septicaemia caused by gram-negative organisms was 21% compared with 13% for that caused by gram-positive organisms. the organisms associated with the highest case fatality rates were escherichia coli, 53%; enterobacter sp., 27%; and beta-haemolytic streptococci 24%. there were no deaths from septicaemia caused by haemophilus influenzae, salmonella sp. or serratia sp. the  highest mortality rates were associated with neoplastic disease, diabetes, polymicrobial septicaemia, urinary tract infections and old age.

TI  == efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. the majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. one hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. the clinical response rates, by organism, were: streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter sp, serratia sp, pseudomonas sp, klebsiella sp, citrobacter sp, and morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). in the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other us trials of the drug. the findings indicate that ceftizoxime,  1 to 2 gm bid, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract  infections in hospitalized patients. this low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
