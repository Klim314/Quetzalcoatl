TI  == active dry saccharomyces cerevisiae can alleviate the effect of subacute ruminal  acidosis in lactating dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of the study was to determine the effect of active dry saccharomyces cerevisiae (adsc) supplementation on dry matter intake, milk yield, milk components, ruminal ph, and microbial community during a dietary regimen that leads to subacute ruminal acidosis (sara). sixteen multiparous, rumen-cannulated lactating holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments that included adsc (biomate; ab vista, marlborough, uk; 8 x 10(10) cfu/head per day) or control. during wk 1 to 6, all cows received a high-forage (hf) diet (77:23, forage:concentrate). cows were then abruptly switched during wk 7 to a high-grain (hg) diet (49:51, forage:concentrate) and remained on the hg until the end of wk 10. feed intake and milk yields were recorded daily. ruminal  ph was recorded continuously using an indwelling system for 1 to 2 d per week during the pre-experimental phase, and wk 6, 7, and 10. ruminal digesta samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed for relative change in microbial communities using real-time quantitative pcr. cows were considered to have sara if the duration below ph 5.6 was >/=300 min/d. ruminal ph during wk 6 (hf plateau) was not different across treatments (15 +/- 46 min/d at ph <5.6). the dietary regimen successfully induced sara during wk 7 (transition from hf to  hg diet), and ruminal ph (551 +/- 46 min/d at ph <5.6) was not different across treatments. however, cows receiving adsc had an improved ruminal ph (122 +/- 57 vs. 321 +/- 53 min/d at ph <5.6) during wk 10 (hg plateau) compared with control. additionally, cows receiving adsc had a better dry matter intake (23.3 +/- 0.66 vs. 21.6 +/- 0.61 kg/d) and 4% fat-corrected milk yield (29.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 26.5 +/- 1.2 kg/d) than control cows during the hg phase (wk 8 to 10). during hg feeding, cows receiving adsc had greater total volatile fatty acid and propionate concentrations (175 +/- 7.5 vs. 154 +/- 7.5 and 117 +/- 6.1 vs. 94 +/- 5.7 mm for adsc and control, respectively) and lower acetate:propionate ratio (0.26 +/- 0.5  vs. 0.36 +/- 0.05 for adsc and control, respectively). microbial analyses conducted on samples collected during wk 10 showed that cows supplemented with s. cerevisiae had a 9-fold, 2-fold, 6-fold, 1.3-fold, and 8-fold increase in s. cerevisiae, fibrobacter succinogenes, anaerovibrio lipolytica, ruminococcus albus, and anaerobic fungi, respectively, which suggested an increase in cellulolytic microbes within the rumen. cows supplemented with adsc had 2.2-fold  reduction in prevotella albensis, which is a gram-negative bacterium predominant  during sara. prevotella spp. are suggested to be an important source of lipopolysaccharide responsible for inflammation within the rumen. cows supplemented with adsc had a 2.3-fold increase in streptococcus bovis and a 12-fold reduction in megasphaera elsdenii. the reduction in m. elsdenii may reflect lower concentration of lactic acid within the rumen for adsc cows. in conclusion, adsc supplementation to dairy cows was demonstrated to alleviate the  condition of sara caused by abrupt dietary changes from hf to hg, and can potentially improve rumen function, as indicated by greater numbers of cellulolytic microorganisms within the rumen.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == effect of aspergillus oryzae extract alone or in combination with antimicrobial compounds on ruminal bacteria.
AB  == the effect of an aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract on the growth rates of pure cultures of ruminal bacteria was determined. bacteria were grown in an anaerobic ruminal fluid and carbohydrate medium. a sterile filtrate made with 10% a. oryzae was added to the medium at 2 or 5% (vol/vol) to provide a final a. oryzae concentration of 2 or 5 mg/ml, respectively. the filtrate had no effect on the growth rates of 10 of the 19 ruminal bacteria tested; however, the filtrate increased the growth rates of the bacteria that digest fiber, ruminococcus albus  and fibrobacter succinogenes, and the bacteria that utilize lactate, megasphaera  elsdenii, selenomonas lactilytica, and selenomonas ruminantium. no differences in growth rate were detected between the two concentrations of a. oryzae filtrate. we also investigated the interactions between a. oryzae and antimicrobial compounds on the growth rates of six species of ruminal bacteria that had shown positive responses or no response to the filtrate. the addition of a. oryzae filtrate to medium containing chlortetracycline or neomycin tended to diminish the negative effects of those compounds on the growth rates of some ruminal bacteria, although the bacteria had no positive growth response to the filtrate alone. in contrast, the combination of a. oryzae filtrate and tylosin decreased the growth rate of sel. ruminantium d. these results indicated that a. oryzae stimulates growth of some bacteria that digest fiber and ferment lactate in the rumen and interacts positively or negatively with certain antimicrobial feed additives.

TI  == effects of a saccharomyces cerevisiae culture on ruminal bacteria that utilize lactate and digest cellulose.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the effects of a yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) culture on lactate utilization and cellulose digestion by ruminal bacteria. growth of selenomonas ruminantium hd4 in medium that contained 5 g/l of dl-lactate, trypticase, and yeast extract was stimulated 7 and 15% by 1 and 5% (vol/vol) yeast culture filtrate respectively. the 1 and 5% yeast culture filtrate stimulated growth of selenomonas ruminantium h18 and megasphaera elsdenii b159 and t81 on 5 g/l of dl-lactate in medium without trypticase or yeast extract. growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85 and ruminococcus albus b199 on 6 g/l of cellobiose was stimulated by the addition of yeast culture filtrate to medium without trypticase or yeast extract. the yeast culture filtrate increased the concentrations of acetate and total volatile fatty acids that were  produced by sel. ruminantium hd4 and increased the concentrations of propionate and total volatile fatty acids that were produced by sel. ruminantium h18 but did not alter end-product formation of m. elsdenii or cellulolytic bacteria. treatment with yeast culture increased the initial rate but not the extent of cellulose digestion by f. succinogenes s85 and ruminococcus flavefaciens fd1. collectively, these results suggest that yeast culture provides soluble growth factors (i.e., organic acids, b vitamins, and amino acids) that stimulate growth  of ruminal bacteria that utilize lactate and digest cellulose.

TI  == activity of h(+)-atpase in ruminal bacteria with special reference to acid tolerance.
AB  == batch culture experiments showed that permeabilized cells and membranes of ruminococcus albus and fibrobacter succinogenes, acid-intolerant celluloytic bacteria, have only one-fourth to one-fifth as much h(+)-atpase as megasphaera elsdenii and streptococcus bovis, which are relatively acid tolerant. even in the cells grown in continuous culture at ph 7.0, the acid-intolerant bacteria contained less than half as much h(+)-atpase as the acid-tolerant bacteria. the amounts of h(+)-atpase in the acid-tolerant bacteria were increased by more than  twofold when the cells were grown at the lowest ph permitting growth, whereas little increase was observed in the case of the acid-intolerant bacteria. these results indicate that the acid-intolerant bacteria not only contain smaller amounts of h(+)-atpase at neutral ph but also have a lower capacity to enhance the level of h(+)-atpase in response to low ph than the acid-tolerant bacteria. in addition, the h(+)-atpases of the acid-intolerant bacteria were more sensitive to low ph than those of the acid-tolerant bacteria, although the optimal phs were similar.

TI  == rapid diagnosis of anaerobic gram-positive cocci by salt tolerance.
AB  == the maximum salt tolerance was 2.5% in cases of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptococcus prevotii, 3% in ruminococcus albus, 4% in acidaminococcus fermentans, peptococcus niger and megasphaera elsdenii and 5% in peptococcus magnus. the biochemical tests being largely inactive and time consuming the findings of salt  tolerance if combined with those of morphological data provide clue to the rapid  identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.

TI  == antibiotic activity of an isocyanide metabolite of trichoderma hamatum against rumen bacteria.
AB  == a metabolite of trichoderma hamatum, 3-(3-isocyanocyclopent-2-enylidene)propionic acid, was tested for its effects on growth of and carbohydrate metabolism in 11 strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. to standardize the biological activity of this unstable metabolite, a rapid, aerobic disc diffusion assay was developed using escherichia coli atcc 11775. in an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid and containing a soluble carbohydrate, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the metabolite which completely inhibited growth of the rumen bacteria for 18 h at 39 degrees c was generally less than 10  micrograms x ml-1; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for megasphaera elsdenii b159 and streptococcus bovis pe(1)8 were 10-25 and 25-64 micrograms x ml-1, respectively. in general, the gram-negative strains were more sensitive than the gram positive. the minimum inhibitory concentration for bacteroides ruminicola 23 grown with glucose was 1 micrograms x ml-1; for b. ruminicola ga33  (glucose), b. succinogenes s85 (cellobiose), and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 (maltose), it was 2 microgram x ml-1. when added to a cellulose-containing rumen  fluid medium, 1-4 micrograms x ml-1 of the metabolite delayed cellulose hydrolysis by b. succinogenes s85, ruminococcus albus 7, and r. flavefaciens fd1  for up to 4 days, and 6-7 micrograms x ml-1 prevented hydrolysis for at least 1 month. in the presence of the metabolite, the proportion of acetate produced from soluble carbohydrate by the majority of strains increased, but with some strains  net production of acetate decreased relative to production of other acidic fermentation products.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effects of chetomin on growth and acidic fermentation products of rumen bacteria.
AB  == chetomin, an antibiotic metabolite of chaetomium spp., was tested in the form of  its tetrathiol derivative for its effects on growth and carbohydrate metabolism by five strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. the compound was bacteriostatic for the strains tested and gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition than gram-negative bacteria. in an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of chetomin which completely inhibited growth of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1 for 18 h at 39 degrees c was 40 micrograms x ml-1. the mics determined under the same conditions for megasphaera elsdenii b159, selenomonas ruminantium ga192, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 were 160, 600, and 60 micrograms x ml-1, respectively. the mic for cellulose hydrolysis by ruminococcus albus 7 was 20 micrograms x ml-1. chetomin at concentrations below the mic appeared to inhibit the separation and division of cells in cultures of b. fibrisolvens d1. chetomin consistently stimulated acetate production from glucose by b. fibrisolvens d1, m. elsdenii b159, and s. ruminantium ga192 at the expense  of compounds which comprised major soluble end products of fermentation in cultures lacking chetomin.

TI  == nutritional interdependence among rumen bacteria, bacteroides amylophilus, megasphaera elsdenii, and ruminococcus albus.
AB  == nutritional interdependence among three representatives of rumen bacteria, bacteroides amylophilus, megasphaera elsdenii, and ruminococcus albus, was studied with a basal medium consisting of minerals, vitamins, cysteine hydrochloride, and nh(4). b. amylophilus grew well in the basal medium supplemented with starch and produced branched-chain amino acids after growth ceased. when cocultured with b. amylophilus in the basal medium supplemented with starch and glucose, amino acid-dependent m. elsdenii produced an appreciable amount of branched-chain fatty acids, which are essential growth factors for cellulolytic r. albus. a small addition of starch (0.1 to 0.3%) to the basal medium containing glucose and cellobiose brought about successive growth of the three species in the order of b. amylophilus, m. elsdenii, and r. albus, and successive growth was substantiated by the formation of branched-chain amino acids and fatty acids in the culture. supplementation with 0.5% starch, however,  failed to support the growth of r. albus. on the basis of these results, the effects of supplementary starch or branched-chain fatty acids on cellulose digestion in the rumen was discussed.

TI  == effect of ph on the efficiency of growth by pure cultures of rumen bacteria in continuous culture.
AB  == a total of 10 strains of rumen bacteria, selenomonas ruminantium hd4, megasphaera elsdenii b159, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens a38, streptococcus bovis jb1, lactobacillus vitulinus ga1, bacteroides ruminicola b14, b. ruminicola ga33, ruminococcus albus 7, ruminococcus flavefaciens c94, and bacteroides succinogenes s85, were grown in energy-limiteh of the medium reservoir was lowered approximately 0.3 ph units, and the energy source concentration remaining in the  culture vessel, optical density, cell mass, and ph were determined. a low ph appeared to have a detrimental effect on cell yields. large variations were seen  among strains in both the magnitude of yield depressions at lower ph values and in the ph at which the culture washed out. lactate analysis indicated ta are discussed in relation to the effect of ph on the efficiency of protein synthesis  in the rumen and rumen microbial ecology.

TI  == characterization of a cytoplasmic reserve glucan from ruminococcus albus.
AB  == ruminococcus albus, an anaerobic bacterium that digests cellulose in the rumen of cattle, produces intracellular polysaccharide granules varying from 0.05 to 0.31  mum in diameter when grown in batch culture. this polysaccharide material was purified and found to contain d-glucose as the only reducing sugar. the polyglucose polymer was slightly opalescent in aqueous solution and formed a strong reddish purple iodine complex with a maximum absorbance at 550 nm. its infrared spectrum had characteristic absorption bands at 8.70, 9.25, and 9.75 mum and was identical with that of the amylopectin-glycogen type of megasphaera elsdenii and that of the glycogen of enteric bacteria and beef liver. it reacted  strongly with concanavalin a. methylation analysis showed that the glucan contained 2,3,4,6-tetra-o-meg-2,3,6-tri-o-meg-2,3-di-o-meg in a ratio of 8:84:8.  characterization of the products obtained by treatment with isoamylase indicates  that the glucan of r. albus is of the glycogen type.

TI  == studies on some characteristics of hydrogen production by cell-free extracts of rumen anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == hydrogen production was studied in the following rumen anaerobes: bacteroides clostridiiformis, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, enbacterium limosum, fusobacterium necrophorum, megasphaera elsdenii, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens. clostridium pasteurianum and escherichia coli were included for comparative purposes. hydrogen production from dithionite, dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, pyruvate, and formate was determined. all species tested produced hydrogen from dithionite-reduce methyl viologen, but only c. pasteurianum, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, and m. elsdenii produced hydrogen  from dithionite. all species except e. coli produced hydrogen from pyruvate, but  activity was low or absent in extracts of e. limosum, f. necrophorum, r. albus, and r. flavefaciens unless methyl viologen was added. hydrogen was produced from  formate only by e. coli, b. clostridiiformis, e. limosum, f. necrophorum, and r.  flavefaciens. extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in an effort to determine the solubility of hydrogenase. the hydrogenase of all species except e. coli appeared to be soluble, although variable amounts of hydrogenase activity were detected in the pellet. treatment of extracts of the rumen microbial species with deae-cellulose resulted in loss ofhydrogen production from pyruvate. activity was restored by the addition of methyl viologen. it is concluded that hydrogen production in these rumen microorganisms is similar to that in the saccharolytic clostridia.
